<subject>SUBJECT: Implementation of the Batch System of Submitting and Processing of Vouchers for Claims under Rural Health Offices.</subject>

<body>
To facilitate processing of claims of all personnel, minimize undue special attention given to certain personnel, red tape and to avoid unneccessary travels of personnel of the Rural Health Units for submitting only their individual claims for reimbursement of expenses, the following procedures are hereby prescribed:

1. Vouchers should be prepared immediately after the completion of task assigned or at the end of every month and shall be submitted to the Chief of Rural Health Units on the third day of the following month.

2. The Chief of Rural Health Units should verify the veracity of the claim and affix his initial under the space provided for the signature of the Provincial Health Officer and should prepare a list of these vouchers to be forwarded with the claims to the Provincial Health Offices on the fifth day of the month.

3. The Provincial Health Officer should compile and number chronologically the vouchers from all units in the province after ascertaining that all claims are properly documented and signed. He should accomplish nine (9) legible copies of the "List of Vouchers of Claims", Appendix A attached, for each kind of expenditures, to wit - (1) gasoline, (2) kerosene, (3) traveling or per diems -, to be forwarded with the claims in labelled folders, to the Regional Health Office not later than the tenth of the month.

4. The Budget and Finance Section should assign consecutive numbers to the batch as they arrive, on the top portion of all the copies of the "List" before acknowledging receipt on the lower portion of same and promptly send back a copy to the Provincial Health Office for its file. The Budget Officer should fill the column "Amount as Approved" with the amount allowed for each individual claim, forward the batch with the original and two (2) copies of the ROA to the authorities concerned for approval. He should also be responsible for all the vouchers until the Accounting Office acknowledges receipt thereof. The Budget Office will adhere to the prescribed procedure with or without sufficient funds.

5. The Accounting Office, after filling the receipt portion of the "List" should send a copy to the Budget and Finance Section for its file and should proceed with the processing of the vouchers making sure that each claim is properly excess of available allotment, a journal voucher should be drawn to reflect excess obligations over allotment pending the batch affected until the receipt of the Advice for additional allotment. The processed batch with available funds will be forwarded to the Regional Auditor, if pre-audit is required.

6. From the Auditor's Office, the pre-audited vouchers listed in batch should be delivered to the Cashier's Office for check preparation. The batch with claims subject for corrections should pass thru the Accounting Office for proper notation and/or adjustments before checks can be drawn for the corrected amount.

7. The Cashier should take responsibility of the checks and pre-audited vouchers while the checks are in the process for the signature of officials concerned. After completion, the Cashier should accomplish columns 5 to 7 in the "List". The originals and duplicates of the list together with the paid vouchers and all supporting papers should be submitted to the Accounting Office before the close of the office hour on the date the checks are countersigned. Two copies of the list will be sent to the Provincial Health Office with the Checks.

8. The Provincial Health Office should immediately return a copy of the list as an acknowledgement of the receipt of the checks and the other copy should be posted in the bulletin board for the information of all concerned. The Provincial Health Officer should cause the immediate delivery of the checks to the respective claimants through the heads of the Rural Health Units.

9. The Accounting Office shall enter in the Journal of Checks issued the total amount in the "List" indicating the first and last number of the checks issued, and subsequently post the same on Section C of the ROA. Within two weeks after the vouchers are indexed and entered in the appropriate books of accounts, the copy of the list together with the original vouchers and documents supporting the claims should be submitted to the Auditor for post audit.

In line with GAO Circular 75-A, the Cashier's Office may use the "List" and dispense with the "Report of Disbursement by Checks", thereby minimizing the volume of work of the Cashier. The "Remarks" column may be utilized by the individual office to suit its purpose, the Accounting Office as folio for entry in the journals and posting of the date of the encashment of the checks and the Provincial Health Office for acknowledgement of checks distributed to personnel or rural health officials.

Delayed vouchers shall only be accepted upon submission of a written explanation for the delay and shall only be processed when approved in writing by the Regional Health Director as recommended by the Provincial Health Officer. Personnel assigned to difficult areas may be allowed to submit claims after the prescribed date by presenting a written request for exemption, citing the difficulties.

Vouchers which are defective one to lack of supporting papers and which are incorrectly prepared shall be detached from the batch and deleted from the "List" of the Provincial Health Office. They shall be returned to the point where correction/corrections are needed and which the Provincial Health Office wikll include in the "List" (see Appendix B) of the late and defective claims currently being prepared. The submission of this batch to the Regional Health Office will be made monthly together with the regular batch.

Under no circumstances, other than that mentioned in the preceding paragraph, shall a voucher be withdrawn from the batch to effect speedy processing of claims nor shall checks be released by the Regional Office to individual claimants other than the Provincial Health Officer or his duly designated liaison officer. Any rural health personnel and other officials and employees concerned who fail to comply with the prescribed procedure stated above shall be dealt with administratively.

All field personnel should be promptly circularized of this Order by posting a copy on the bulletin board of each rural health office.

For ready reference and information, the Cashier, shall provide a blackboard on a conspicuous place indicating the "Schedule of Payments Made to Field Personnel" (see Appendix C).

All previous issuances in conflict wholly or partly with any of the provisions of this Order are hereby rescinded and modified accordingly.

Strict compliance with the above instructions is hereby enjoined.
