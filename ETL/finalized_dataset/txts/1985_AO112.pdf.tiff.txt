		a) Certification from the Health Authorities of the country of origin, duly authenticated by the Philippine Consulate, attesting to the status of the manufacturer and stating the country’s laws and regulations governing quality control of food color additives.

	(This requirement shall be waived if the status of the manufacturer has been previously ascertained and the same is officially recognized as among those in “good standing” by the BFAD)

		b) A copy of the preform invoice for the substances being imported; and
		c) A copy of the sales invoice of the latest preceding importation.
	3. All incoming shipment shall be inspected and analyzed by the BFAD before authorizing its release from the port of entry. Should there be any delay in the BFAD laboratory analysis, the shipment may be released to the importer provided it shall not be disposed until authorized by the BFAD.
