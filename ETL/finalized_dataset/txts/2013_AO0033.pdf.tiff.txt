JOINT ORDER No.2013 - 0033


TO: All PhilHealth Ofﬁces, Government Hospitals and All Other Concerned 



I. RATIONALE 

Republic Act (RA) No. 7875 as amended by RA No. 10606 prescribes that: “the National Health Insurance Program (NHIP) shall provide all citizens the mechanisms to gain financial access to health services, in combination with other government health programs. The NHIP shall give the highest priority to achieving coverage of the entire population”. Furthermore, Section 3 (c) of the same law emphasizes the need to “prioritize and accelerate the provision of health services to all Filipinos, especially that segment of the population who cannot afford such services”. Moreover, Section 7 clearly mentions that "all indigents not enrolled in the Program shall have priority in the use and availment of the services and facilities of government hospitals....Provided, however that such government health care providers shall ensure that said indigents shall subsequently be enrolled in the Program”. 

Hence, in order to assure that none of the poor are left to chance, it is imperative that patients including their families not covered by PhilHealth at the point of service shall be enrolled accordingly by the admitting institutional health care institution and that PhilHealth shall appropriately reimburses these government health care institutions for the services extended to indigent population. 

II. OBJECTIVES 

This Manual of Operations and Procedures (MOP) aims to set the governing policies and operational guidelines in the enrollment of Hospital—Sponsored Members (HSM) under the Point of Care Enrollment Program in government hospitals and their immediate availment of PhilHealth beneﬁts.

-Guide the stakeholders concerned in the implementation of the program 
-Provide rules and procedures in the identiﬁcation, enrolment and availment of NHIP beneﬁts of qualiﬁed HSMs

I. PURPOSE 

This Manual of Operations and Procedures aims to provide the step-by-step process and the undertakings of each concerned institution and office to attain seamless and effective implementation of the enrollment of eligible families and individuals at the Point of Care. 

II. RATIONALE AND OBJECTIVE 

The government through the Department of Health (DOH) and the Philippine Health Insurance Corporation (PhilHealth) continues to device mechanisms to enroll all Filipinos to the National Health Insurance Program (NHlP) especially the underprivileged group of the society and that this group should also receive quality health care services with no out-of—pocket expenditures. As the Universal Health Care (UHC), or Kalusugang Pangkalahatan (KP), aspires to attain and improve the implementation of the compulsory nature of membership to the Program and to avoid adverse selection, the government either through the National Government, Local Government or other sponsors shall subsidize the Indigent members’ premium contributions. 

Invariably, despite all efforts exerted by the government to enroll all the indigents, there are still some leakages that not all the poor are covered and are not protected when they need to avail of vital health services at the point of care. Hence, in order to assure that no one of the indigents or poor are left to chance, it is imperative that there should be a mechanism on how to capture this group of population and be part of the compulsory nature of the NHIP. 

Therefore, in line with the thrust of KP, it is incumbent for government to assure that even those indigents missed out in the identification processes must be covered in the National Health Insurance Program (NHlP) by PhilHealth. With the Health Care institutions (HC|s) existing capability to assess the capacity of their patients/families to pay through an interview administered by their Medical Social Worker using the tool prescribed by DOH through Administrative Order 51-A s. 2001, the HCI may enroll families not covered by the NHIP at the Point of Care.
