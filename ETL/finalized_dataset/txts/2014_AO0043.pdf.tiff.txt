<subject>Subject: Guidelines on the Estimation of Unmet Need for Modern Family Planning 
</subject>
<body>
 
I. BACKGROUND 

Section 8.02 of the Implementing Rules and Regulation of RA 10354, otherwise known as “The Responsible Parenthood and Reproductive Health Act of 2012,” mandates DOH to develop a methodology to determine the number of women with unmet need for modern family planning, among others. Unmet need shall be used in identifying and prioritizing interventions to address gaps in accessing family planning services. Together with the estimated number of current users, it will be one of the bases in forecasting FP commodity requirements. 

These guidelines shall provide the steps in determining current levels and projections of number of women with unmet need for modern family planning, which would be the basis of allocations for budget and FF supplies pursuant to the above-cited provision of the IRR. 

II. OBJECTIVES 

This Order shall provide the guidelines for estimating unmet need for modern FP which will be used for planning by the DOH and LGUs. 

III. SCOPE AND COVERAGE 

This Order shall apply to the DOH Central Ofﬁce Units, DOH Regional Ofﬁces (DOHROs), local government units (LGUs) including ARMM, and the private sector. 

IV. DEFINITION OF TERMS 

A. Modern Contraceptive Prevalence Rate (mCPR) shall refer to the proportion of women from 15-49 years old who are currently using (or whose partner is using) any modern method of contraception or family planning, which includes: the pill; female and male sterilization; IUD; injectables; implants; condom; and, natural FP methods such as cervical mucus, basal body temperature method (BBT), symptothermal method, standard days method (SDM) and lactational amenorrhea method (LAM). The formula for computing mCPR is as follows: 

mCPR = (Current Users of Modern FP / WRA) X 100% 

B. Unmet Need for Modern Family Flaming shall refer to the proportion of women who are fertile and sexually active but are not using any modern method of contraception, and report not wanting any more children or wanting to delay the birth of their next child. It is computed as follows: 

Unmet Need Rate = (Number of Women with Unmet Need for Modern FP / WRA) x 100% 

C. Eligible population shall refer to the segment of the population that require a certain type of service. In family planning, this is the segment of the population who are eligible to practice contraception or women of reproductive age (WRA). 

D. Women of Reproductive Age (WRA) shall refer to women aged 15-49 years old, which include those who are (1) currently using any modern FP method, (2) with unmet need for modern FP, (3) want to get pregnant within two years or want their current pregnancy, (4) sexually inactive and (5) not fertile. 

V. GENERAL GUIDELINES 

A. The magnitude of women with unmet need for modern family planning shall be used in identifying interventions in priority population groups or localities for RH services. 

B. Proportions of unmet need for and current users of modern FP shall be based on the latest National Demographic Health Survey (NDHS). Other surveys with rider questions on FF should follow the protocol and standard questions on family planning of the NDHS. The latest household surveys particularly the Census of Population and Housing shall be the bases for estimating population. 

D. The DOH, as mandated by the IRR, shall procure, distribute to LGUs and monitor the usage of family planning supplies for the whole country. However, it shall prioritize the poor as identiﬁed by the National Housing Targeting System for Poverty Reduction (NHTS-PR) or other government procedures of identifying the marginalized. It will secure resource and budgetary requirements of NHTS-PR households taking into consideration resources from national government and partners or donors. 

D. DOH shall procure commodities based on approved FP Program Methods and drugs and devices included in the Philippine National Drug Formulary (PNDF). 

E. Distribution of FF commodities and supplies to service delivery points, Provincial Health Ofﬁces and DOH Regional Ofﬁces shall be based on projected utilization rate per quarter. 

VI. SPECIFIC GUIDELINES 

A. Estimating the number of women with unmet need for modern family planning shall follow these steps (See Annex A for sample computations): 

1. Estimate population for a particular year using the latest projections from the Philippine Statistics Authority or by multiplying the population estimate with the average growth rate. The estimated population and corresponding growth rates per region, province or municipality shall be based on the latest Census of Population and Housing. For NHTS-PR poor households, use the roster to get the actual number and age of members in a household. 

2. Compute for the number of WRA by multiplying total population with the proportion of WRA in the population. Regional proportions from the latest Census of Population and Housing shall be used to estimate number of WRA for provinces. 

For NHTS—PR for poor households, use the actual number of WRA by getting the sum of women 15-49 years old from the roster. 

3. Estimate the number of women with unmet need for modern family planning by multiplying the proportion of women with unmet need from the latest NDHS by the estimated number of WRA. Regional proportions of unmet need shall be used to estimate number of WRA with unmet need for provinces. 

Since the number of women with unmet need for modern family planning cannot be extracted from NHTS-PR, multiply the number of WRA with the proportion of women with unmet need. 

In areas where at least 90% of NHTS—PR poor households have been visited by community volunteers such as CHTs, the actual number of women with unmet need shall be determined from reports such as health use plans. 

4. Estimate the number of women who are current users of modern family planning by multiplying the proportion of women who are current users of modern FP methods from the latest NDHS by the estimated WRA. Regional proportions of current users shall be used to estimate number of WRA who are current users for provinces. 

Since the number of women who are current users of modern family planning cannot be extracted from NHTS-PR, multiply the number of WRA with the proportion of current users of modern FP. 

In areas where at least 90% of NHTS-PR poor households have been visited by community volunteers such as CHTs, the actual number of current users shall be determined from reports such as health use plans. 

B. Forecast commodity requirements for current users as well as for women with unmet need for modern family planning methods for the total population and for WRA from NHTS-PR households. The following steps shall be used in forecasting commodity requirements: 

1. Determine ideal method mix by:

a.Distributing WRA with unmet need for modern FP across the different FP methods such as pills — combined oral contraceptives (COC) and progestin only contraceptives (POC), injectables, male condoms, IUD, subdermal implants, BTL, NSV and natural FP — basal body temperature method, cervical mucus method, symptotherrnal method, standard days method (SDM), lactation amenorrhea method (LAM). Preferences in a province, region or country may be based on data gathered by community health volunteers or community-level providers.


b.Distribute WRA who are current users of a modern FP method based on latest method mix derived from administrative data or those gathered by community health volunteers or from the NDHS. To support shifters, redistribute proportion of current users, except for BTL and NSV, across methods towards permanent or more effective methods. 

c.Get average proportion for each method from those with unmet need and current users of modern FP. 

2. Multiply the average proportion for each method by the total number of WRA with unmet need and current users to estimate the number users per FP method. BTL and NSV are not included in commodity forecasting but the estimated number of users would indicate requirements for training of health providers, infrastructure and equipment, as well as outreach services needed. 

3. Compute for total number of units required for each method by multiplying the estimated number of users with the number of units required to protect a woman or couple from getting pregnant in one year. Note that the estimated number of units needed in one year has taken into consideration possible wastage during delivery, storage, distribution and dispensing. The following are the required number of units per year: pills — 15, injectables — 5, IUD - 3, subdermal implants — 3, condoms — 144, and NFP — 1. 

4. Compute for total cost of FP commodities by multiplying unit cost of each commodity with the total number of units required. Unit cost can be based on the prevailing market price or procurement cost of the DOH. 

VII. ROLES AND RESPONSIBILITIES

Annex A: Sample Computations 


Following is a sample computation to estimate the number of women with unmet need and forecast FP commodity requirements. Note that proportions are based from the 2008 NDHS. It translates instructions in this issuance to formula. DOH will issue updated proportions based on the latest 2013 NDHS. 

A. Estimating the number of women with unmet need for modern family planning 

1. Estimate population for a particular year using projections from the Philippine Statistics Ofﬁce (PSA). If the projected estimates are not available, multiply the population based on the latest Census of Population and Housing by the growth rate. The following formula can be used: 

Estimated Population y+1= PopulationY + (Populationy * Annual Growth Rate) 

Estimated Population y+2 = Population y+1  + (Population y+1 * Annual Growth Rate) 


Total population based on 2010 Census of Population and Housing = 92,097,978 National Annual growth rate = 1.90% 

Estimated population 2011 = Population 2010 + (Population y * Annual Growth Rate) = 92,097,978 + (92,097,978 * 1.90%) = 93,847,840 Estimated population 2012 = Population 2011 + (Population 2011 * Annual Growth Rate) = 93,847,840 + (= 93,847,840 * 1.90%) = 95,630,949 

Following the same process, estimated population for Year 2015 =101,186,137 

Note: T his formula will give the same results: Populationy * (1 +Growth Rate)^Yn- Y) 

The latest NHTS-PR roster will be the basis in estimating the population of the poor. The roster will provide the actual number and age of members in a household. 

NHTS-PR Households = 5,255,094 

NHTS-PR Population = 29,842,300 

2. Compute for the number of WRA by multiplying total population with the proportion of WRA in the population. 

Based on the 2010 CPH, approximately 25.91% of the population are WRA. 

WRA2015 = Population2015 * WRA in Population 
= 101,186,137 * 25.91% 
= 26,217,328 

The NHTS-PR roster can the give actual number of WRA. Based on the latest NHTS-PR, there are 7,187,045 WRA. 

3. Estimate the number of women with unmet need for modern family planning by multiplying the proportion of women with unmet need by the estimated WRA. 

Based on the 2013 NDHS, approximately 22.5% of WRA have unmet need for modern FP. 

Unmet Need2015 = WRA2015 * Proportion of WRA with Unmet Need for modern FP = 26,217,328 * 22.5% = 5,898,899 WRA 

Unmet NeedNHTs = WRA NHTS * 22.5% = 7,187,045 * 22.5% = 1,617,085 WRA 

4. Estimate the number of women who are current users of modern family planning by multiplying the proportion of women who are current users of modern FP methods. Based on the 2013 NDHS, approximately 23.5% of WRA are current users of modern FP. 

Current Users2015 = WRA2015 * Proportion of WRA who are current users of modern FP 
=26,217,328 * 23.5% 
= 6,161,072 

Current UsersNHTs = WRANHTS * Proportion of WRA who are current users of modern FP = 7,187,045 * 23.5% = 1,688,956

B. Forecast commodity requirements using the estimated number of women with unmet need and current users of modern family planning methods for the total population and for WRA from NHTS-PR households. 

1. Determine method mix 

a. Determine ideal method mix for those with unmet need for modern FP. This can be based from the data gathered by community health volunteers, other administrative data or most ideal for province, region or country. 

b. Get the method mix of those currently using a modern FP method. This data may come administrative information gathered by health facilities or from the latest NDHS. The sample below shows the method mix from the 2013 NDHS. 

c. Current users can be inﬂuenced towards more effective or permanent methods. Determine also the ideal method mix for current users. 

d. Get the average use rates for each method by adding use rate for one method for those with unmet need and for current users and dividing the sum by two.

 Use rateMethod = USC rateUnmet Need + Use rateCurrent Users) / 2 

USC ratePills = (USC rateUnmet Need + Use rateCurrent Users) / 2 

= (32.0% + 30.0%) / 2 = 31.0% 


 <image>table_2.png</image>


2. Distribute WRA with unmet need and current users to the different FP methods FP eligible population = Unmet Need + Current Users 

Number of potential usersMethod = FP Eligible Population * Use RateMethod 

Number of potential usersPills’Total population = 12,339,604 * 31.0% = 3,825,277 

Number of potential userstssNHTs = 3,382,942 *31.0% = 1,048,712 

 
 <image>table_3.png</image>
 
 

3. Compute for total number of units required for each method by multiplying the estimated number of users with the number of units required to protect a woman or couple from getting pregnant in one year. 

Total Number of UnitsMethod = Number of Units Needed in One Year to Protect a Woman/Couple from Getting Pregnant for the method * Potential Users for the Method 

Total Number of Units pills, Total population = 15 cycles * 3,825,277 = 57,379,157 cycles 

Total Number of Units pills, NHTS = 15 cycles * 1,048,712 = 15,730,681 cycles 

  <image>table_4.png</image>


4. Compute for total cost of FP commodities by multiplying unit cost of each commodity with the total number of units required. 

Cost of CommoditiesMethod = Unit CostMethod * Total Number of Units Method 

Cost of Commodities, Total population = Php 15 * 57,379,157 = Php 1,434,478,918 

Cost of Commoditiesms, NHTS = Php 15 * 15,730,681 = Php 393,267,017
