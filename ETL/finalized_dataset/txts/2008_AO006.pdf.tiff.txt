<subject>SUBJECT: Integrating Replication Strategies in DOH Operations</subject>


<body>
I. RATIONALE

The Department of Health’s (DOH) challenge in its leadership role in the health sector, as well as in the implementation of FOURmula ONE     (F1) for Health, involves providing guidance and promoting exemplary practices in health development among a variety of organizations and through diversiﬁed processes and systems. Local Government Units (LGUs) at provincial, city, municipal, barangay and even purok levels; health centers and hospitals; private sector and civil society organizations are all part of the health service delivery system in one way or another and all contribute innovative ways of implementing health service delivery from their unique position in the system and from their own perspective. Likewise, various units of DOH, PhilHealth, and Population Commission (POPCOM) have internal practices and systems supporting the development of the health system which can be of value to others.

DOH is in a strategic position to promote and guide the replication of exemplary practices among all of these partners and structures. In the latter part of 2006, the Department began determining the modalities of integrating replication in its operations through a series of pilot activities. The Department was inspired by the Canadian International Development Agency (CIDA) supported Local Government Support Program and the Department of the Interior and Local Government’s (DILG) experience with the Governance Facility for Replication and Adaptation (GOF AR) program. The learning gained from these organizations has demonstrated that peers evolving under the same regulatory environment, with similar socio—economic settings, often face challenges of very similar nature and can, therefore, share tested solutions among one another. However, the mere presence and recognition of exemplary practices does not mean that they will automatically be mainstreamed. Despite the enthusiasm to be exposed to and learn from peers, leadership and organizational commitment are required to translate goodwill into concrete implementation. Furthermore, a process is required to facilitate the sharing of knowledge with the intention of replicating experiences and disseminating them to other peer organizations/units. The strategic selection of relevant experiences and the coordination of simple methodologies structuring the exposure and learning process, which are integral aspects of the Knowledge Management strategy adopted by DOH, can make a big difference in the dissemination of exemplary practices among peers and thus, improve the health delivery system.

The integration of replication strategies in DOH operations, therefore, supports DOH’s mandate as the technical authority on health. It particularly supports the technical assistance and capacity development advisory role that DOH plays for the stakeholders of the health sector. Furthermore, replication strategies are perceived as a strategic way of supporting the implementation of the F1 for health reform agenda. Given that Fl suggests the adoption of a series of diversiﬁed practices by various stakeholders, replication is one approach to maximize the adoption of such practices by disseminating what works well with as many relevant stakeholders as possible.

II. KEY PRINCIPLES IN REPLICATION

The Replication of Exemplary Practices in health represents one of several tools to help the department achieve the F l objectives. Replication can help capture the experiences of various stakeholders especially of the LGUs, which are relevant to others pursuing similar results and reduce the costs of maximizing and disseminating such solutions.

The adaption of replication as an implementation strategy for DOH implies the use of a common set of guidelines and methodologies to ensure consistency and effectiveness in replication and to facilitate Cooperation among various individuals and units throughout the DOH.

Replication is an effective strategy based on the following principles that serves as guideposts in ensuring the effectiveness of the replication process. Replication is essentially a capacity building initiative which provides an opportunity to learn and apply new knowledge, attitudes and skills in meeting health sector reform objectives with the following principles:

A. Seeing is believing.
Firsthand learning is one of the best ways to share and transfer knowledge and skills. Seeing it in action, talking to the people who have successfully implemented it or beneﬁted from it and ﬁnding tangible evidence of its beneﬁts are exciting, participatory ways of learning as well as powerful incentives to replicating.

B. Replicating 1s innovating.
Replicating can be a genuinely creative process. It expands one’ s vision beyond one s locality and see the situations and efforts of others. As a result, there will be a shift in perspective which will be transformed into a viable, original project that will suit the unique needs and conditions of a locality.

C. Follow the methodology.
A structured, organized process of replicating ensures the best chances of achieving results. First hand learning and innovative replication may diminish in value without the beneﬁt of an effective methodology that is properly followed by host and replicating LGUs. Work planning is a crucial part of the replication process.

D. Replicate at least possible cost and eﬂort.
Replication loses its value if it is done at great expense and effort. The underlying principle of replication is to avoid reinventing the wheel and beneﬁting from already tested solutions.

III. GOAL AND OBJECTIVES

Goal
To strengthen DOH's ability to achieve the objectives of f1 in partnership with the LGU's Civil Society Organizations and the private sector, thereby improving the health and quality of life of Filipinos throughout the country.

Specific Objectives:

1) To integrate and institutionalize replication in DOH operations as part of the Department’s sector-wide knowledge management strategy and capacity-building role;

2) To support the continuous development of DOH personnel in national and regional ofﬁces in promoting and implementing the replication of exemplary practices among its partners and within its own structure and systems,

3) To engage with partners in identifying, documenting, organizing and promoting the dissemination of successful and strategic replicable practices in support of F1;

4) To contribute to making the DOH policy and programs development process by local implementation realities through a closer rapport with LGUs and other partners/ stakeholders.



IV. SCOPE AND COVERAGE

The strategy encompasses the operations of all agencies comprising the DOH, including the Centers for Health Development (CHD) and attached agencies like the Philippine Health Insurance Corporation (PHIC), POPCOM, National Nutrition Council (NN C) Philippine Institute of Traditional and Alternative Health Care (PITAHC) and other agencies, upon concurrence by these agencies' respective governing Boards.

Through the national collaborative effort to strengthen the health system, the strategy seeks to engage health stakeholders such as LGUs at provincial, city, municipal, barangay and even purok levels; health centers and hospitals; private entities; and civil society organizations in so far as these stakeholders and partners contribute to public health and require guidance and support to maximize their contribution in quality health service delivery.

The concepts and methodologies in replication are generic in nature and can be adapted to various types of practices, i.e., an administrative procedure within a Bureau, how an LGU delivers a certain service, how a hospital manages its personnel, etc. DOH will use the approaches and methodologies to promote the replication of both internal procedures and systems and local partner practices.

There is currently great demand for local practices implemented by DOH partners, primarily Local Government Units, and this will initially represent the main area of focus for the use of replication methodologies. With time, DOH will increasingly use the replication methodologies as a tool to strengthen and disseminate internal practices and systems.

DEFINITION OF TERMS
The following are the operational deﬁnition of terms in relation to replication:

A. Exemplary Practice
A mechanism, system, process, method or set of procedures that has been proven to be an effective and efﬁcient way of addressing a particular situation, problem or challenge and which may serve as a model.

B. Host LGU
The local government unit whose exemplary practice has been selected for replication and will participate in the replication process as model to the replicating LGUs.

C. Knowledge Management
Knowledge management is a process that involves the acquisition, storage, retrieval, creation, sharing, use, application and evaluation of an organization 5 explicit and tacit knewledge in a systematic manner to achieve organizational/ sectoral goals.

D. Lakbay Aral (Study Tour)
The Lakbay Aral, which translates into “Study Tour”, oftentimes refers to less structured exposure/visit of public sector units. Lakbay Arals were popularized among LGUs when the Department of Budget and Management (DBM) and the DILG authorized the use of public funds for educational purposes and to foster the sharing of good practices in the pubic sector, particularly among LGUs. But it was later realized that given a generalized lack of structure and process as well as commitment and political will, Lakbay Arals rarely translated into concrete results

E. Peer
A person who is equal to another in some ”respect such as age, profession or social class.

F. Peer-to-Peer Learning
A learning or capacity development approach involving relationship amongst counterparts of the same professional sector.

G. Replicable Practice
An exemplary practice that can be easily replicated among peers sharing common conditions and facing similar challenges.

H. Replication
A systematic and supportive project implementation process that involves learning from and sharing with others practices that are proven and effective solutions to common and similar problems, so as to contribute to the sustainable well-being of citizens and advancement of local government with the least possible costs and efforts.

I. Replicating LGU
The local government unit adapting the identiﬁed exemplary practice.

VI. CONCEPTUAL FRAMEWORK

 <image>figure_1.png</image>

Figure 1. Replication Supporting DOH Strategic Mandate and Functions

As illustrated in the above ﬁgure, the replication of exemplary practices is a knowledge management mechanism which may be used throughout the Department and among all of the stakeholders of the health sector. As such, it supports the Department’s technical assistance and capacity development role as technical authority in the health sector. With particular emphasis on the implementation of F l, replication is used by various units of the Department to relate with stakeholders and support the dissemination of exemplary health service delivery practices. While replication is primarily an implementation strategy to foster exemplary practices, it also provides an opportunity for national bureaus, attached agencies and CHDs to better appreciate the realities of ﬁeld implementation. Replication can also enable the Department to develop or better adapt its policies and programs to local situations.

A. REPLICATION AS A STRATEGY TO STRENGTHEN DOH LEADERSHIP IN HEALTH

The DOH serves as the national technical authority on health, one that should ensure the highest achievable standards of quality health care, health promotion and health protection, from which local governments units, non-government organizations, other private organizations and individual members of civil society will anchor their health programs and strategies. This involves providing technical oversight to monitor and evaluate the implementation of health programs, projects, research, training and services; acting as an innovator of new strategies for responding to emerging health needs, and being a capacity- builder of local government units, the private sector, non-government organizations, people’s organizations, national government agencies, in implementing health programs and services.

As an innovative and effective technical assistance mechanism, replication or the peer-to-peer sharing process offers DOH a venue to provide guidance and support LGUs and other partners very practically, in a manner which is responsive and adapted to ﬁeld and implementation realities. Lessons learned from replication activities can also guide DOH Technical Assistance (TA) activities. Replication itself can be an alternative way of providing technical assistance, or replication can be a component of training activities, especially for complex practices.

B. FOURMULA ONE FOR HEALTH

Building on the experience of some 30 years of evolution in the health sector, FOURmula ONE for Health is the current implementation framework for health sector reform in the DOH. It is primarily based on lessons with respect to health reforms in several localities, the growing interest and support from external development partners, the deeper understanding of the requirements of implementing reforms, the reinforcement from partner government agencies, and the revitalized political support which emerged from reforms of national leadership.

The objectives of FOURmula ONE imply that the achievement of health care reforms and results must be based on a collaborative effort involving several stakeholders, which include the DOH Bureaus and CHDs; other partners such as PhilHealth and POPCOM  implementing systems to deliver services and engage partners, and LGUs, private sector and other civil society organizations actually delivering services at the local level. Each of these stakeholders play their respective roles and must be creative in identifying solutions and developing speciﬁc ways of achieving one or another aspect of the common goal. The policy framework of F0 URmula ONE suggests the adoption of a series of diversiﬁed practices by various stakeholders, which taken as a whole, contribute to the overall goal. Replication has the potential to maximize the adoption of such practices by disseminating what Works with as many relevant stakeholders as possible.

C. Knowledge Management for Health

Knowledge Management (KM) is a process of creating, sharing, using and evaluating knowledge to enhance organizational performance. Realizing the importance of KM, the DOH set up a KM Unit and formulated a KM Framework and Strategy. The DOH KM Framework and Strategy focuses on:

i. Developing a culture of capturing, utilizing and sharing knowledge to support work processes and systems;

ii. Connecting with networks and people who know and share knowledge and using the most appropriate technology, systems, and media.

Among the various KM initiatives that the DOH is developing in order to achieve the above objectives is the sharing of exemplary practices and innovations among health partners
Replication offers innovative methodologies and tools for structuring this sharing and learning process among stakeholders so that these are actually applied and lead to tangible results. It is a concrete application of knowledge management in which the cycle of knowledge creation, sharing and utilization is supported through the documentation of the practices, sharing of experiences through peer—to-peer learning, and actual replication of effective solutions to health service delivery challenges.

VII. OPERATIONAL FRAMEWORK

A. Identifying Exemplary Health Practices

A guide in identifying exemplary health practices of LGUs has been developed to be promoted by DOH for replication.

1. A description of the four main components of F1 (Service Delivery, Financing, Governance, and Regulation) and how these translate into systems, procedures and practices for LGUs. Practices identified following this description fall under one or more of the four components of F1. (See Annex A for sample LGU initiatives under the components of F1);

2. Criteria to help select practices that can be realistically replicated by LGUs, and other important considerations.

Selection Criteria and Other Considerations

a. LGU-initiated
The practice should be an LGU—initiated solution to problems encountered in developing local health system/implementing health reforms, targeting the vulnerable and marginalized sectors. This may also include practices that are LGU-adopted or implemented in coordination with other partners and/or stakeholders. What is important is that there is ownership by the LGU on the practice and it can be shown that the practice was initiated to address one or more health issues or concerns.

This criterion emphasizes that LGUs should be the leaders and “owners” of
the practice having been implemented primarily with own resources and initiative as opposed to having been implemented with heavy assistance from National Government Agencies (NGAS) or external agents. This is simply to ensure that an LGU or other local stakeholder wanting to replicate it is likely to share the conditions for its implementation and will not need to rely on difﬁcultly accessible external
programs, technical assistance and resources to implement it.

b. Simple and doable
The practice should be simple and doable such that it can be replicated withinone and a half years or less. Complex practices that take a longer period to replicate, i.e., three years, may also be considered but these may require additional support or other approaches to be applied. A component of a complex practice may also be replicated.

The use of replication methodologies among peers is best used for practices which are not too complex and can, therefore, be replicated relatively easily by peers sharing similar conditions. Where complex practices are proposed for replication and dissemination, more signiﬁcant technical assistance beyond peer—to-peer support
might be required. It is also easier for an LGU to keep the momentum going for a project implemented in a shorter timeframe rather than one that drags on over a longer period with added road blocks and difﬁculties lessening the potential for its actual completion.

c. High level of sustainability
The practice should demonstrate a high level of sustainability. The following indicators may help determine the level of sustainability of a practice:
i. consistent with existing health policies;
ii. supported by local governance/resolutiens/integrated in LGU investment plan,
iii. had been in place for more than three years;
iv. widely participated and supported by the communities, the legislative and the executives are involved and supportive of it;
v. has been adopted as a permanent structure or program with regular budgetary support; and
vi. there is community representation in decision-making bodies and committees.

d. Cost effective and cost efﬁcient
The exemplary practice does not require huge amounts of resources to
replicate. It is a “common sense” idea, as opposed to a capital-intensive project. Some examples that illustrate cost effectiveness and efﬁciency are:
i. mobilization and utilization of indigenous resources; and
ii. minimal support from external sources.

e. Positive results on the beneﬁciaries and communities

The exemplary practice has proven to be an effective response to the
identiﬁed needs of its target beneﬁciaries. It has also signiﬁcantly contributed to improving the health conditions of the beneﬁciaries. Beneﬁciaries should be the vulnerable, disadvantaged, marginalized sectors.

Examples of results:
i. improved health service coverage
ii. 100% indigency coverage
iii. client satisfaction
iv. accessible quality medical care to beneﬁciaries and communities

Other factors important to consider in selecting exemplary health practices forreplication:
i. Does the practice help achieve Fl objectives? Is it in line with the thrusts orpriorities of the Department?
ii. Is the Host LGU willing to share its practice to others?
iii. Is there a demand for this practice? What common activities do Fl provinceswant to implement? Will many. LGUs want/need to replicate this practice?

B. Replication Components/Activities

Implementing the replication of exemplary health practices among LGUs is divided into four main components/activities:

1. Identifying, Selecting and Documenting Exemplary Practices
Exemplary practices for replication should be strategically selected and
effectively documented. The framework that has been developed to guide the identiﬁcation of exemplary health practices of LGUs shall be applied in the selection 4 process. The documentation will be implemented by various divisions of the Department and will follow a set of common guidelines in order for the Department to have consistency in the presentation of its exemplary practices.

The identiﬁcation, selection and documentation of practices will be done through an annual call for practices within the Department. The evaluation and approval for both the selection and ﬁnal documentation of exemplary practices shall be at the Central Ofﬁce level.

2. Engaging Host LG Us in Eﬂectively Sharing their Success

Replication is primarily a peer—to—peer exchange process. Host LGUs that have implemented successful practices can play a strategic role in helping peers appreciate their experience and be in a position to replicate it. The DOH needs to engage the Host LGUS and other organizations as partners in replication. They must work together to make the exemplary practices known and to ensure that they are shared effectively. The DOH will provide technical assistance to the hosts in sharing their practices and experiences as needed.

3. Promoting the Practices and Encouraging Replication

Once the exemplary practices have been selected and documented, the DOH will promote them for replication in various ways. This includes: posting practices on a web site; integrating exemplary practices in training and capacity development activities; encouraging international development partners to support replication activities, promoting them through various publications; connecting replicating LGUs with relevant hosts, etc. Only documented practices that have been evaluated and approved at Central Ofﬁce level can be shared and promoted to others.

4. Supporting Actual Replication among LG Us

The actual replication among LGUs can gain by being supported by the DOH from a process point of view. The DOH will provide technical assistance to help the hosts prepare for inception workshops (exposure visits); conduct the werkshops; and monitor the progress of replication in the replicating LGUs.

C. Replication Tools and References

A Manual of Operations for Replication of Exemplary Health Practices Among Local Government Units containing replication tools and references shall be adopted by all DOH units (bureaus, CHDs and attached agencies) implementing replication activities. Given that DOH is still at its initial stages of integrating replication into its operations and structures, the tools and references will continue to develop as the strategy evolves.

D. Budgetary Support

All ofﬁces and bureaus comprising the Department of Health, including the Centers for Health Development and attached agencies like the Philippine Health Insurance Corporation and the Commission on Population, should allocate budget for replication activities in their respective Annual Work and Financial Plans.

VIII. IMPLEMENTING MECHANISMS

The DOH recognizes that the integration of replication into the Department’s operations is an incremental and iterative process. A pilot phase allowing selected units of the Department to experiment with concepts and methodologies since June 2006 has provided the foundation to continue spreading the strategies into the Department’s operations.

The approaches will be gradually phased in accordance to the response of the various stakeholders and the relative appropriateness of the replication approaches for their respective
functions and mandates.

Roles and Responsibilities of DOH Units and Partner LGUs

Through the knowledge management process of identifying, documenting, promoting and facilitating the sharing of exemplary practices, various units of national bureaus, CHDs, etc. take part in replication in both a policy and program capacity. This includes speciﬁc roles and responsibilities of ofﬁces, bureaus, agencies, committees and LGU partners in the implementation of replication methodologies both at the national and regional/local levels. Further, at least two representatives shall be identiﬁed from the member ofﬁces/agencies of the Steering Committee.

The adaption/application of the Replication strategy shall be managed and
functionally organized as shown in Figure 2.
