<doctype>ADMINISTRATIVE ORDER</doctype>
<subject>SUBJECT: Adoption of the Revised DOH Code of Conduct</subject>

<body>
I. BACKGROUND 

The Code of conduct is an essential component in ensuring efﬁciency, transparency and accountability in the government service. Its primary objective is to establish the Agency’s own standards of behavior in the exercise of ofﬁcial functions. It also clariﬁes and reinforces legal stipulations on unethical behavior and corrupt practices, hence is helpful in managing the ﬁght against corruption. 

The development and implementation of the Code of Conduct is part of the Integrity Development Action Plan (IDAP) a major initiative of the Presidential Anti- Graﬁ Commission (PAGC) in partnership with national government agencies (including the Department of Health), bureaus and regional ofﬁces. Formulation and adoption of an Agency-speciﬁc Code of Conduct is part of the ten (10) IDAP deliverables. 

Although DOH ofﬁcials and employees abide by the provisions of the Civil Service Commission (CSC) Law & Rules and other applicable laws on personnel/administrative issues, it was only in the late 2006 and onwards that the management began drafting the DOH customized Code of Conduct not only as compliance with PAGC directives but also to craft a tool or mechanism in ﬁghting corruption and strengthen the culture of integrity among its’ workforce. 

Several policies were formulated and implemented through the issuance of Administrative Orders (AOs), Department Orders (DOS), Department Memorandums (DMs), etc. A Project Team was created to review and consolidate these issuances into one (1) DOH customized Code of Conduct and to harmonize the provisions in accordance with existing CSC Law & Rules and other related laws. 

II. OBJECTIVES 

1. To set the guidelines and parameters for the DOH ofﬁcials and employees in the conduct of their functions as civil servants. 

2. To serve as deterrent against corruption and other malpractices in the government service. 

3. To specify the applicable administrative penalty for any violation of the DOH Code of Conduct. 

4. To establish a system of incentives and rewards for exemplary conduct and/or practices. 


III. APPLICABILITY 

The DOH Code of conduct shall apply to all DOH permanent and contractual ofﬁcials and employees in the Central Ofﬁce, Centers for Health Development, Specialty and Retained Hospitals, attached Ofﬁces/Units and Bureaus. It also includes non-plantilla contractual employees and consultants who report within the DOH’s regular working hours. 

IV. POLICIES & GUIDELINES 

The speciﬁc policies and guidelines are contained in the Handbook accompanying this Administrative Order and is made an integral part hereof. 

V. RESPONSIBILITY 

It is the responsibility of the Head of Agency or his/her authorized ofﬁcial to regularly review and update the provisions of this Code of Conduct and to ensure compliance of all ofﬁcials and employees. 

It is the responsibility of the Head of Health Human Resource Development Bureau particularly the Training Division to orient the workforce especially newly- hired employees. Each employee shall be furnished a copy of this Code for their guidance. 

VI.REPEALING CLAUSE 

All DOH issuances relative to the Code of Conduct and other related issuances including those herein included/incorporated and not consistent with this Administrative Order are hereby repealed, amended and modiﬁed accordingly. 

VII. EFFECTIVITY

RULE VII 
ENCOURAGING REPORTING OF MALPRACTICES, CORRUPTION AND OTHER PROTECTED DISCLOSURES 

The lack of a legal framework for giving incentives, awards and protection to whistleblowers/informers has resulted in minimal protection to the whistleblower/informer and his family from possible retaliation or an outright miscarriage of justice. Moreover, the strong societal pressure from the possible stigma that may attach to a whistleblower/informant caused by divulging information detrimental to a colleague more often than not outweighs any motivation to speak up. 

This being the case, corrupt government ofﬁcials and employees are emboldened to continue their unlawful activities without fear of exposure. At the same time, the potential whistleblower are discouraged and de-motivated because they anticipate nothing else but further hardship if ever they evaluate the effects of any act of disclosure. 

This Rule will set up a mechanism speciﬁcally by l) ensuring that public disclosures are made to the proper public entity; 2) ensuring that the inappropriate publication of unsubstantiated disclosures does not damage the reputation of the whistleblowers/informers; 3) ensuring that proper records and disclosures are kept; 4) that all whistleblowers emanating from C0, CHDs, attached agencies, hospitals, and Rehabilitation Centers shall be within the original jurisdiction of the DOH Central Ofﬁce. 

Section 1.

(a) Republic Act No. 3019 
(b) Republic Act No. 1379 
(c) Republic Act No. 6713 
(d) Republic Act No. 7080 
(e) Presidential Decree No. 46, and 
(f) Titles 11 and III of the Book Two of the Revised Penal Code. 

Section 2. WHO CONSTITUTES WHISTLEBLOWERS — the following persons shall be considered to be “whistleblowers”, and thus qualiﬁed to enjoy the rights, privileges and incentives outlined in these rules: 

(1) Employee/personnel of the Department, or any of its attached agencies, hospitals, specialty centers, occupying a regular plantilla or contractual position, at the time of the complaint;
