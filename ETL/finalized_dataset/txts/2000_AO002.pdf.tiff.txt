<subject>SUBJECT: Implementing Guidelines for Strengthening the Training in Minilaparotomy Under Local Anesthesia for Resident Physicians in OB - Gyne in all DOH Retained Hospitals and Medical Centers.</subject>

<body>

I. Background and Rationale:

The goal of the Department at Health's Family Planning Program is to ensure the universal availability of all Family Planning (FP) methods to all Filipino men and women. Voluntary Sterilization (VS), which includes Bilateral Tubal Ligation (BTL) for women and Vasectomy for men are permanent FP methods that are recognized as highly effective FP methods.

The standard technique for Bilateral Tubal Ligation (BTL) that has been recognized by the DOH is Minilaparotomy under Local Anesthesia (ML-LA). This has been incorporated in the clinical standards for the Department of Health Family Planning Program. The use of local anesthesia makes the method more accessible and available to a greater number of potential BTL clients. The advantage of this technique include lesser risks and complications, lesser cost, lesser duration of hospitalization, procedure can he performed where there are no anesthesiologists, therefore enabling the procedure in the hospitals in rural and far flung areas.

A Consultative meeting convened in October 1999 attended by chief of hospitals and OB department heads resulted in an agreement to strengthen the training of resident physicians in Minilaparotomy under local anesthesia. The goal of such is to ensure that there would be a greater number of physicians who are able to provide quality BTL services using the standard technique.

This order provides guidelines that performance of BTL procedures using minilaparotomy under local anesthesia shall be incorporated in the residency training curriculum.

Guidelines:

Minilap under local anesthesia shall be included in the residency training program.
a) First year residency:
1. first six (6) months, OB—Gyne residents shall assist in minilap under local anesthesia.
2. last six (6) months of the year, shall perform supervision.
3. should be able to perform 10 case of minilap under supervision.
b) Second year residency:
1. residents shall perform minilap without supervision.
2. residents shall be required to perform a minimum of 40 cases of BTL using minilap under local anesthesia during the residency program.


III. Conduct of training:

1. There are trained VS providers in all DOH retained hospitals and medical centers hence these VS providers (usually OB phycisians) will be responsible in transferring the technology to the resident physicians in their respective hospitals.
2. All OB—Gyne residents will be trained on Minilap under local anesthesia.
3. Each DOH—retained hospital/medical center shall ensure the availability trainers for ML-LA in their institution.
4. In cases where trainers are not available, the DOH in coordination with the accredited VS training centers and AVSC International shall train trainers from the OB—Gyne department to become certified trainers in ML-LA. This will be done through the conduct of on-site training of trainers at the requesting DOH—retained hospital/medical center.
5. There are three VS training centers in the Philippines:
a. Cagayan Valley Regional Hospital
h. Jose Fabella Memorial Hospital
c. Regin I Medical Center 
6. Conduct of refresher courses in ML-LA can be done in DOH VS training centers. 

This order shall take effect immediately.
