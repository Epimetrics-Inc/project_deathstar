<subject>SUBJECT: Guidelines in the Provision of the Essential Health Service Packages in Emergencies and Disasters </subject>


<body>
I. BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE 

Republic Act. No. 10121 or the Philippine Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Act of 2010 (DRRM Act) defines the National Disaster Response Plan (NDRP) and mandated the Department of Health (DOH) as member of the Council to manage the health consequences of disasters through the provision of health services. Based on this mandate the DOH has ‘_deve10ped the National DRRP for Health and capacitated all the regional ofﬁces. It was during the onslaught of the super typhoon Yolanda that this plan was tested. The DOH led the Health. Cluster in the provision of essential services for its four sub-clusters namely medical and public health, water and sanitation hygiene, nutrition in emergencies, and mental health and psychosocial support. 

However, despite the concerted efforts for a multisectoral response several post-Yolanda evaluation workshops and reports found gaps in the capacity and capability of the government, including the health system. There are identified areas without clear policies, guidelines, and standards that caused ineffective policy implementation and weak coordinating mechanisms. Hence, there is a need to formalize the guidelines in the provision of the essential service packages for the four sub-cluster through this Order to set standards in the delivery of health services for emergencies in disasters to be reinforced and complied by all implementing agenmes. 

II. OBJECTIVES

Specifically: 

a. Set guidelines in the delivery of essential health services in emergencies and disasters. 

b. Deﬁne the essential service components for health, nutrition, water and sanitation hygiene, and mental health and psychosocial support that need to be available and accessible before, during, and after emergencies and disasters.  

c. Delineate the roles and responsibilities of concerned ofﬁces, stakeholders, and partners in the delivery of essential health service packages.

IV. GENERAL GUIDELINES 

1. The EHSP shall be implemented in all humanitarian crises guided by the principles of humanity, neutrality and impartiality and likewise implemented at the onset of an emergency or disaster and shall continue until restoration of the regular health services.
