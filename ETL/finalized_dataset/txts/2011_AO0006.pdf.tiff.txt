<subject>Subject: Framework on Health Sector Response to Terrorism </subject>


<body>
I. RATIONALE 

Since a decade ago, there had been a growing shift of conventional wisdom from terrorism being a benign threat to one that can seriously undermine the safety and security of our people. The events of 9/11 in the United States and the string of bombing incidents in the country——2000 Rizal Day bombing, 2002 Zamboanga bombing, 2004 SuperFerry 14 bombing and many others—resulted in many casualties and deaths. The presence of other factors such as social instability, poverty and increasing grievance among the rogue elements of the society could perpetuate terrorism locally. 

Terrorism constitutes a grave danger to public safety since possible targets can be communities, institutions, the society or even individuals. Terrorism can be manifested as ﬁre, explosion, collision, shipwreck, air/road crash that can lead to collapse of lifelines and structures, and the direct or indirect release of chemical, biological, radiological, nuclear, and explosives (CBRNE) agents that lead to specific mortality and morbidity. 

Republic Act 9372 or the Human Security Act of 2007, otherwise known as the “anti- terrorism law” provides the legal framework for the country’s efforts at combating terrorism. It created the Anti-Terrorism Council (ATC) which formulated the National Anti-Terrorism Strategy (N ATS) which is guided by the concepts of comprehensiveness and collaboration so that all of the efforts are to the best interest of the public. The Department of Health was designated by the ATC as one of the lead agencies to counter terrorism, especially for biological incidents. Nonetheless, its role in the consequence management of the effects of terrorism, whether chemical, biological, radiological, nuclear and explosives-induced is very essential. It has the inherent capability to manage and/or minimize the impact of such incidents by improving the capabilities to deal with the aftermath, coordination of response and care of the victims. The ﬂuid, complex, multifaceted and challenging realm of terrorism would certainly require close coordination and collaboration among DOH offices, Centers for Health Development, local government units, public and private hospitals, other DOH attached agencies, other members of the health sector, other government and non-government agencies if an effective public health response to terrorism is to be achieved. This Order is hereby issued to clarify the responsibilities and roles of the health sector in counter-terrorism. 


II. OBJECTIVES 

This Order shall set the guidelines for the health sector response to reduce the risk of morbidity and mortality resulting from terroristic threats and acts. 

III. SCOPE AND COVERAGE 

This Order covers DOH Offices, Bureaus and National Centers, Centers for Health Development, DOH Hospitals, Local Government Units, Private Hospitals, other members of the Health Sector, and other government agencies involved in effective counter-terrorism response. 

IV. DEFINITION OF TERMS/ACRONYMS

CBRNE — chemical, biological, radiological, nuclear, and explosives. 

Consequence Management - actions to counter effects of terrorist attacks using either conventional explosives, or chemical, biological, radiological, or nuclear weapons. 

Epizoonoses -—- diseases communicable from animals to humans under natural conditions which can affect or has the tendency to affect large numbers of individuals within a population, community or region at the same time. 

Terrorism -- is any act that is often considered to be deliberate violence, or the threat of violence directed at innocent non-combatants and governments to cause fear to attract attention for political, ideological, and religious causes, often in a coercive manner. 

Weapons of Mass Destruction (WMD) — any weapon or device that is intended, or has the capacity, to cause death or serious bodily injury to a significant number of people through the release or dissemination, or impact of toxic or poisonous chemicals or their precursors, a disease organism, or radiation or radioactivity. 

V. PUBLIC HEALTH AND TERRORISM FRAMEWORKS 

Responding to CBRNE attacks is a multidisciplinary and complex task. With many issues and questions, a means of organizing and prioritizing strategic approaches to response is needed. This can be addressed using the risk management approach. Terrorist attacks employing the agents may result in health consequences that can give rise to specific morbidity and mortality, injuries and trauma. For this, the health sector bears the responsibility of acting on these through risk reduction by decreasing the vulnerability of people to these attacks, lessening the impact of these attacks through proper consequence management and increasing the capacity of the health sector to prevent, prepare for and respond to CBRNE incidents.

Health Sector responsibility for terrorism can be laid out in a continuum covering the following: a.) Ensuring access to health investment in social services to counter terrorist risks; b.) Pre-hospital and mass casualty management to address direct and indirect voluntary injuries, other indirect mortality and morbidity due to terrorist events; 0.) Epidemiological and clinical management of speciﬁc risks, outbreaks and casualties due to direct or indirect release of CBRNE agents causing epidemics, epizoonoses and environmental pollution; d.) Epidemiological evidence, education and advocacy against weapons of mass destruction; e.) Risk communication for targets of terrorism. 

To align the strategic approach with the terrorist-based crisis management model, there are four (4) phases to be considered: Predict, Prevent, Prepare, and Perform. The prediction phase is through intelligence information coming from national security agencies and other stakeholders. An important source of report of CBRNE attacks is from surveillance mechanisms that are in place. Prevention strategies are in the context of ensuring laboratory safety and security, promoting occupational health and safety, environmental monitoring and regulation, to avert intentional release of CBRNE agents and to prevent risk exposure by enhancing public awareness. These two (2) phases comprise the adjustment stage during which time the threat of CBRNE attack has not materialized yet but there' 15 high probability of occurrence. 

Preparedness phase sets in through formulation of policies, plans and programs for CBRNE, as well as capacity building through training. Physical facility enhancement by upgrading facilities and equipments also plays an important role. Networking arrangements with other agencies for preparedness and response as well as the conduct of regular drills are also contributory to preparedness initiatives. This also coincides with the readiness stage wherein the health sector is now poised to respond. 

Performance phase represents the action stage in which the entire health sector responsibility for CBRNE consequence management is fulfilled. This can be in the form of pre-hospital care (triage, treatment, transport), mass casualty management, hospital care, speciﬁc treatment and even rehabilitation. Continuing epidemic investigation and risk communications are also warranted. Results and ﬁndings of post-action activities are fed back to the system to ensure that the health system can adjust again and be prepared for any new threat. 

VI. GENERAL GUIDELINES 

The Department of Health (DOH) shall lead the health sector through its technical expertise, resource mobilization capabilities and exemplary governance in carrying out the health sector role for an effective terrorist response. It shall lead the health sector in the: 

A. Prevention of terroristic acts by active surveillance and by preventing exposure of people to CBRNE agents in partnership with other sectors. 

B. Preparation against terroristic acts by issuing policies, formulating programs and plans related to terrorism, and undertaking training, capability building, systems upgrading, simulation exercises and drills and networking, and providing logistics support. 

C. Mitigation of impact of terroristic acts by consequence management and control of CBRNE exposure and preventing further spread to others. 

D. Improvement and updating of its response to reduce the risk of morbidity and mortality resulting from terroristic threats and acts. 

E. Effort towards recovery from destructions caused by the terroristic acts. 

These guidelines shall be integrated into the overall disaster preparedness plans of DOH CO, CHDs, DOH-retained, LGU, and private hospitals. 

VII. SPECIFIC GUIDELINES
