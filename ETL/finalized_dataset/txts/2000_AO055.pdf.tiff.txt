<subject>SUBJECT: GUIDELINES IN THE IMPLEMENTATION OF MASS TREATMENT STRATEGY FOR SCHISTOSOMIASIS CONTROL / ELIMINATION</subject>

<body>

The Philippines is one of the world’s important endemic countries for schistosomiasis. The disease occurs in 10 regions, 25 provinces, 183 municipalities and 1112 barangays in the country with an estimated total endemic population at 1.8 million.

Schistosomiasis has remained a public health problem for almost 6 decades since the occurrence of an epidemic in 1994, among American and Allied Forces that landed in Leyte. With the present national health directional goal towards disease elimination, the Schistosomiasis Control Program of the Department of Health should implement a more aggressive strategy to attain this end (prevalence rate of less than 1%). Hence, Mass Drug Administration or Mass Treatment Strategy shall be implemented in all schistosomiasis endemic areas. 

In coordination with the least Government Units, the Regional and Provincial Schistosomiasis Coordinators; the Provincial Based Schistosomiasis Control Teams and the National Center for Infectious Diseases shall cooperate with each other in planning and conducting the activities on schistosomiasis mass treatment strategy for the attainment of the schistosomiasis control program goal and objectives.


I. STRATEGIES/ACTIVITIES

1.1 To generate active support encourage collaborative effort in the control /elimination of schistosomiasis, inter-sectoral coordination shall be carried out thru advocacy meetings with local government executives; school officials and teachers, various social, political and business groups; and other government and non government organisations.

1.2 Continuous IEC activities as well as development and provision of IEC materials shall be implemented to sustain the community‘s level of awareness.

1.3 Orientation and skills development training shall be conducted for service providers who will be involved in the mass chemotherapy program.

1.6 The local government units shall be encouraged to adopt and integrate the schistosomiasis mass treatment strategy into their local health program for sustainability.


2. MASS TREATMENT (Mass Drug Administration)

2.1 Mass treatment (treatment with the benefit of stool examination) shall be implemented country wide in all schistosomiasis endemic barangays and the population to be covered will be ages 5 years old and above.

2.2 Praziquantel (generic name) the drug to be used for schistosomiasis mass treatment, will be given at 40-50 mg/kg body weight and shall
be taken with filled stomach or after ingestion of food.

2.3 For individuals having body weight of 31 kgs. and above, praziquantel will be applied in single dose while those with less than 31 kgs. body weight, the drug will be given in 2 divided doses (split dose) at 4-6 hours interval.

2.4 Treated individuals shall be observed for a few hours for possible side reaction, before allowing to leave the designated treatment centers

2.5 Anti-reaction drugs must be readily available during mass treatment. Individuals with generally poor condition shall be given supportive drugs such as Vitamins and hemanitics.

2.6 Those with history of epileptic seizure, with high blood pressure as well as with enlarge spleen or in the advance stage should be referred to the hospital for treatment.

2.7 Although praziquantel has not shown to be mutagenic, teratogenic or embryotoxic, administration of drug is not recommended for pregnant women unless immediate intervention is essential. Nursing mothers on the other hand shall not breastfeed their babies for 28  hours after praziquantel treatment.

2.8 Rural Health Physician shall be encouraged in the supervision/administration of treatment during the scheduled mass treatment.

3.2 Whenever resources is available, application of molluscicide will be done by the schistosomiasis control teams in collaboration with the community concerned in areas where eradication of snails (O. hupensis quadrasi) is possible and where disease transmission is relatively high.


H. MONITORING / EVALUATION AND SURVEILLANCE SYSTEM

1. In order to adequately assess the effect of mass treatment and guide public health for future action, monitoring / evaluation and surveillance system shall be developed.

2. Since it is not feasible to cover the entire endemic population sentinel sites for surveillance and monitoring shall be established / identified in every endemic province.

3. Well defined common indicators (e.g. prevalence, incidence, egg output per gram, snail infection rate, etc.) and comparable procedure for data collection system shall be developed, so that effect/impact of mass treatment strategy can be drawn.

4. Masterlist of the endemic population per barangay shall be established and maintained.

5. Mass treatment service statistics shall be recorded and maintained by the schistosomiasis control teams and rural health units and shall he consolidated by the regional health offices.
