I. BACKGROUND/RATIONALE 

Neglected Tropical Diseases or NTDs refer to a group of parasitic, bacterial and viral infections that primarily affect about a billion people living in the most impoverished, ' vulnerable, and low income communities in tropical and subtropical countries. These NTDs 

not only infect millions of people, but also pose a threat to the educational and socio— ~ economic conditions of an endemic country and may result to disabilities & even death. Philippines, unfortunately, is one of the countries that harbour these infections wherein one of the most prevalent neglected tropical disease is soil-transmitted helminthiasis (STH). 

Soil—transmitted helminthiasis (STH) can cause poor physical growth, poor intellectual development, and impaired cognitive functions in children andcan result to anemia and malnutrition not only on children but also in women of child bearing age. The highest intensity of infection has been documented among children aged 1 to 12 years old. Pre- school aged children (1-4 years old) suffer the greatest morbidity, while school aged children (5- 12 years old) harbour the greatest load of infection. 

STH affects all 81 provinces in the Country with baseline data of 65% among the 6 to 14 years old (UP-CPH, 2003) while prevalence rate of 66% among children agedl to 5 years old (DOH, UNICEF and UP-CPH, 2004). Given the relatively high prevalence of STH infections among children in the country, the Integrated Helminth Control" Program (IHCP) was established by the Department of Health to implement deworming, together with WASH (Water, Sanitation and Hygiene), behavior change and advocacy interventions. 

WHO documents based on several studies have shown the detrimental effects of STH on the educational performance and school attendance of children but noted signiﬁcant improvements in language and memory development following treatment. Therefore, mass deworming is being utilized by the government as one of the major strategies to reduce the burden of helminth infections among children aged 1 to 12 years old. The drug of choice for deworming is either Albendazole 400 mg or Mebendazole 500 mg, administered as single dose twice a year during the scheduled deworming months of April and October for 1-4 years old, and July of the current year then January of the succeeding year for 5-12 years old. Both drugs are known to have excellent safety records with only minimal and transient adverse reactions. These drugs are inexpensive and effective making regular deworming of Filipino children both affordable and sustainable. 

Reduction in STH prevalence has been observed in the regions after several years of deworming based on the partial results of the National Parasite Survey (2013) done by the Research Institute for Tropical Medicine. The preliminary results showed 12—3 8% today, a ﬁgure that is lower compared to the baseline data. Furthermore, pilot projects in Regions 6 and 11 (with MDA Coverage in 2014 in both regions of 89%) have proven that single day deworming is feasible and that it improves the efﬁciency of service delivery among the target population. - 

Deworming children in schools has been found to be a good strategy to reduce the burden of STH infections with a positive impact on children’s education and health, provided that the desired MDA coverage of at least 85% is achieved. Thus, in order to ﬁlrther beneﬁt from the positive effects of deworming, the National School Deworming Day (NSDD) was designed to scale-up efforts in improving health care service delivery for all school-aged children enrolled in public elementary schools. This will serve as a prelude to the 2016 Harmonized Schedule and Integrated Mass Drug Administration (HSIMDA) for the prevention, control and treatment of lymphatic ﬁlariasis, schistosomiasis and soil— transmitted helminthiasis. It is anticipated that the NSDD strategy will have a major impact on the recording and reporting of IHCP accomplishments. Results and experiences of the NSDD will help in the implementation of HSIMDA next year. Other interventions, such as WASH, however will continue to be advocated. 

II. OBJECTIVE 

General: 

To deworm approximately 16 million school-aged children enrolled in 38,659 public elementary schools in one (1) day through the National School Deworming Day initiative. 

Speciﬁc: 

1. To increase and scale-up the MDA coverage for school-aged children (5-12 years old or Kindergarten to Grade VI) enrolled in public elementary schools 

2. To facilitate and ensure timely reporting of deworming intervention 

3. To promote partnership in all levels in the implementation of deworming for school- aged children enrolled in public elementary schools 

III. SCOPE AND COVERAGE 

The NSDD is a nationwide effort targeting all 5 to 12 years old (Kindergarten to Grade VI) children enrolled in public elementary schools. School-aged children enrolled in private schools and children who are not enrolled are encouraged to participate. They can inform the DepEd Regional Ofﬁce regarding their willingness to participate and in turn, the DepEd Regional Office can refer them to the DOH Regional Ofﬁce. 


IV. DEFINITION OF TERNIS 

1. Albendazole—the drug of choice for the control, prevention, and treatment of helminth infections. 

2. Deworming—the administration of albendazole (or mebendazole), without prior diagnosis of current infection, to control and treat intestinal helminth infections such as hookworm, Ascaris, and T richurz's. 

3. Eligible Population—«a group of individuals qualiﬁed for deworming; Speciﬁcally, these are all children from 1 to 12 years old. However, for the purpose of NSDD, the target population of the single day deworming will be all children aged 5 — 12 years old or Kindergarten to Grade VI enrolled in public elementary schools. 

4. Endemic-refers to the constant presence of a disease within a given geographic area. 

5. Mass Drug Administration—a strategy to provide deworming drugs to the eligible population without the requirement of prior diagnosis of current infection. 

6. Mass Drug Administration Provider—a person who administers the deworming drugs. This can be any teacher supervised by a health worker from the Department of Health, Department of Education, Local Government Units, or volunteer groups (with prior approval from the DOH Regional - Ofﬁce) who have the capacity and background in health, administration of deworming drugs, and management of adverse events. 

7. School-age children—deﬁned as children between 5 and 12 years of age who are enrolled in school. 

8. Soil-transmitted helminthiasis — an infection caused by nematodes or a sub-group within the group of helminth infections (species). It is caused speciﬁcally by helminths transmitted through soil contaminated with fecal matter, and are therefore called soil- transmitted helminths. The main species that infect people are the roundworm (Ascar’is lumbricoides), the whipworm (Trichurz's trichiura) and the hookworms (Necator americanus and Anqylostoma duodenale). 

9. Records—refers to the NSDD forms used for reﬂecting the deworming accomplishment. 

10. Reports—an account given of a particular matter, especially in the form of an ofﬁcial document, after thorough investigation or consideration by the DOH. and DepEd Regional Ofﬁces. 

11. Evaluation-«a systematic assessment of the outcomes and impact of the NSDD campaign.

ii. RCA shall be conducted during and the week after NSDD. The objective is to measure the performance of every school, speciﬁcally to: (1) compare the total number of enrolled school-aged children and unenrolled school-aged children, (2) identify schools where there are missed school- aged children, (3) take immediate action to deworm missed school children. This should include data source. 

iii. The Regional, Provincial, Municipal, and City Health Ofﬁce teams shall perform the monitoring. Monitoring shall be done during the NSDD from the start of deworming until the preparation and submission of reports 

iv. The following procedures shall be observed in monitoring: 

- Assign monitoring teams per school division. Schedule the time and route of the teams per school. Ensure the presence of at least 1 MDAP Team per school. 

- Check the trend of the MDA coverage at 1.2 00 NN and before the cut—off of the NSDD at 4:00 o clock PM. 

- If there is a missed child, immediately communicate with the school principal to inform immediately the class adviser/teacher—in—charge and gather information and reason behind the missed deworming. 

- If the missed child did not actually get dewormed, he/ she is considered true missed child and must be dewormed immediately. 

v. SAEs shall also be monitored. Proper management and immediate referral to a hospital shall be carried out by the MDAP point person at the different levels. There are number of SAEs: (1) those caused by the drugs themselves. e. g., an allergic reaction to the drugs; (2) those caused by the parasites degeneration when they are killed: e.g., intestinal Blockage. 

c. Evaluation 

i. Evaluation of NSDD shall be done and analyzed by the DOH and DepEd Regional Ofﬁces and DOH IHCP Team. 

ii. The evaluation—shall be done according to the following indicators: 

Expected output described as:
