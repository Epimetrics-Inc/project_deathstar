</subject>
<body>


I BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE 

The National Policy on Strengthening the Prevention and Control of Chronic Lifestyle Related Non Communicable Diseases (Administrative Order No. 2011—0003 dated April 14 2011) prescribes the strategy or comprehensive approach the country has adopted in reducing the morbidity, mortality and disability rates .due to chronic lifestyle-related non communicable diseases (NCDS). The policy also clearly deﬁnes the Action Framework for the Prevention and Control of the NCDS which cOnSists of areas for intervention at three levels, i.e. environmental, lifestyle and clinical. To support the changes in these three levels of interventions, additional actions Should be instituted in the areas .of: 1-) advocacy; 2) - research, surveillance, monitoring and evaluation; 3) networking and coalition building across all sectors of the government and SOCiety, and 4) health system strengthening through primary health care to make it more responsive to chronic care. Moreover, service packages for clinical interventions of diabetes, cardioVascular diseases, cancers and chronic respiratory diseases must be provided in these settings.  

Currently, the main focus of clinical health care for NCDS in the Philippines is hospital-centered acute care. Patients with NCDS usually seek treatment at the hospitals when cardiovascular disease, cancer, diabetes and chronic respiratory disease have reached the point of acute events or long-term complications. This is a very expensive approach that will not contribute to a signiﬁcant reduction .of the NCD burden. It also denies people the health beneﬁts of taking care of their conditions at an early stage. A strategic objective in the ﬁght against the NCD epidemic is the early detection and care using cost-effective and sustainable health-care interventions that are integrated in the primary health care facilities Such as barangay health stations, rural health units, community health centers and the like. 

The World Health Organization has endorsed a set of low-cost individual treatment - protocol consisting of early screening and timely treatment in a primary health care setting (WHO PEN, Geneva 2010). The approach involves the financing and the strengthening of health care in order to improve access by high-risk individuals and by people with NCDS to essential technologies and medicines. These set of interventions are cost effective especially when compared to costly procedures that maybe necessary when detection and treatment are late and the patient reaches advanced stages of the disease. 

 
In consideration of the commitment to a 2% yearly reduction in mortality due to NCDS in the country and to contribute to the global reduction of 25% by 2025, the Philippines adapted the WHO PEN. It shall be called the Philippine Package of Essential Noncommunicable Disease Interventions (Phil PEN)- The -prOtocol for the Integrated Management-of Hypertension and-Diabetes (APPENDIX .1) will'be institutionalized in primary health care settings all over the country.

II POLICY STATEMENT 

The provision of quality clinical interventions and services for lifestyle related non- communicable diseases in the country folloWs the policy statements espoused by the National Policy on Strengthening the Prevention and Control Of- Chronic Lifestyle Related Non Communicable Diseases (Administrative Order No. 2011—0003 dated April 14, 2011). 

This states that the country shall adopt an integrated, comprehensive-and community ' based response for the prevention and control of chronic, and lifestyle related NCDS, intensifying health promotion strategies to effect changes in lifestyle, environmental Support and delivery of health care services while fostering complementary accountabilities Of all stakeholders. 

III GOAL AND OBJECTIVES 

This policy and guide aims to ensure the appropriate provision: of quality clinical interventions and services for lifestyle-related NCDS in-the country: Speciﬁcally, it aims to: 

1. Guide health Workers and; prOviders at primary health care facilities in implementing the Phil PEN to identiﬁed populatiOn groups and client needs 

2. Deﬁne the roles and responsibilities of the different DOH ofﬁces, the Philippine Health Insurance Corporation, theLGUS and other agencies in the implementation of the Phil PEN, including higher level referral facilities. 

3. Generate the support of various stakeholders in implementing the Phil PEN policy and guidelines in the country.  

IV SCOPE AND COVERAGE 

This policy applies to all-units and instrumentalities including attached agencies of the DOH and local government units (LGUs). It also applies to non-government organizations, professional organizations, private sector, and other relevant partners in the health sector. 


V DEFINITION OF TERMS 

1. Diabetes mellitus — a group of metabolic disorders characterized by high blood sugar  levels, i.e. a fasting-plasma glucose concentration above 7.0 mmol/l (126 mg/dl) or a postprandial (approximately 2hOurS after a main meal) plasma glucose concentration above 11.0 mmol //(200mg/1) on two separate occasions.

3. The Philippine Package of Essential Noncommunicable Disease Interventions Protococol on the Integrated Management of Hypertension and Diabetes adopted from the WHO PEN and adopted for country use. 

4. Protocol on the Integrated Management of Hypertension and Diabetes. The ﬁrst clinical protocol develOped under WHO PEN that makes use of the total risk approach using hypertension, diabetes and tobaccouse as the entry points. It speciﬁcally involves the use of the WHO/ISH risk prediction charts to determine the risk of developing a cardiovascular event, i.e. heart attack or stroke over a ten period and . management guidelines for risk reduction appropriate referral, regular follow-up, core set of technologies and essential medicines. 

5. Risk Factor Assessment is the key process of evaluating individuals for the presence or absenCe of common risk factors that expose them to increased likelihood of develOping NCDS. 

6. Risk Screening is the presumptive identiﬁcation of unrecognized disease or the presence intermediate risk factors by the appliCation of test and procedures which can be applied rapidly.

7. Risk Stratiﬁcation estimating the level of risks of indiViduals for a fatal or non-fatal cardiovascular event in 10 years. 

8. Total Risk Approach is a structured method to identifying, assessing and managing. the major risk factors shared by cardiovascular diseases (CVD), cancer,'diabetes and chronic respiratOry disease. 

9. WHO PEN World Health-Organization Package of Essential Noncommunicable 

10. Disease Intervention provides a minimum set of interventions for detection , prevention, treatment and care of CVD and risk factors (heart disease,- stroke, hypertension), diabates, chronic respiratory disease (asthma and COPD) and cancer deemed feasible for implementation even in low resource settings with a modest increase in investment, that can be delivered by primary care physicians and non- physician health workers in primary health care settings. 

VI: GENERAL GUIDELINES:

VII SPECIFIC GUIDELINES AND PROCEDURES: 

These Speciﬁc guidelines and procedures shall be instituted at the primary health care level facilities all over the country, i.e. (barangay health stations, rural health units, community health centers and the like, whatever is appropriate. A manual of operatiOn will be issued containing more details. 

1. Target Population 
All individuals aged 25 years old and above with no established cardiovascular disease (angina pectoris, coronary heart disease, myocardial infarction and transient ischemic attacks), cerebrovascular-disease (CeVD) or peripheral vascular disease (PVD) or have not undergone coronary revascrilarizatiOn or carotid endarterectomy will undergo Risk Factor Assessment. (WHO 2007) I

5. Risk Assessment and Screening Risk Factor Assessment is the key process of evaluating individuals for the presence or absence of common risk faCtors that expose them to increased likelihood of developing NCDS. Risk factor assessment involves asking speciﬁc questions . to determine the individual’s age, sex, family history of diseases assoCiated with NCDS among ﬁrst degree relatives, theuse Of alcohol and tobacco, physical inactivity and diet. Risk Screening is the presumptive identiﬁcation of unrecognized diseaSe or the presence of intermediate risk factors by the application Of tests and‘procedures which can be applied rapidly. The primary goal of risk screening is to detect a disease in its early ”stages to be able to treat it and prevent its further deveIOpment. It must be understood that screening is not a _ diagnostic measure bat 'it is a preliminary step in the assessment of the individual’s chances of becoming unhealthy. (DOH, 2009) This involves tests to measure central adiposity and obesity, raised blood pressure, raised blood glucose and raised blood cholesterol. 

Following the service pathway in APPENDIX 2, risk assessment will be performed on individuals 25 years old and above. Only those with any of the following will undergo . risk screening: 

-Age greater than 40 years 
-Tobacco/Cigarette Smoking 
-Central Adiposity' 
-Raised Blood Pressure 
-Diabetes 
-Family History of Hypertension, Stroke or Heart Attack 
-Family History of Diabetes or Kidney Disease 

At the primary health care facilities, the NCD Risk Assessment and Screening Form (refer to APPENDIX 3) will be used to record the results Of the riSk assessment and screening. The questionnaire to determine probable angina, heart attack, stroke & TIA (WHO, 2002) and the tests to determine the presence of urine protein and urine ketones are incorporated In this form In order to determine individuals who need to be referred to  a higher level of Care for further diagnosis and management.  

In ﬁlling-out the NCD Risk Assessment and Screening Form, an indiVidual 13 considered at risk if he or she: 

I has a ﬁrst degree relative with any of the following conditions: hypertension, stroke, heart attack, diabetes and kidney disease. 

- currently smokes or stopped smoking for less than a year or is exposed to cigarette smoke (passive smoker) 
- consumes exceSsive alcohol. Excessive alcohol intake is deﬁned as having more than 2 drinks for males and more than 1 drink in females or having 5 drinks in one occasion. 
- consumes high fat/high salt food frequently
- consumes less than 3 servings of vegetables and 2 servings of fruits daily 
- has less than 2 1/2 hours of moderate intensity physical activity weekly 
- has a body mass index (BMI) equal to or more than 23
- I has a waist circumference equal toor more than 90. centimeters in-males or 80 centimeters in females 
- has a blood pressure reading above 120 mmHg systolic or 80 mmHg diastolic, taken as the mean of two readings on each of two occasions 
- has a fasting blood glucose concentration above 7. 0 mmol/l or 126 mg/dl or a random blood glucose concentration above 11.0 mmol/l or 200 mg/dl
- has a total blood-cholesterol concentration above 5.3 mmol/l or 200 mg/dl 


6. Referral 
Coordination mechanisms with the next referral level should be established fOr clients who need specialist or hospital care. Following Action 3 of the WHO PEN Protocol for the Integrated Management of Hypertension and Diabetes, individuals With any of the conditions below will be referred to a higher level facility: 

-Blood Pressure of 2140 (systole) or >90 mmHg (diastole) in people below 40 years old (to exclude secondary hypertension) 

-Known heart disease, stroke, TIA, DM, kidney disease (for assessment as necessary) Angina, claudication 

-Worsening heart failure 

-Raised Blood Pressure 2140/90 (in DM above 130/80 mmHg) in Spite of treatment with 2 or 3 agents 

-Any proteinuria 

-Newly diagnosed diabetes "with urine ketones 2+ or in leanperson of below 30 years old . DM with fasting blood glucose > 14 Immol/l despite maximal metformin with or without sulphonylurea  

-DM with severe infection and/or foot ulcers 

7. Risk Stratiﬁcation - Following risk assessment and screening, the level of risks Of individuals who are not referred to a higher level facility will be estimated using the WHO/ISH Risk Prediction Charts for the Western Paciﬁc Region (refer to Appendix 3). 

Classiﬁcation of the lO—Year Risk of Fatal or Non-fatal. Cardiovascular Event: 

 
<image>table_1.png</image>

Charts are not necessary for making treatment decisions-in individuals. Who are. at high cardiovascular risk because they have established cardiovascular disease or very high levels of individual risk factors. All of them need intensive lifestyle interventions and appropriate drug therapy. They include people: 

-with established cardiovascular disease 

-without established CVD who have a total cholesterol > 8 mmol/l (320 mg/dl) or low- density lipoprotein (LDL') cholesterol 2 6 mmol/l (240 mg/dl) or TC/HDL- C (total cholesterol/high density lipoprotein cholesterol) ratio > 8” 

-without established CVD who have persistent raised blood pressure (>160—170/100— 105 mmHg) 

-with type 1 or 2 diabetes, with overt nephropathy or other signiﬁcant renal diSease I with renal failure or renal impairment. 

8. Risk Management Management guidelines for risk reduction Will follow Action 5 of the WHO PEN Protocol for the Integrated Management of Hypertension and Diabetes (WHO 2010) and the Pocket Guidelines for Assessment and Management of Cardiovascular Risk WHO 2007).
