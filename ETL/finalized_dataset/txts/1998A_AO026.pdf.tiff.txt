<subject>SUBJECT: Addendum to Administrative Order No. 25 s. 1998 re: Guidelines for the procurement of anti-TB drugs at the Regional Health Offices using the 1998 National Tuberculosis Program (NTP) funds.</subject>

<body>

EO 302 (Guidelines, Rules and Regulations for the Procurement of Goods/Supplies by the National Government) specifically provides for various  alternative methods of procurement and the conditions under which such methods may be adopted In the interest of economy and efficiency.

On the basis of the documents submitted by the bidders, the DOH management deemed it necessary to adopt DIRECT CONTRACTING as the alternative method of procuring Anti TB Drugs taking into account the emergency nature of its procurement.

Further delay in the procurement of Anti TB Drugs may cause widespread shortage of the said Drugs at the implementing units which may lead to drug resistance and ultimately, death of patients who are dependent on said drugs.
