<subject>SUBJECT: The National Filariasis Control Program: Strategy Shift from Filariasis Control to the Elimination of Filariasis</subject>

<body>

I. RATIONALE:

Lymphatic Filariasis continues to strike vulnerable people of all ages and both sexes especially those in the working age group, both globally and in  the Philippines. This profoundly disfiguring and disabling disease often afflicts the marginalized groups living in rural, remote and inaccessible areas.

Remarkable advances in the understanding of the disease reveal a wider spectrum of hugely subclinical pathology, involving extensive internal damage of renal and lymphatic system, even among asymptomatic and amicrofilaremic infected cases, a variety of cryptic infections exemplified by Tropical Pulmonary Eosinophilia, the presence of millions of worms in the body and the classic
overt manifestations of adenolymphangitic attacks (Filarial fevers), hydrocoele and elephantiasis.

The control of the disease once presented a dismal prospect. Diagnosis relied on the old, tedious, laborious conventional method, the Nocturnal Blood Examination (NBE). Studies from local and foreign researchers have shown its  low sensitivity, resulting to larger number of infected individuals undetected and therefore untreated. The Standard Selective Treatment, the mode of parasitic control used by the program since its inception, is based and dependent on the results of the less sensitive NBE. Problems in Compliance to the treatment scheme occurs due to adverse reactions from the 12—day dose of Diethylcarbamazine Citrate (DEC) (drug of choice), given at 6 mg/kg/day.

With new control technologies, the elimination of Filariasis has become possible. The discovery of Rapid Assessment Methods such as the Immunochromatographic Test for Filariasis (ICT), which is an antigen test that can be done at daytime provides a convenient substitute to the cumbersome NBE. With the advent of Mass Treatment to eliminate Filariasis, Community
Diagnosis where a subset sampling of the total population to be surveyed allows diagnosis of endemic communities, is an improvement over Individual Diagnosis. Mass Treatment of endemic communities with DEC or combination of DEC and Albendazole effects a 90-99% clearance of infective microfilaria in the blood of infected, interrupting transmission and effecting elimination of the disease.

In 1995, the World Health Assembly (WHA) included Filariasis as one of the six eradicable diseases. In 1997, WHA declared “Filariasis Elimination as a priority". In January 1998, the World Health Organization issued a press release calling for the ”Global Elimination of the disease”. The task is not merely of Eliminating a disease called Filariasis, but of protecting children, present and future, from the scourge of the disease.



II. STRATEGIC SHIFT FROM FILARIASIS CONTROL TO FILARIASIS ELIMINATION

The Department of Health is heeding the global call for elimination of Filariasis as a public health problem. The elimination of Filariasis is an opportunity that must not be missed. 

It is in this light that there should be a change in policy by shifting emphasis from control to elimination, and, henceforth it shall be known as the National Filariasis Elimination Program (NFEP).



III. THE NATIONAL FILARIASIS ELIMINATION PROGRAM


A. PROGRAM GOALS AND OBJECTIVES

PROGRAM GOAL: Elimination of Filariasis as a public health problem in the Philippines

B. OBJECTIVES
GENERAL OBJECTIVE: To decrease Prevalence Rate of Filariasis in endemic municipalities to less than 1/1000 population.

SPECIFIC OBJECTIVES:

1. IDENTIFY ENDEMIC MUNICIPALITIES AT THE END OF TWO YEARS

2. PROVIDE MASS TREATMENT OF ESTABLISHED ENDEMIC MUNICIPALITIES FOR 4 YEARS

3. CONTINUE SURVEILLANCE OF ENDEMIC AREAS 5 YEARS AFTER MASS TREATMENT


C. CATEGORIZATION OF MUNICIPALITIES IN THE COUNTRY

CATEGORY 1 - Municipalities in provinces established as endemic areas for Filariasis, with recent reports of endemicity
(within past 10 years)
- All provinces in Regions 5, 8, 11, two provinces in Region 4 and one province in Region 9.

CATEGORY 2 - Municipalities in provinces identified as endemic in 1960 survey excluding provinces in Category 1, without report of endemicity in the last 10 years
- Five provinces in Region 4, four provinces in CARAGA Region, three provinces in Region 7 & 10, two provinces in Regions 3, 9, 12 & ARMM AND ONE PROVINCE IN Regions 1 and CAR

CATEGORY 3 — Municipalities in provinces tagged as non—endemic for Filariasis (Reg. 2, 6 & NCR) and with no report of endemicity at any previous time
- All provinces in Regions 2, 6 & NCR


D. STRATEGIES/ ACTIVITIES

1. MAPPING OF ENDEMIC AREAS
Mapping of endemic municipalities in each province will involve:
a. Community Diagnosis - subset sampling of the total population to be surveyed. One barangay per municipality, examining a total of 200 persons/brgy will be surveyed to represent the municipality.
b. Immunochromatographic Test For Filariasis (ICT) - a Rapid Assessment antigen test that can be used at daytime to detect Filaria infection
c. Deformity Survey — determining the presence of clinical cases through interview of key informants, community surveys and review of records in hospitals.

2. CAPABILITY BUILDING
This will be done through:
a. Advocacy- motivating and soliciting the support and participation of the Local Government Units
b. Training of healthworkers
c. Development of Family Competencies - five competencies of families in the prevention, control and elimination of Filariasis in study areas, primarily by education and by other strategies.
d. Community Organizing — will involve the formation of Core Groups like the Municipal Filariasis Elimination Committee and Family Clusters and empowering them for action.
e. Vector control — an adjunct and supportive strategy focusing on personal protection measures
f. Morbidity control- Establishing “Referral and Support Groups for chronic patients.

3. MASS TREATMENT

a. Drug Regimen - Drugs for Mass Treatment is a combination of Diethylcarbamazine Citrate (DEC) and Albendazole

DOSE: DEC will be given at a dose of 6mg/kg bwt. and Albendazole at a dose of 400 mg/ single standardized dose

b. Coverage - Individuals from ages 2 yrs and above living in endemic areas will be covered for Mass Treatment.

c. Exclusion Criteria & Special Precautions
* Treatment of pregnant women will be deferred until delivery.
* Special precautions in treating individuals with cardiac & kidney diseases should be observed.

d. Outlet
Drugs will be delivered through a “Filaria Health Fair” conducted annually for four years in all barangays in endemic municipality. Activities in “Health Fair" include:

1. General Health Check-up
2. Community/Family Contests 
3. Exhibits
4. Dispensing of mass Treatment Dose per Family 

Families not covered in “Filaria Health Fair” will be covered in Family Clusters, one week later.

e. Management of Side Effects
Adverse side effects like, fever, headache, nausea shall be recorded and provided symptomatic treatment.

4. Monitoring

<image>table_1.png</image>

* no of person (+) for microﬁlarial no. of person examined X 100
** total no. of microﬁlaria count over no. of people examined

5. EVALUATION

a. SITE - Sentinel Sites of 1 barangay/province

b. INDICATORS:
-MF RATE
-MF DENSITY
—ANTIGEN RATE — no. of person (+) in ICT over no. of people examined)

c.SCHEDULE OF MEASUREMENT- baseline blood survey and post-treatment blood survey will be conducted.

d. NATIONAL CERTIFICATION OF ELIMINATION
Filariasis will be certified as eliminated in a municipality under the following conditions:

Category 1: Completion of Mass Treatment for four years and with Post-treatment Prevalence Rate of less than 1/1000.
Category 2: Previously endemic municipalities still found to be endemic after survey, Completion of Mass Treatment for four years and with Post—treatment Prevalence Rate of less than 1/1000.
Previously endemic municipalities found to be non—endemic after survey: 5-year Cumulative Prevalence Rate of less than 1/1000 by background surveillance.
Category 3:Previously non-endemic municipalities before and after mapping and with 5 Year Cumulative Prevalence Rate of less than 1/1000 by background surveillance.

6. POST-INTERVENTION SURVEILLANCE
Continued Surveillance after 4 years of Mass Treatment in an endemic area in order to detect new tool of transmission, to provide data on infection trends In the overall population and to certify that interruption of transmission has been achieved. It will also be required in non-endemic areas.

a. Site-Sentinel Sites of brgy/province
- BACKGROUND SURVEILLANCE — passive casefinding either through mandatory screening of blood donors, military recruits or schoolchildren.

b. Indicators 	— ANTIGEN RATE
		- MF RATE
		- MF DENSITY

c. Schedule—every year for five years after the completion of Mass Treatment

d. INTERNATIONAL CERTIFICATION OF ELIMINATION OF FILARIASIS
Filariasis will be certified as eliminated in the Philippines by a WHO Committee upon compliance with the following conditions:

— A Cumulative Incidence Rate over five years of less than 1 new case per 1000 susceptible individuals measured yearly after completion of the Mass Treatment scheme in each endemic municipality in the country.

Provision of the necessary documentation and satisfaction of the needed international requirements will warrant approval of the country’s application for "INTERNATIONAL CERTIFICATION OF ELIMINATION” of Filariasis.


E. GENERAL ACTIVITIES PER CATEGORY
