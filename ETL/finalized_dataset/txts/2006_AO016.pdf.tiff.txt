<subject>SUBJECT: National Policy and Strategic Framework on Child Injury Prevention</subject>

<body>
I. BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE

The World Health Organization estimated that in the year 2002, about 875,000 children under the age of 18 years died as a result of injury. Moreover, injuries account for approximately 6% of the global burden of disease for children under the age of 15 years (WHO, 2002). Majority of these injuries resulted from falls, animal bites, violence and assaults, poisoning, drowning, burns and road traffic accidents. Poor children were disproportionately affected; more than 98% of these deaths occurred in low- and middle-income countries, particularly Africa, the Eastern Mediterranean Region, South Asia and the Western Pacific (WHO, 2005). These studies showed that injury now constituted a significant part of childhood mortality and morbidity.

In the Philippines, accidents and injuries are the 5th leading causes of morbidity with a rate of 308 per 100,000 population. Furthermore, it is the 6th leading cause of mortality with a rate of 42 deaths per 100,000 population (DOH, 2000). According to the Philippine National Injury Survey (Lim et al, 2003), vehicular accidents, falls, poisoning, violence and assaults, drowning, and animal bites account for injuries among children below 18 years of age. The impact of these injuries on society is appalling; families are deprived of their children and children who survived had to learn to cope with the consequences of their injury, which, in some cases, can be both long-lasting and profound. This situation is further compounded by the economic burden imposed on the affected families.

Several initiatives were undertaken by non-government and other government organizations, business sectors, professional societies and the academe to address the prevailing situation. However, there is a need to strengthen collaborative efforts to impact on child injury prevention. In response, the Department of Health with the support from the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) convened all injury prevention stakeholders to a consultative forum held in January 2006. A consensus was reached, endorsing the recommendations contained in the National Strategic Framework on Injury Prevention and Safety Promotion among Children in the Philippines, a paper prepared by the Technical Working Group on Child Injury Prevention (TWG-CAIP). The paper called for establishing an infrastructure to support an integrated strategy, evidence-based programming, research and surveillance, safety promotion, and capability-building.

To guide stakeholders in planning interventions for injury prevention, the National Policy and Strategic Framework on Child Injury Prevention is hereby formulated. This shall serve as a sub-document to the overall framework of a national injury and violence prevention program under which a number of specific injury issues could be addressed.

II. DECLARATION OF POLICIES

The policy and strategic framework shall be guided by the following legal mandates:

A. Article 24 of the 1989 United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child emphasized the social responsibility of the member States to protect children and to provide them with appropriate support and services, emphasizing their right to the highest attainable level of health and the right to safe environment, free from injury and violence.

B. The 1987 Philippine Constitution mandates through Article 15, Section 3, that "The State shall defend the right of children to assistance including proper care and nutrition, special protection from all forms of neglect, abuse cruelty, exploitation, and other conditions prejudicial to their development."

C. Article 13, Section 11 of the 1987 Philippine Constitution adjured the State to protect and promote the right to health of every Filipino by making quality and adequate health care available and accessible, especially the underprivileged. This entails the adoption of an integrated and comprehensive approach to health development; implying a multi-sectoral partnership and multi-level health care delivery system.

D. Administrative Order No. 2005-0023 of the Department of Health identified Fourmula One for Health as the implementing mechanism for health sector reforms, thereby ensuring better health outcomes, at more responsive public health system, and a more equitable health care financing for all Filipinos. This involved critical reform initiatives in the areas of health financing, regulation, service delivery and governance.

E. Executive Order No. 310 adopted the Philippine National Strategic Framework for Plan Development for Children (Child 2]) as the national framework to promote and safeguard the rights of Filipino children. It aims to synchronize family, community, and national efforts toward the full realization of the rights of children (is. survival, development, protection, and participation); advocating not only for a more focused targeting for children but also for interfacing critical interventions at the various stages of child development.

F. Chapter 3, Sections 18 to 20 of the Magna Carta for Disabled Persons (RA. No. 7277) required the Department of Health to institute a national health program which shall provide quality and affordable health services covering prevention of disability, early detection and timely intervention to arrest disabling conditions, and medical treatment and rehabilitation.

III. OBJECTIVE

This Administrative Order aims to:

A. Provide a strategic framework for child injury prevention implementation that is anchored on health sector reforms

B. Provide policy direction for DOH offices, its attached agencies, LGU and other partners in terms of prioritizing activities related to child injury prevention

C. Provide guidance to partners in the health sector identifying priority areas for support in the context of multi-sectoral collaboration/partnership to generate and mobilize resources

D. Provide guidance to DOH concerned offices and other relevant agencies in facilitating implementation of child injury prevention in the DOH and at LGUs.

IV. COVERAGE AND SCOPE OF APPLICATION

This Order covers the DOH at the Central Office, CHD, Hospital and other attached agencies to provide supportive policy environment and in prioritizing resources for strengthening collaborative efforts for promoting and preventing child injury in the country. It also applies to the entire health sector, as well as the public and private sectors, national agencies and local government units, external development agencies, academe, professional associations and civil society involved in injury prevention among children 0 to 17 years old.

It shall initially focus on the following priority injury causes:

1. Road traffic injuries
2. Burns and scalds
3. Drowning
4. Falls
5. Poisoning

V. DEFINITION OF TERMS

A. Community Capacity - the characteristics of communities that affect their ability to identify, mobilizes and addresses social and public health problems.

B. Empowerment - a process that enables people identify their own concerns and gain the skills and confidence to act upon them.

C. Evidence-based Medicine - is the conscientious, explicit, and judicious use of current best evidence in making decisions about the care of individual patients. The practice of evidence-based medicine means integrating clinical expertise with the best available external clinical evidence from systematic research.

D. Evidence-based Health Care - is a discipline centered upon evidence-based decision-making about groups of patients, or populations, which may be manifest as evidence-based policy-making, purchasing or management.

E. Health Public Policy - is characterized by an explicit concern for health and equity in all areas of policy, and by an accountability of health impact. The main aim of healthy public policy is to create a supportive environment to enable people to lead healthy lives. Such a policy makes healthy choices possible or easier for citizens. It makes social and physical environments. health enhancing.

f. Injury - refers to the physical damage that results when a human body is suddenly or briefly subjected to intolerable levels of energy. It can be a bodily lesion resulting from acute exposure to energy (mechanical, thermal, electrical or radiant) in amounts that exceed the threshold of physiological tolerance, or it can be an impairment of function resulting from lack of one or more vital elements (i.e. air, water, warmth), as in drowning, strangulation or freezing. The time between exposure to the energy and the appearance of an injury is short.

G. Injury Prevention - means making positive choices about minimizing risk at all levels of society, while maintaining healthy, active and safe communities and lifestyles. These choices are strongly influenced by the social, economic and physical environments where one lives, works, learns and plays.

H. Population Health - is an approach to health that aims to improve the health status of the entire population or subpopulations and to reduce health inequities among population groups. It looks and acts upon the determinants of health - i.e. income and social status, social support networks, education, employment and working conditions, physical and social environments, biology and genetic endowment, personal health practices and coping skills, healthy child development, health services, gender and culture.

I. Safety - a state in which hazards and conditions leading to physical injury, i.e. psychological or material harm, are controlled in order to preserve the health and well-being of individuals and the community.

J. Safety Promotion - a process that aims to provide populations with the means to ensure the presence of, and maintain the conditions necessary to reach and sustain, an optimal level of safety

K. Surveillance - the process of systematic collection, orderly consolidation and evaluation of pertinent data with prompt dissemination of the results to those who need to know, particularly those who are in a position to take action.

VI. GENERAL GUIDELINES

A. The Department of Health cognizant of the public health significance of child injuries and its impact in society shall institutionalize a comprehensive Child Injury Prevention Program, guided by the principles of evidence-based practice, partnership and shared responsibility, and integration. This shall be operationalized by means of policy and legislative enforcements, health sector reforms, public information, education and communication, surveillance systems and mun-sectoral collaboration in service provision.

B. The health program for child injury prevention shall be in accordance with the thrusts of the National Objectives for Health (2005 - 2010), Medium Term Development Plan of the Department of Health (2002 - 2010), and Millennium Development Goals (2005 - 2015).

C. The Strategy will initially focus on areas where interventions are possible, effective, and able to be implemented with a clear and actionable role for the health sector. Five priority areas for immediate action by the health sector will be undertaken. These are prevention of: road traffic injuries, falls, burns, poisoning, and drowning

D. In line with the DOH mission to guarantee equitable, sustainable and quality Health For All Filipinos, especially the disadvantaged and vulnerable sectors, the Child Injury Prevention Strategy will be based on a population health approach that addresses the range of factors (i.e. social, economic, cultural, and political) that determine the health and well-being of the overall population.

E. Consistent with the World Health Organization definition of health, the approach views health as an asset and resource for everyday living, not simply the absence of disease. Health depends more than just health care. The population health approach concerns itself with the living, working and economic environments that affect people's health and safety, the conditions that enable and support people in making healthy choices, and the services that promote and maintain health.

F. Numerous determinants of health influence the health of individuals and communities: income and social status, social support networks, education, employment and working conditions, physical environments, genetics, personal health practices and coping skills, health services, gender and culture, and healthy child development. It is the complex interaction of these determinants that has an impact on the health of individuals and communities. These are all factors that make a difference on how long people live, the quality of their lives and their risk of injury.

G. In applying this approach to injury prevention, the burden and the solutions lie not just within the health sector, but evidently with many other sectors, e.g., transportation, public works and highways, labor and industry, education, local government, social welfare, and others.

VII. STRATEGIC FRAMEWORK ON CHILD INJURY PROGRAM

A. VISION AND MISSION

Vision: The Philippines has the lowest child injury rate in Asia.

Mission: Guarantee cost-effective injury prevention interventions to every Filipino child, and ensure sustainable and equitable maid-sectoral support.

B. GOALS: Reduce health disparities that increase the risk of injury among children

and

Reduce societal burden of child injury, and improve the health of the Filipino child.

C. PROGRAM OBJECTIVES

Decrease the incidence, severity, morbidity and mortality associated with child injuries at home, in the community, schools, roadways and acute care settings.

The specific program objectives include the following:

1. To address the health gaps and needs pertaining to injury prevention
2. To empower families and communities in ensuring safety mechanisms for children
3. To expand/strengthen partnerships and multi-sectoral involvement at the national and local levels
4. To increase access to quality care and rehabilitation services
5. To develop a data base on child injury

D. GUIDING PRINCIPLES

The Child Injury Prevention Strategy development is guided by the following principles:

1. Evidence-based Practices

Evidence-based practices can be positioned along a continuum from qualitative to quantitative evidence. Examples ranging from qualitative to quantitative include: opinion based on community experience or cultural knowledge, to descriptive studies, surveys, cohort studies, non-randomized trials, and finally, randomized control trials. Decision-making regarding interventions are to be based on a systematic appraisal of the best evidence available in the context of the prevailing values and resource available.

To prevent the continued waste of valuable resources on practices that may not be effective, practitioners, researchers and policy-makers need to work closely to develop and implement a national research agenda that supports the Strategy, this includes institutionalization of an injury surveillance system. Research has shown that injury prevention strategies that combine environmental design (e.g., road construction, product design), education and legislative and regulatory requirements that support environmental and behavioral change, are most effective.

2. Partnership and Shared Responsibility

A partnership is a voluntary agreement between two or more parties to work cooperatively toward a set of shared outcomes in injury prevention. Partnerships may form part of a multi-sectoral collaboration for Child Injury Prevention, or be based on alliances for specific injury issues. Partnerships may include the public sector, the non-government organizations and the private sector. They may also involve different levels of jurisdiction (e.g. municipal, city, provincial, regional, national and international levels).

The principle of shared responsibility recognizes that injury prevention is not just the responsibility of individuals. Creating conditions conducive to injury prevention is the responsibility of all sectors (e.g. transportation, public works and highways, health, education, industry, and others) and is affected by governments at all levels, the private sector, the non-government organizations, families, schools, workplaces and communities.

Partnerships are an important mechanism for putting the idea of integration into practice.
Effective partnerships have the potential to add value to work that is already being done to
address issues in Child Injury Prevention.

3. Integration

Considerable work is already being done to address specific injury issues (e.g. motor vehicle safety, workplace safety, 'Petron-Road Traffic Accident Prevention', 'Safe Kids', 'Bantay Bata', 'Bisig Bayan') by community groups, governments, non-government organizations and the private sector, including media. Integration shall the major focus of the Strategy. It means working in a more coordinated way to address specific issues together, as much as possible.

E. STRATEGIC DIRECTIONS

The strategic directions have been set for a five-year period, from 2006 up to 2010. To decrease the incidence, severity, morbidity and mortality associated with child and adolescent injuries is the principal objective of the Child Injury Prevention Strategy. Accordingly, the following strategic responses shall be adopted:

1. Enhanced capacity for data collection.

Best evidence for policy, decision making and tracking progress require good data source on interventions that work, surveillance and special surveys. The Child Injury Prevention Program shall make decisions based on evidence gathered routinely from regular monitoring and evaluation. Continuing improvement shall be targeted through research.

2. Legislations and Enforcement.

Support from political leaders is not only necessary to ensure proper funding and effective legislation, but also to give injury prevention efforts increased legitimacy and a higher profile within the public consciousness. Commitment is as important at national level, where policy and legislative decisions are made, as at provincial, district, city and municipal levels, where the day-to-day functioning of many interventions is controlled.

Because many of the determinants of health and injury prevention are influenced by policies and legislations outside of the health sector, all sectors (e.g. health, transportation, public works and highways, labor, education, and others) need to work together in the pursuit of win-win policies that create environments for child and adolescent injury prevention. Governments at all levels have an important role to play in developing healthy public policy. Several laws and ordinances were promulgated to provide safety on the road, at home, in school, workplace and recreational areas. There is a need to monitor adherence to existing laws on safety and injury prevention measures.

3. Transformation of Health Systems.

The prevention of deaths and disability secondary to injury include assuring access to health facilities, improving quality of hospital care through upgraded hospital equipment and enhanced capacity of health personnel, strengthening emergency response mechanisms, and establishing rehabilitation services. In areas where it is not possible to provide tertiary health care and rehabilitation services, a referral system should be established.

Development of standards and regulations for product safety will complement the capacity of the health system to prevent injuries, particularly in poisoning, burns, and other unintentional external causes of injury. Moreover, the present systems for quality control implemented by different government agencies need to be strengthened. There is a need to focus on how standards and regulations, as well as existing laws on safety can be strictly implemented.

4. Resource Generation and Mobilization through Partnerships.

The Child Injury Prevention Strategy encourages multi-sectoral collaboration to generate and mobilize resources. Resource sharing from an established network of stakeholders will increase the capacity to respond to child injuries and their determinants.

It must be emphasized that health inequalities must be addressed through the health financing system, especially. the Philippine Health Insurance System (PHIC). A review of the present coverage for injuries should be undertaken to expand the PHIC benefit packages.

5. Health Workforce Development.

Primary health care workers and secondary-care hospital workers should know how to manage injury cases. The hospitals should also be furnished with basic equipments and supplies in the diagnosis, management and treatment of injuries. Particular emphasis in primary prevention responses will be promoted during skills training.

6. Empowerment of parents, families, and the community.

Improvement of family and community practices shall be the core of safety promotion. Injury prevention entails information, education and communication campaign in all levels of societal structures, which include the home, community, school and workplace. Mass media can be used to intensify health promotion and injury prevention, including early interventions. Appropriate key messages should be developed to effect changes in attitude and behavior. This empowers the people to assume responsibility for their own safety and strengthens their capacity to respond to a range of public health issues on injuries for children and adolescents.

Health promotion approaches that are based on an assessment of community needs, engage and empower communities, and contribute to increased community capacity are most likely to achieve sustainable, long-term outcomes.

VIII. PROGRAM IMPLEMENTATION

A. PROGRAM COMPONENTS

In accordance with the National Injury Prevention and Control Program of the Department of Health, the following program components for Child Injury Prevention will be developed.

1. Health Promotion

This component shall include advocacy, information, education and communication activities addressed to policy makers, other government and non-government agencies, private sectors including media, the general public and other stakeholders concerning the underlying socio-economic and environmental conditions, the individual risk factors, risk behaviors and the impact of child and adolescent injuries on society; to evoke positive socio-political response and changes in the public perceptions about the preventability of injury.

2. Human Resource Development and Management

This component shall focus on enhancing the capability of health and non-health service providers at all levels in injury prevention. It shall include developing mechanisms to guarantee availability and accessibility of accredited training institutions and service providers adept in rendering comprehensive injury prevention interventions for each key settings, which may include, but not limited to the community, schools, homes, leisure and sports areas.

3. Surveillance System

This component shall ensure that a system of data recording and reporting of child and adolescent injuries is established and institutionalized at the national, regional and local levels. A health information system shall be developed for this purpose. The system shall adopt the ICD-10 for the definitions and classification of injuries, and include other pertinent data for monitoring and evaluation of program effects. All injury stakeholders shall cooperate and coordinate with the Department of Health for information exchange which shall be made available and accessible to all end-users for evidence-based decision-making.

4. Networking and Linkages

This component shall establish multi-sectoral collaboration and partnerships with injury stakeholders at the national, regional and local levels. It shall take into account the mandates and activities of the various stakeholders involved in child injury prevention, and forge agreements and commitments in the following areas, but not limited to advocacy and awareness campaigns, research, information exchange, service provision and referrals, resource sharing, and regulatory enforcements.

5. Equitable Health Financing Package

In coordination with the Philippine Health Insurance Corporation (PHIC), this component shall formulate PHIC-indigent packages for injury-related sequelae. Compensations and other benefit packages for work-related injuries shall be addressed through existing programs for employees in the private sector (Social Security System) and public sector (Government Service Insurance System) in consonance with the guidelines developed by the Employee's Compensation Commission.

6. Research and Development

This component shall establish a research agenda to build knowledge and evidences, and gain a better understanding of child injuries in relation to the determinants of health. Thus, appropriate responses can be developed and evaluated. It shall include, but not limited to the causes of injury, it consequences, costs and impact of interventions.

7. Service Delivery

This component shall establish a comprehensive and integrated package of service provisions in all levels of the health care delivery system, with emphasis on primary prevention. If necessary, cross-sectoral intervention management shall be instituted through appropriate referral mechanisms. The principle of evidence-based practice shall be applied to all interventions to ensure quality care and cost-effectiveness.

8. Monitoring and Evaluation

This component shall identify key indicators for the evaluation of program effects, which include, process (strategy objectives), impact (program objectives) and outcome (program goals) for each of the six priority areas. The results of the evaluations shall be used in revising or formulating policies, guidelines, strategies and program plans for child and adolescent injury prevention.

B. TYPES OF INJURY

For analysis purposes and for identifying intervention opportunities, injuries are categorized according to whether or not they were deliberately inflicted and by whom. Based on the International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, 10th Revision (ICD-10), the following categories will be adapted:

1. Unintentional (i.e. accidental)

a. Road traffic injuries - any injury due to crashes originating, terminating or involving a vehicle partially or fully on a public highway or street.

b. Poisoning - all unintentional poisoning-related deaths and non-fatal outcomes caused by exposure to noxious substances. Those which are intentional or for which the intent is undetermined as well as those resulting from reactions to drugs are excluded from the definition used here.

c. Falls - fall-related deaths and non-fatal injuries exclude those due to assault and intentional self-harm. Falls from animals, burning buildings and transport vehicles, and falls into fire, water and machinery are also excluded.

d. Burns - occur when some or all of the different layers of cells in the skin are destroyed by a hot liquid (scald), a hot solid (contact burns) or a flame (flame burns). Skin injuries due to ultraviolet radiation, radioactivity, electricity or chemicals, as well as respiratory damage resulting from smoke inhalation, are also considered to burns.

e. Drowning - all unintentional drowning and submersions (with the exception of those which occur as a result of cataclysm, transport and water transport accidents) are classified as drowning deaths.

f. Other intentional injuries - includes exposure to animate and inanimate mechanical forces (including firearms); exposure to extreme ambient temperature and pressure, and to forces of nature; contact with venomous plants and animals; and other external causes.

2. Intentional (i.e. deliberate)

a. Interpersonal violence - the intentional use of physical force or power, threatened or actual, against oneself, another person, or against a group or community, that either results in or has a likelihood of resulting in injury, death, psychological harm, maldevelopment, or deprivation. Interpersonal violence-related mortality. includes deaths due to homicide, sexual assault, neglect and abandonment, and other form of maltreatment.

b. Self-harm - includes self-inflicting poisoning or injury (e.g. abuse of drugs and alcohol, and self-mutilation).

c. Suicide - is defined as a death arising from an act inflicted upon oneself with the intent to kill oneself.

d. Legal intervention - includes actions by police or other law enforcement personnel involving firearm discharge, explosives, gas, blunt/sharp objects, and other specified means.

e. War, civil insurrection and disturbances - includes injuries to military personnel and civilians caused by war and civil insurrection (e.g. demonstrations and riots).

f. Undetermined intent - events where available information is insufficient to enable a medical or legal authority to make a distinction between accident, self-harm and assault. It includes self-inflicted injuries, but not poisoning, when not specified whether accidental or with intent to harm.

IX. IMPLEMENTING GUIDELINES

A. ORGANIZATIONAL STRUCTURE

Based on the activities of the Five-Year Strategic Workplan, the organizational structures shall be established, with delineation of roles and responsibilities, and identification of areas of coordination and collaboration among all child injury prevention stakeholders.

1. National Structure

a. A National Child Injury Prevention Partnership (NCIPP) shall be created by virtue of an Administrative Executive Order; designating the Department of Health, represented by the Undersecretary of Health Program Development Cluster and the Council for the Welfare of Children, represented by its Executive Director as co-chairs. The NCIPP meetings shall be alternately convened and presided by both agencies. Composed of core staff from both agencies, other government and non-government agencies, professional societies, academe, other public and private sectors, it shall be responsible for developing and implementing a national action plan for child injury prevention. It shall call on the different agencies to do their part in preventing child injury.

a.1 Sub-committees shall be organized corresponding to the five priority areas as necessary. According to specific areas of involvement, the sub-committees shall comprise sector representatives and DOH program managers. In coordination with the regional and local implementing committees, it shall be responsible for program monitoring and evaluation based on their respective priority areas, and provide recommendations to the NCIPP.

a.2 There shall be a Secretariat responsible for coordinating the meetings, preparation of agenda and documenting the minutes of the meeting and shall come from the agency responsible for convening the NCIPP meetings.

2. Regional and Local Structures

b. Program strategies and activities undertaken at the local level shall be managed by the Regional Child Injury Prevention Partnership (RCIPP) or by existing committees that can absorb this function. The composition and organizational arrangements shall correspond to the NCIPP. For NCIPP without regional counterparts, other stakeholders shall be encouraged to be involved.

c. Program implementation shall. be carried out at the provincial, city, municipal and barangay levels. The composition and organizational arrangements shall relate to the RCIPP. Each corresponding level shall be under the leadership of the chief local executive. For RCIPP without local counterparts, other stakeholders shall be encouraged to be involved.

B. Roles and Responsibilities

1. Department of Health

The Department of Health as the lead agency, undertook the initial assessment of the magnitude of the problem of child injury in the country. It shall continuously raise awareness among its partners in the government and private sectors, advocate for and create political commitment, and set up a multi-sectoral mechanism on child injury prevention.

The Department of Health, and for that matter the health sector, has the primary responsibility of providing care to the victims of violence and injury Formulation of policies to prevent injury may be the scope of other agencies, but the health system may help shape these policies by providing data on health outcomes and effective intervention based on science-based approaches. Specifically, the health sector has the following core tasks:

• Develop a surveillance system to capture incidence and prevalence of injuries
• Collect, analyze and disseminate data on the magnitude and health consequences of injuries
• Advocate for action to prevent and control injuries
• Make available preventive, emergency, curative and rehabilitative services
• Train public health and health-care providers in injury prevention and care
• Design and implement IEC activities
• Evaluate the intervention activities using a science-based approach

2. Role of the Local Government Units (LGUS)

The LGUs should be able to translate the national policy on child injury into local policies or ordinances for implementation. The LGUs shall facilitate the allocation of funds and generate resources from its various partners in the field. They shall harness the involvement of government agencies, non-government agencies, families and communities and other stakeholders for a unified action towards child injury prevention.

3. Role of other government agencies, the nongovernment agencies, private sector, civil society and other partners

The wide range of causes of and solutions to injury problems entail stakeholders from various disciplines and competencies. Each potential stakeholder shall pitch in their expertise and competence, resources and skills, adopting a multi-sectoral, joint action-oriented effort with no competition and conflict of interests. The problem of injuries cannot be solved by a single agency on its own.

C. FUNDING 

The Department of Health and Centers for Health Development shall provide funds for technical assistance, monitoring and advocacy campaigns. The Council for the Welfare of Children, other national government and non-government agencies, local government units and other stakeholders shall contribute counterpart funds to ensure and sustain the implementation of the Child Injury Prevention Program.
