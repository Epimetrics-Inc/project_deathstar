<subject>SUBJECT: GUIDELINES FOR MANAGING RABIES EXPOSURES SECONDARY TO BITE/S BY VACCINATED DOGS AND CATS. </subject>


<body>
I. BACKGROUND/RATIONALE 

Rabies, present in all continents and endemic in most African and Asian countries, is a fatal zoonotic viral disease, transmitted to humans through contact with infected animals, both domestic and wild. Rabies is estimated to cause at least 55,000 deaths per year worldwide, about 56% of which occur in Asia and 43.6% in Africa, particularly in rural areas on both continents. In the Philippines, although rabies is not among the leading causes of morbidity and mortality, it is considered a signiﬁcant public health problem for several reasons: 1) it is one of the most acutely fatal infections; 2) it is responsible for the death of 200-300 Filipinos annually and 3) post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) for victims of animal bites entails considerable expense. 

The Department of Health and Department of Agriculture continues to be committed to the ﬁght against rabies and has set the goal of rabies elimination in 2020. An essential part of this strategy is the provision of PEP to bite victims as mandated by the Anti- Rabies Act of 2007. Pursuant thereto, guidelines for the appropriate as well as cost- effective management of animal bite patients have been issued. 

Historically the management of animal bite cases had to be updated every ﬁve (5) years and the guidelines need to be revised accordingly to incorporate new and better treatment modalities based on research results and recommendations of international bodies. The ﬁrst revision was made in 1997, the second in 2002 and the 3rd in 2007 which was amended in 2009. 

Since the release of the latest guidelines in 2009, the issue on the management of rabies exposure secondary to bites from vaccinated dogs and cats has not been adequately addressed. This has been consistently raised by veterinarians in many fora, particularly the issue on giving PEP to all bite cases even those involving vaccinated dogs and cats. Given the above situation, a joint DA- DOH Administrative Order is hereby issued. 


II. DECLARATION OF POLICIES 

These operational guidelines shall be guided by the following legal mandates and policies:

III. GOALS AND OBJECTIVES 

To provide updated guidelines and procedures to ensure the effective and efﬁcient management of rabies exposures toward eventual reduction, if not elimination, of human rabies 

IV. SCOPE AND COVERAGE

V. DEFINITION OF TERMS 

A.

B. The Rabies Control Program shall be integrated with the regular health services provided by local health facilities. 

C. PEP shall be carried out both by the Department of Health and Local Govermnent Units. 

D. The funding requirements to operationalize this issuance shall be secured prior to its implementation. 

E. Advocacy through information dissemination and training of health workers shall be conducted at all levels.
