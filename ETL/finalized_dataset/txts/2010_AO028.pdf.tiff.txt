<subject>SUBJECT: Policies and Guidelines in the Conduct of Human Immunodeﬁciency Virus (HIV) Counseling and Testing in Community and Health Facility Settings.</subject>


<body>
I. INTRODUCTION AND RATIONALE 

The Philippines still maintains less than one (1) percent prevalence rate of HIV infection. ‘ Preventive interventions must be undertaken by the country in order to maintain its low prevalence status, and the Department of Health and other concerned agencies are focusing their efforts thereon. 

Pursuant to the 4th AIDS Medium Term Plan (2005—2010), HIV counseling and testing is one of the preventive interventions used to reach the most at risk population. The at-risk and vulnerable populations for HIV infection include people in prostitution, men having sex with men, people who inject drugs, and migrant workers. HIV counseling and testing is being advocated to the most at risk population because through this intervention, the same are given the opportunity to know their HIV status and at the same time are provided with information on risk reduction strategies and location of facilities to treat HIV positive individual. _ 

Since counseling is anchored on HIV testing, efficient post-test counseling can appropriately manage the negative consequences of client’s knowing their HIV status especially if the client tested positive for HIV. On the other hand, poor quality counseling which may inadequately address client issues may result 1n suicide, depression and other psychological consequences in persons tested positive for HIV. 

Furthermore, the importance of implementing quality counseling anchored on HIV testing as _ mandated by Republic Act No. 8504, “AIDS Prevention and Control Act of 1988”, will not only beneﬁt the individual being tested but will also scale up preventive intervention so as to slow down or halt the spread. of HIV. Hence, there is a need to provide a standard in the conduct of HIV counseling and testing.
