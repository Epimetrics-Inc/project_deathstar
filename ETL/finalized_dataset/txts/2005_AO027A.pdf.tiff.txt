<subject>SUBJECT: Amendment to Administrative Order No. 2005 - 0027 “Rules and Reﬂlations Governan the Regulation of HIV Testing Laboratories”</subject>


<body>

Tuberculosis (TB) is one of the most common opportunistic infections among People Living with HIV (PLHIV). Since TB significantly contributes to the mortality of PLHIV, one strategy identiﬁed to address this concern was to put up a TB DOTS laboratory with HIV testing capability as exempliﬁed in Administrative Order (A0) No. 2008 — 0022 “Policies and Guidelines in the Collaborative Approach of TB and HIV Prevention and Control”.

Another major public health concern is the Sexually Transmitted Infections (STI) which has been shown to increase the risk of HIV. Performance of rapid serologic tests for HIV will enhance the availability of testing in Social Hygiene Clinics (SHC).

In view of the above, Section V. A. 1. of A0 No. 2005-0027 “Rules and Regulations Governing the Regulation of HIV Testing Laboratories" is hereby amended to allow TB DOTS Centers and SHC to operate an HIV testing laboratory under the direct supervision of the National AIDS! STl Prevention and Control Program and the National Reference Laboratory — STD/ AIDS Central Cooperative Laboratory/ San Lazaro Hospital. Furthermore, these laboratories are exempted from securing a license to operate a clinical laboratory, provided strict adherence to program policies and participation in their respective Quality Assurance Programs are observed.

This Order shall take effect immediately.
