<subject>SUBJECT: SETTING THE DEADLINE FOR THE FINAL PHASE OUT OF POTASSIUM BROMATE AS FLOUR TREATMENT AGENT TO END OF SEPTEMBER 1996</subject>

<body>


This Administrative Order is issued pursuant to Section 26 (a) of R.A. 3720 as amended in relation to article 21 (a) and (b) of R.A. 7394.

In View of the 38th report of the Joint (FAO and WHO) 1992 Expert Committee of Food and Additives which states that: “Recent oral long-term toxicity/carcinogenicity studies of potassium bromate revealed renal cell tumours, peritoneal mesotheliomas and thyroid follicular cell tumours in rats and a slightly increased incidence of renal cell tumours in hamsters”, the Department of Health is taking all precautions against the use of potassium bromate as a flour treatment agent.

As such, the final deadline for phasing out the use of potassium bromate as a flour treatment agent is set on September 30,1996 specifically including at the level of flour millers. This Order supersedes provisions of Administrative Order No. 39 s. 1994 and BFAD Circular No. 1 s. 1995 on the tentative schedule for the phase-out of Potassium Bromate as food additive.

After this final date of September 30, 1996, any Potassium-Bromate containing ingredient in bread making and bread as well as bakery productsusing Potassium-Bromate shall be considered adulterated in accordance withSection 14 of R.A. 3720 as amended.

This Order shall take effect after publication in two (2) newspapers of general circulation at least one week for a period of not less than one month.
