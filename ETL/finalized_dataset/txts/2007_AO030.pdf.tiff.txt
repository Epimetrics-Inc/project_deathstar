<subject>SUBJECT: Implementation Guidelines for the WHO Support to the Health Sector</subject>

<body>
I. BACKGROUND/RATIONALE

The significant lessons learned from past experiences in undertaking Health Reforms have paved the way for its full implementation under the FOURmula One (F1) for Health Strategy. This strategic Framework is designed to bring about critical interventions as a single package, backed by effective management infrastructure and financing arrangements.

Following the Sector Development Approach for Health (SDAH) principle and given the growing interest and support to Health Sector Reforms, from external development partners, as well as national and local, public and private stakeholders, it is imperative that all efforts are harnessed, consolidated and directed to bring about the health outcomes that this country strives to attain.

The World Health Organization (WHO) is one of the external development partners, that has, for a long time, provided support to the Health Sector. But more than just a donor, the WHO is a leading technical resource which the Philippine Health Sector has relied upon, and thus, this Department has positioned it to be its main partner in its attempt to evolve into, among others, an effective technical leader of the sector.

The WHO provides its support to F1 through initiatives that aim to improve impact at country level and contributes to the attainment of the country's international and national commitments, specifically the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), and national health goals as reflected in the Medium Term Philippine Development Plan (MTPDP) and the National Objectives for Health (NOH).

The main WHO support is planned and programmed every two (2) years, as the Biennium Country Budget, which is reflected in an approved WHO work plan. In addition to this, there are extra-budgetary and inter-country funded initiatives, that eventually becomes part of the biennium budget.

The implementation of the WHO supported initiatives has historically been governed by informal guidelines provided as needed by the WHO Country Office.

II. OBJECTIVES

1. To provide the detailed guidelines that shall govern the implementation of the WHO support to the Health Sector, pursuant to the General Guidelines for WHO Program Implementation in the Philippines which was approved and has taken effect on 23rd July 2007, a copy of which is attached and forms part of this issuance.

2. To set the roles and responsibilities of the various partners and key players in the implementation of the WHO Programme.

3. To ensure that the objectives of the Programme are accomplished on time, within the approved budget and in conformity with sound technical performance standards.

III. SCOPE OF APPLICATION

This issuance shall govern the entire WHO support to the Health Sector which, pursuant to the approved WHO work plan, may be implemented through any one of the following modes:

Agreement for Performance of Work (APW) - under this mode of implementation the required piece of work is performed by a contractor in his/ her own time, normally of short duration and not undertaken in WHO premises. The terms and conditions of this work are specified in a legally binding document, the APW. The works that maybe contracted through APW include, among others, the preparation of a report or study/ modules/ manuals, writing of an article, translation or editing services, organizing a seminar, and conducting a survey. It should not be used to hire staff, consultants, temporary advisers, buy supplies and equipment, finance construction activities/ fellowship programs, and transfer donor funds to government. The work contracted must be completed in the same calendar year that the work was contracted.

Direct Financial Cooperation (formerly called Local Cost) - under this mode of implementation, WHO provides the cost for activities that otherwise should be borne by government, to strengthen capacities and allow more effective participation towards meeting commitments. The initiatives under DFC include the conduct of national workshops, training and similar activities.

Fellowship - under this mode of implementation, WHO provides award for further study to recommended health workers towards strengthening the capabilities for specific assignments; thus enhancing the development of particular health programme in the country. This maybe in the form of study tour, exposure/orientation, seminar, workshops, symposium or participation to conferences/meetings.

Technical Service Agreement - under this mode of implementation, collaborative research services are provided under contract by an institution to WHO. These are made with institutions that function as WHO collaborating center. Under this agreement, provisions may include salaries of staff (e.g. Research Assistant).

Supplies/Equipment - pertains to the procurement by WHO of supplies/equipment to be utilized in program implementation.

Short Term Consultants - refers to the experts provided by WHO to assist in program implementation

The terms, commonly used in the implementation of the WHO support to the Health Sector, are defined in a document attached as Annex A.
