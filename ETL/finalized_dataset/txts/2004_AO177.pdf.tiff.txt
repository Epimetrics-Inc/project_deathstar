<subject>SUBJECT: Amendment to Administrative Order No. 171, s. 2004 on the Policies and Guidelines to Implement the Relevant Provisions of Republic Act 9257, otherwise known as the “Expanded Senior Citizens Act of 2003”</subject>


<body> 

I. RATIONALE:

The proportion of older population is expected to rise worldwide. In the 1998 World Health Report, there were 390 million older people and this ﬁgure is expected to increase further (WHO) older was 3.7 million in 1995 or 5.4% of total population. In Y2000 census, this has increased to about 4.8 million or almost 6% (NSCB)

With the rise of the aging population is the increase in demand for health services by the elderly. A study done by Racelis et al (2003) on the share of health expenditure of Filipino elderly on the National Health Account, the elderly are "relatively heavy consumers of personal health care (22%) and relatively light consumers of public health care (5%)." From out—of—pocket costs, the aged are heavy users of care provided by hospitals, non-hospital health facilities and traditional care facilities.

Cognizant of the growing concerns of the older population, laws and policies were developed that would provide them with enabling mechanisms for them to have quality life. RA 9257 or the Expanded Senior Citizens’ Act of 2003 provides for the expansion of coverage of beneﬁts and privileges that the elderly may acquire, including medically necessary services. Parallel to this objective is the Department’s desire to provide affordable and quality health service to the marginalized population, especially the elderly, without impeding currently pursued objectives alongside health systems reform.

This guideline is being issued in support to the Implementing Rules and Regulations of RA 9257. Policies and guidelines are discussed to guide the hospitals in implementing the provisions of RA 9257 so asto provide fair, jusf'and quality health. care to the senior population, at the same time pursuing financial viability of hospitals amidst economic and ﬁnancial management constraints.
