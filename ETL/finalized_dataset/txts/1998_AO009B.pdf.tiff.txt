<subject>SUBJECT: Guidelines for Acceptance of Drugs, Medicines,  Reagents, and Other Medical Supplies Relative to the Expiration Date</subject>

<body>
 
I. BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVE: 

The expiration date of drugs and medicines and other medical supplies such as reagents and media is a significant factor which inevitably affects the supply distribution scheme within the various units in the Department of Health. This factor is highlighted especially when date of manufacturing and expiration of these supplies are taken into consideration. As in most cases, there is a gap or a difference in these dates. These date gaps almost always result in indecision - whether to accept or reject supplies - further causing undue delay in the delivery process.

The issue on the prescribed expiration date relative to the deliveries of the different suppliers of this Department has been addressed in general by the Pre-bid and Awards Committee Resolution dated December 27, 1996 (Annex A). However, the resolution was found to be too restrictive and limited since it can not be applied to all items described hereon. For instance, some drugs, reagents, culture media may not be covered with Certificate of Product registration from the Bureau of Food and Drugs which explicitly states the claimed stability.

This order is thereby issued to provide guidelines in the acceptance of said goods. This specifically provides a step-wise approach in decision-making and thus eliminating undue delays.


II. GUIDELINES

1. The ideal or optimal gap between the expiration date and the manufacturing should be explicitly expressed in all contracts and purchase orders relative to the projected date of delivery. The task of determining the ideal range of shelf-life shall be delegated to the different Services and Programs based on previous requisition data, if there is any, and/or from available literature from the Bureau of Food and Drugs or other reputable source. Such action shall be evident in all phases of procurement, from the preparation of Requisition and Issue Voucher for purchasing purposes, to bidding processes and until the delivery process.

2. The provisions of PBAC Resolution dated December 27, 1996 stated as follows shall be general policy that should be applied for in accepting drugs, medicines and the like, as much as possible:

“Expiration date should not be less than two (2) years from the date of manufacture and not less than one and a half (1 1/2) years from the date of delivery”.

3. In cases where the expiration date of the goods is less than that prescribed in NO. 2, the following requisites must be submitted to the Material Management Division, Procurement and Logistics Service three (3) days prior to the scheduled invariable receipt
of goods: 

a) Supplier’s advance copy of Invoice explicitly indicating the Lot Number and Expiration Date and a photocopy of the Purchase Order or Contract.

b) Certification from the Director or Head of the proponent Service/Program explicitly stating therein that such item’s expiration date will be acceptable, will be consumed at least three (3) months prior to expiration date and that no buffer stocks shall be maintained by the same in the Central Office Warehouse, if such will be distributed to the regions. 

c) Approval of the Undersecretary/Assistant Secretary concerned on the actions to be taken by the Proponent Service/Program 

Failure to submit such documents will result into the automatic rejection of the goods.


IV. EFFECTIVITY

This Administrative Order shall be effective on March 16, 1998.
