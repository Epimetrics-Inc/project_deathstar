<subject>SUBJECT: Guidelines In The Implementation Of Oral Health Program For Public Health Services</subject>

<body>
I. RATIONALE/BACKGROUND

In the Philippines, the main oral health problems are dental caries (tooth decay) and periodontal disease (gum disease). These two oral diseases are so widespread that 92% of our people are suffering from tooth decay and 78.0 % have gum disease. These diseases outrank the top Philippine illness picture of acute respiratory infection and gastro-intestinal diseases. This does not mention yet, crooked teeth, mal-relation of the jaws, cancer of the oral cavity and others. No community in the Philippines is free from dental diseases.

In terms of DMFT (decayed, missing, filled teeth) Index, Philippines ranked second worst among 21 WHO Western Pacific countries. Dental caries and periodontal disease are observed to be significantly more prevalent in rural than urban areas. This is not surprising considering that in a survey among the members of the Philippine Dental Association in 1998, 88.4 percent of respondent dentists claimed that their practice were based in urban areas, 10.9 percent were in suburban centers while only 0.7 percent were in a rural location. However, the prevalence of dental caries and periodontal disease are also high in urban areas.

The combined ill effects of these two major diseases although not considered killer diseases (except oral cancer) weaken bodily defense and serve as portal of entry to other more serious, potentially dangerous and opportunistic infections overlapping other diseases present. Such will incapacitate a young victim as in crippling heart conditions arising from oral infection that may end in death.

While dental diseases are viewed only as an indirect threat to life, much less seen only as an incapacitating illness, in terms of morbidity, it tops all other diseases. The preservation of health and prolongation of life although considered the most significant concern of all health efforts is only a part of the broad objectives of the health services. The major goal of our government is to provide opportunities for every Filipino to work at full capacity towards the fulfillment of a purposely healthy and productive life. It is along this area that oral health can visibly contribute its share. Oral health service is a basic health service and an unqualified component of the total health efforts. Good oral health is said to be the most visible indicator of health of an individual, the family, the community or the whole nation.

Oral Health as it relates to the total health takes the least priority of an individual. The level of oral health awareness has not reached the stage where the knowledge of basic oral health measures, as it affects his overall health, is transmitted in terms of positive action. People still accept tooth decay and gum diseases with resigned tolerance as a natural occurrence rather than take that extra step to prevent it. Yet oral diseases are preventable with technology already available to lessen the problem.

The individual with an oral health problem is complacent in the sense that he does not need to worry very much about it for very rarely would tooth decay contributes directly to death. However, its chronic nature is insidious and does not sound any alarm sufficient to motivate him to work and take precautions until intense toothache, swelling of the face and fever overcomes the individual. Decayed, crooked and missing teeth are observed by many as merely physical deformities or simply a disability. The individual so affected with such handicap also has a disturbed speech, becomes withdrawn and avoids socializing with people and so lessens his opportunities for advancement. More critical however is the effect of poor or defective teeth to overall nutrition to maintain good general health, that begins with the first bite and chewing the food efficiently.

The delivery of basic oral health care became the responsibility of the local government units under the Local Government Code of 1991. Although, oral health program was given its own limited budget, it cannot meet the perceived oral health needs and treatment demands of the entire populace. Oral health is inadequately integrated into the national health care system of the country and there is currently no sustainable basic oral care service being adopted. To have a better chance of providing a more sustainable approach in the delivery of oral health care for the Filipinos, oral health should be upgraded and integrated with other family health programs. It shall be a basic health component of the family and shall link with other family health programs such as maternal and child health, nutrition, reproductive health, and now communicable diseases.

II. OBJECTIVE:

This Administrative Order provides the guidelines for the implementation of the national oral health program for public health services. This will also be the basis for planning and implementing various oral health programs and projects in the country, and for effective and efficient supervision and coordination with the total public health services of the Department of Health and all government and non-government agencies.

III. COVERAGE

This Administrative Order shall cover all public health services under the Department of Health (DOH) and Local Government Units (LGUs) health facilities to include hospital and health centers, at all levels (National, Regional, Provincial/City, Municipal/Rural and Barangay.).

E. Technical Assistance - is defined as the process of guiding, helping, training and motivating health workers to improve their performance in order to provide high quality health services

V. PROGRAM OBJECTIVES

General:

Reduction on the prevalence rate of dental caries and periodontal diseases from 92% in 1998 to 85% and from 78% in 1998 to 60%, respectively, by end of 2010 among general population

Specific:

a) To increase the proportion of Orally Fit Children (OFC) under 6 years old to 80% by 2010

b) To control oral health risks among the young people

c) To improve the oral health conditions of pregnant women by 20% and older persons by 10% every year until 2010

VI. GENERAL GUIDELINES AND PROCEDURES

A. Health Service Delivery

1. Type, Scope of Service and Measures/Interventions

a. Preventive

Preventive Services consist of the following measures which will promote oral health and provide specific protection from the occurrence of dental caries and other oral diseases:

• Oral Examination/ Case Finding

Oral examination is the careful checking up of the oral cavity by duly trained dentist to detect and diagnose oral diseases and conditions, with the use of a plain mouth mirror and explorer under good natural daylight or with the use of artificial light and diagnostic facilities or equipment such as x-ray and pulp tester and other special laboratory examination when available. Oral examination can detect signs and symptoms of Sexually Transmitted Diseases-AIDS and other non-communicable chronic diseases such as diabetes.

A trained dental aide records all conditions and findings as dictated by the dentist, in an Individual Treatment Record Form (Form 1). This serves as the permanent record of the patient.

The diagnosis and findings recorded in the Individual Treatment Record, in the absence of survey results, shall serve as source of information / basis for baseline data or program planning and comparison of accomplishments or achievements.

• Oral Hygiene Program

Oral hygiene is a basic personal measure to prevent and control tooth decay and gum disease. It includes among others oral prophylaxis, regular and proper way of toothbrushing, gum massage, eating detersive foods (singkamas, guava, apple and the likes) and the use of mouthwashes.

> Oral prophylaxis includes scaling the calcular deposits, polishing and mechanical cleansing of the teeth to smoothen rough surfaces and to remove stains with the use of prophylactic brush or rubber cup and prophylactic powder / paste. Priority for oral prophylaxis are pregnant women and children.

> Daily Supervised Toothbrushing Drill

As a component of the preventive oral health program based at the school facilities, daily supervised toothbrushing drill among pre-schoolchildren should be carried out. The daily toothbrushing drill is done following recess time either in the classroom or "en masse" where the children are assembled at the school ground to be supervised initially by the Public Health Dentist and later on by their respective teachers. This activity can be extended to elementary school children upon request by school authorities or local government executives. (Refer to Annex-A for the Specific Guidelines of Supervised Toothbrushing Drill)

• Pit and Fissure Sealant Program

A non-invasive preventive and control measure against tooth decay for children is the pit and fissure sealant. Fluoride therapy is best for smooth surfaces but is limited where grinding surfaces are concerned owing to the presence of pit and fissures on the surfaces. (Refer to Annex-B for the Specific Guidelines for the Pit and Fissure Program)

• Fluoride Utilization Program

In areas where the fluoride content of drinking water is low or nil, non-invasive preventive and control measures through multiple use of fluorides is encouraged such as:

> Use of fluorides through systemic route.

Fluoridation of reticulated community and school water system is advocated. Where water fluoridation is not feasible, the utilization of fluoride tablets shall be advocated.

> Use of fluoride through local route.

Topical application of fluorides such as self-applied mouthrinses and fluoridated toothpastes shall be promoted and advocated for school aged children.

b. Curative/Treatment Services and Interventions

These are remedial measures applied to halt the progress of oral disease process and restore the sound condition of the teeth and supporting tissues.

• Permanent Filling - the restoration of savable teeth with amalgam, composite or glass ionomer filling materials.

• Gum Treatment - deep scaling and root planing of affected tooth or teeth for pregnant mothers and older person with periodontal disease.

• Atraumatic Restorative Treatment (ART) - one form of permanent filling for priority target groups by manually cleaning dental cavities using hand instruments and filling the cavities with fluoride releasing glass ionomer restorative materials

• Temporary Filling - treatment of deep-seated tooth decay with zinc oxide and eugenol

• Extraction - removal of unsavable teeth to control foci of infection; provision/prescription of antibiotics when necessary

• Treatment of post extraction complication such as dry sockets and bleeding

• Drainage of localized oral abscesses - incision and drainage

c. Promotive Services

Promotion of oral health includes health education activities directed to the priority groups thru individual or group approach, using accepted tools and media. This includes education for oral health of preschool children, referrals and follow-up, community organization for endeavors in oral health of preschool children, etc. Good oral hygiene helps promote healthy gums. Activities in health education, therefore, should include teaching proper techniques of toothbrushing through teachers, health workers and mothers, using motivational forces such as: cleanliness of mouth, freshness of breath, beautiful smile. These motivational messages will lead to behavioral change at a young age. Enforcement of behavior can be supported by helping the children to buy toothbrushes/toothpaste at minimum cost and dedicating appropriate place and time to do toothbrushing at home or in school.

Methods Utilized in Information, Education and Communication (IEC).

• One-on-one communication - every patient seeking dental treatment or consultation shall be provided with a thorough instructions on the services rendered and corresponding follow-up and home care

• Group presentations of information and group discussion and decision-making, examples - schools or community meetings, seminars, workshops, mother's classes, orientation courses, etc.

• Community organizational strategies, such as forming committees to solve local problems, holding meetings for professional and / or the public to generate interest in solving problems, working with community leaders to commit available resources to a programme or assisting with or organizing community surveys of oral health needs.

• Disseminating information through mass communication channels, including the use of pamphlets, posters, newspapers, leaflets, newsletters, radio and television.

The oral health practices that shall be vigorously promoted and advocated at all levels are the following:

> Promotion of Balanced Diet

The development of sound teeth of an individual begins while still in the womb of the mother and continues through childhood and throughout life. The promotion of balanced diet shall be done primarily among pregnant and lactating women and other age groups.

> Correct Eating Habits in Children

Correct eating habits shall be promoted to young children starting from infancy. Exclusive breastfeeding from birth up to six months and continue breastfeeding up to two years with timely, adequate and safe complementary foods starting at six months shall be advocated.

> Practice Good Oral Hygiene

The practice of self care for oral health such as toothbrushing or vigorous rinsing of the mouth after meals shall be promoted

> Periodic Visit to the Dentist

The visit to the dentist shall be encouraged among young children as soon as the first tooth erupts (normally 6 months old and every six months thereafter). Unprevented oral diseases in later age group shall be subjected to early diagnosis and treatment.

e. Risk Behavior Education/Counseling - oral diseases has been associated with cardiovascular disease, diabetes and stroke. Education/counseling on good hygiene, diet, and adverse effect of tobacco smoking, drugs and alcohol to oral health and the general health of young people (adolescent and youth)

• Advise on ill effects of tobacco smoking, drugs, alcohol, carbonated and high sugar beverages, softdrinks and fruit juices

• Inform women of child bearing age about the potential harm (congenital defects such as cleft lip and palate) to children whose mothers use tobacco during pregnancy.

• Build patient interest in tobacco cessation by showing actual ill effects of tobacco in the mouth

f. Oral Health Instruction/Advice - oral or written advice given to the patient concurrent with oral treatment or Consultation and includes information to promote oral health. It also includes pre and post-operative instruction and advice to achieve full cooperation of patient with regards to the dental treatment given.

2. Basic Package of Oral Health Care - Lifecycle Approach

The following are the basic package of essential oral health services/care for every lifecycle group to be provided either in health facilities, schools or at home.

<image>table_3.png</image>

** Targeted Groups

3. Oral Health Program In Far-flung Hard to Reach and Urban Poor Communities

One effective approach to deliver basic services to the unserved and underserved population of the country to ensure equal access of basic oral health care is the conduct of reaching out (outreach) programs or activities. This outreach activity is one of the components of the LGU oral health program for the far-flung, hard to reach and urban poor communities.

Effective outreach must be well planned, organized and supported. Several strategies can be employed to maximize limited resources. The following should be considered:

a) Outreach activities should be conducted on a scheduled and regular basis and shall be included in the detailed and approved provincial/city/municipal plan of action. Scheduling of visits will permit to reach all targeted and. prioritized communities in a year.

b) Prioritizing municipalities, barangays or communities should be based on the following:

- Communities with high (higher than the set objectives) prevalence of oral diseases especially dental caries and periodontal disease
- Communities with low dental clinic visits/attendance in the health center
- Hard to reach location of the community - marginalized and far-flung areas
- No public health dentist in the area
- Urban poor communities

c) Provide each patient with Individual Treatment Record (Form 1) as basis for recording and reporting oral health status, diseases and services rendered

d) Promotive, preventive and curative services to be provided should meet the needs of the community

e) The outreach activity shall be integrated with other health activities such as immunization, nutrition activities, medical-surgical clinics, during Garantisadong Pambata activities and during barangay health days. These strategies help avoid over dependence on external funding and share cost with other programs.

f) Local health workers such as the Barangay Dental Auxiliaries (BDAs) and Barangay Health Workers (BHWs) play an important role in increasing awareness and providing information to the community. Individual volunteers and community-based groups can also be tapped to assist in this effort.

4. Referral and Follow-up

Other oral health needs requiring treatment not within the scope of the service as enumerated in this Guideline such as Root Canal Treatment, Maxillo-Oral Surgery, Orthodontics, Prosthodontics and the likes shall be referred to other health facilities or private practitioners. It shall be the duty of the public health dentist, however, to see to it that patients thus referred actually received the treatment they need through an effective referral and follow-up system.

The following should be considered:

a. Referrals may be done through any of the following:

• In health facilities without Public Health Dentists, the Rural Health Midwife (RHM) or Barangay Health Worker/Volunteer (BHWN) or Barangay dental Auxiliaries (BDAs) from the community or from the Barangay Health Station shall refer patients to the Main Health Center or directly to the hospital or any private health facilities

• In health facilities with Public Health Dentists but with no capability to treat the patient because of lack of equipment/logistics or cases with complications, the Public Health Dentist shall refer patient to other health centers or hospital or any private health facilities

• Hospital dentists shall refer patient to other hospital or any private health facilities in case of limited capability to provide the needed services

b. Patients must be given neceSsary emergency treatment prior to referral to another health facility.

c. A "referral slip" should be prepared which should contain the following information (Refer to Annex - C for the Referral Slip):

• Name and age of the client/patient
• Date and time of referral
• Description of the client problem
• Reasons for referral
• Emergency treatment that has been given prior to referral or any medicines given such as paracetamol for pain relief
• Other important health information that the referral health facility needs to know such as earlier treatment, medical or dental history.

d. A "return-referral" slip should also be given to the patient together with the referral note to include the following information (Refer to Annex - C for the Return Referral Slip):

• Name and age of the client/patient
• Date and time of Treatment
• Diagnosis and treatment given
• Home care and follow-up care

e. Filled-up Return-Referral form should be given back to the referring health unit/facility for follow-up care

f. Records on the status of patient referrals and follow-up must be maintained at the Hospital/Main Health Center/Barangay Health Station

B. Support Component

1. Capability Building

Improving skills of dental public health personnel should be done in order to prepare them to perform their job well. This can be achieved through formal and informal training programs and activities, and is aimed at:

a) Objectives

• Strengthen the treatment and management capabilities/skills of personnel rendering oral health care; and,

• Improve the conduct of health promotion strategies in health facilities, community or at home

b) Types of Training Programs

• Orientation courses for new employees and newly promoted personnel to carry out their functions efficiently and effectively.

• In-service training courses required for supervisory positions, and these shall be developed and conducted from time to time to meet training needs.

• Training on Management of Oral Health Programs to enable dental staff at all levels to understand the Program Mission, Vision and Goal; Program Policies, Objectives and Indicators; Oral Health Program Strategic Framework and components; and the Monitoring and evaluation schemes

• Special Training for dentists preparing for special assignments as dental epidemiologist, researchers, educators, training officers, dental health statisticians, dental specialties, etc., the arrangements shall be made with the particular agencies offering special training courses such as Statistical Center, University of the Philippines, Health Human Resource Development Bureau of the DOH, College of Public Health, U.P., etc.

• Graduate Education for dentists preparing for promotion and assignments as administrators / managers of dental public health programs should undergo academic preparations leading to degree of Masters of Public Health or other related degrees.

• Continuing Education of Staff to provide opportunities for dental personnel to keep them continuously abreast with up-to-date knowledge and technology by:

> Updating clinical skills, techniques and methods through short course training, workshop, seminars, consultative and professional meetings;

> Provision of observation study tour to update knowledge on preventive dentistry and dental specialties through fellowship grants;

> Provision of training for personnel development and growth such as personnel management, civil service laws and regulations, programs for executive development, etc. in coordination with the Civil Service Commission, Development Academy of the Philippine and other related agencies.

2. Health Promotion and Advocacy

Various communication strategies shall be developed to promote desirable oral health practices. The National Center for Disease Prevention and Control in coordination with the National Center for Health Promotion, both of the Department of Health, will develop communication strategies for adoption at the national, local and private health facilities.

The oral health related strategies/activities along the five (5) action areas of health promotion, will be as follows:

Build Healthy Public Policy

a) Lobby to local chief executives formulation of enabling local ordinances and resolutions and allocate funds for implementation of basic oral health care packages

b) Develop a proposal to study special oral health care financing package for marginalized population/communities e.g. indigenous people, urban poor

Create Supportive Environments

a) Create a national, provincial, municipal multi-sectoral Technical Working Group (DOH, DSWD, DepEd, LGUs, PDA and other civic and religious organizations) and forge agreements in the conduct of oral health activities.

b) Integrate the concept of oral health in the healthy school/community settings criteria.

c) Mobilize other sectors to support health education and treatment activities or adopt a community, school or day care center.

d) Utilize available resources (manpower) of partner agencies (PDA/Dental Societies, other health professionals (physicians, nurses, midwifes, BHW and volunteers) in oral health promotion

Strengthen Community Action

a) Plan and implement an annual local campaign for oral health

b) Organize a local inter-sectoral group to initiate planning and implementation of programs and projects on oral health

Develop Personal Skills

a) Develop and integrate dental health messages for mothers and children to general health promotion and education activities

b) Integrate the "Orally Fit Child" concept, messages and indicators in the maternal and child health and nutrition programs and campaigns

c) Develop oral health training modules for other frontline health workers (BHW, Midwifes) and teachers

d) Develop, produce and distribute Information, Education and Communication (IEC) materials in various formats and through various channels, such as print, radio/TV, internet

e) Conduct individual or group health teaching during:

• Toothbrushing drills
• Dental/oral check-up and treatment
• Immunization Day
• Pre-natal check-up
• Garantisadong Pambata

f) Conduct convention and fora to orient and update public health dentists and other health workers on the oral health program

Reorienting Health Services

a) Formulate/develop standards, guidelines and protocols and tools for oral health such as basic oral health packages, monitoring tools and etc.

b) Monitor and evaluate oral health promotion activities

3. Monitoring and Evaluation

If careful planning has occurred, then implementation only involves translating the plans into action. However, enthusiastic initiation is the easiest part of operational phase of a program; the most difficult part is to maintain the enthusiasm at an acceptable level to achieve beneficial oral health outcomes. Many new programs are enthusiastically initiated each year, but interest declines as time passes because there is lack of adequate follow-through plans. Therefore, a program must be monitored systematically if its objectives are to be achieved. Listed below are activities for consideration.

1. Conference with dentists and other health officials at all levels on the activities, problems and constraints encountered in the implementation.

2. Field visit and interview of people to determine their acceptance regarding the program / project and know whether they appreciate the benefits of the service.

3. Review and analysis of consolidated accomplished evaluation tools indicators and assess their usage to determine the progress, efficiency, effectiveness and impacts of the program / projects.

4. Plan frequency of monitoring and schedule of evaluation

5. Define alternative plan of action for redirection of activities if deemed necessary.

6. Establish a surveillance system for measuring progress in the control of dental caries and periodontal disease and the promotion of oral health

Example of parameters/indicators for program evaluation

Orally Fit Child Program

1. Human resources assigned and capability building activities provided for implementors (Public Health dentists/Teachers/Volunteers Health Workers, etc.)

2. Financial resources allocated for essential drugs, supplies and materials

3. Frequency of visits by supervisors (regional/provincial)

4. Program/project activities, outputs, outcomes, impacts such as:

a. Oral Health Status (baseline versus current)
b. Awareness of the program and utilization of services (individual, family and community)
c. Services and frequency rendered (Toothbrushing, ART, OUT)
d. Health education activities for the child and caregivers (Toothbrushing technique, nutrition, etc)

4. Collaboration and Linkages

Critical to the successful implementation and sustenance of the oral health program is the commitment and full cooperation of partners in the government and non-governments agencies, organizations and private sectors.

All levels of public health services should establish/build partnership with these groups e.g. DOH Offices, Department of Interior and Local Government/Local Government Units, Department of Education, Department of Social Welfare and Development and Other Government Agencies, Non-Government Organizations such as the Philippine Dental association and its Chapter Societies and Affiliates, Academe, Professional Groups, Media and the private sectors particularly local and foreign funding agencies.

Plans should be developed for continuing technical and administrative support to the implementing levels for sustained action.

They shall be partners in advocacy, promotion and provision of oral health services and in the training of oral health care professionals and auxiliaries.

A memorandum of understanding should be forged to strengthen coordination and linkages with the above partner agencies.

5. Integration to Other Health Programs

Specific approaches and concepts of the oral health program should be integrated in other health programs such as in nutrition, maternal and child health, women's health and safe motherhood, adolescent, youth and elderly program, other non-communicable disease programs such as healthy lifestyle, tobacco and drug abuse programs, water and sanitation programs among others.

The following are some health programs with direct link to oral health which can be used in the promotion of good oral health practices:

• Infant and Young Child Feeding Program (IYCF) - Among other important benefits of breastfeeding, breast milk prevents the occurrence of rampant early childhood caries (baby-bottle feeding caries). Baby-bottle feeding caries is caused by frequent and prolong exposure of the teeth to sugar and is often the result of a child going to bed with a bottle of a sweetened drink or drinking at will from a bottle during the day.

• Nutrition program - eating well-balanced and nutritious foods promotes good oral health. Unhealthy diet such as frequent sugar consumption is a risk factor to oral health resulting to the development of dental caries;

• Healthy Lifestyle/Adolescent and Youth Health Program - Excessive consumption of alcohol and tobacco is a risk factor to oral health that may result to oral cancer; Tobacco smoking is also a risk factor resulting to adult periodontal diseases and congenital defects such as cleft lip and palate.

• Maternal and Child Health - integrate dental check-up, tooth brushing and the basic health services during Garantisadong Pambata (GP), Bright Child, Safe Motherhood and other health activities and programs.

• Other health programs such as women's and older persons programs - integrate the basic oral health care and other health education and promotion activities in the general health program or during specific events such as women's months, elderly week, safe motherhood week and others

6. Technical Supervision and Assistance

Technical supervision of dental service in regional, provincial, city health offices shall include among others the following:

1. Determine the needs and problems and recommend remedial measures to help solve the problems

2. Compliance with the policies, standards and guidelines of the Department of Health

3. Technical assistance and advice in the development, implementation and evaluation of oral health programs.

4. Promotion of training and staff development programs for dental personnel and volunteers.

5. Attainment of goals and objectives.

6. To achieve optimum levels of quality of oral health programs

7. Application of follow-up measures to ensure compliance of recommendations made during previous monitoring or supervision visits. This shall also include follow-up activities after training

C. Recording and Reporting
