<body>

I. RATIONALE/BACKGROUND 

In response to the World Health Organization (WHO) declaration of global pandemic of the Inﬂuenza A(H1N1) virus on June 2009, the Department of Health (DOH) through the Bureau of Health Facility Development (then the National Center for Health Facility Development) as per Department Personnel Order No. 2009-2441 initiated the establishment of ﬁve (5) Sub-national and Regional Laboratories for the detection and conﬁrmation of Inﬂuenza A(H1N1). 

These Sub-national Laboratories (SNLS) include the Baguio General Hospital and Medical Center, San Lazaro Hospital, and Lung Center of the Philippines for Luzon, Vicente Sotto Memorial Medical Center in collaboration with the US Armed Forces Research Institute of Medical Sciences (US—AFRIMS) for Visayas, and Southern Philippines Medical Center formerly Davao Medical Center for Mindanao. 

The purpose of the establishment of these SNLs is to assist the Research Institute for Tropical Medicine Philippine National Inﬂuenza Center (RITM-PNIC) in the timely and accurate detection and conﬁrmation of pandemic Inﬂuenza A(H1N1) using Realtime Polymerase Chain Reaction (realtime PCR). In the post pandemic (inﬂuenza inter- pandemic) period, however, the SNLs no longer performed regular testing, leading to inconsistent performance in the proﬁciency panels sent by the RITM. 

In recent years, important infections are emerging, such as the MERS-Coronavirus, Avian Inﬂuenza A(H7N9), and Ebola Virus Disease (EVD), aside from the re-emergence and outbreaks of infectious diseases of public health importance, such as Dengue and Measles, among others. The DOH recognizes that a strong network of functional laboratories is more efﬁcient than centralized testing to provide timely and accurate laboratory services for surveillance and response. 

II. OBJECTIVES 

A. General Objective The ofﬁcial recognition of existing subnational laboratories (SNLs) to provide support to surveillance under the Department of Health Epidemiology Bureau (EB), augmented response to the Research Institute for Tropical Medicine— Philippine National Inﬂuenza Center (RITM-PNIC) during pandemics, outbreaks and emergence of novel respiratory pathogens, and recommendations to the DOH  

Disease Prevention and Control Bureau (DPCB) for management, prevention and control guidelines. 

B. Specific Objective 

1. To recognize the Baguio General Hospital and Medical Center, San Lazaro Hospital, Lung Center of the Philippines, Vicente Sotto Memorial Medical Center in collaboration with US-AFRIMS, and Southern Philippines Medical Center as the country’s subnational laboratories. 

2. To provide guidelines on the terms of reference, duties and responsibilities, and operationalization of the SNLs, including interface with other agencies and stakeholders to ensure sustainability for continued operations. 

III. SCOPE/COVERAGE 

This Administrative Order covers the ofﬁcial recognition of the SNLs, their updated mandates, tasks and responsibilities, and the provisions required for their continued operations and sustainability. 

IV. DEFINITION OF TERMS 

1. Disease surveillance - The systematic, continuing assessment of the health of a community, based on the collection, interpretation and use of health data. Surveillance provides information necessary for public health decision-making. 

2. Emerging respiratory - Respiratory infections caused by either the emergence of infections new subtypes or variants of known pathogens or emergence of newly identiﬁed or unknown pathogens, with a potential to impact public health signiﬁcantly; See Novel respiratory infections. 

3. Inﬂuenza epidemic - An outbreak of inﬂuenza caused by inﬂuenza A or B viruses that have undergone antigenic drift. The terms “inﬂuenza epidemic” and “inﬂuenza outbreak” have the same meaning, and may occur locally or in many parts of the world during the same season. 

4. Inﬂuenza pandemic - By convention, worldwide outbreaks of inﬂuenza caused by inﬂuenza A viruses that have undergone antigenic shift. A pandemic is a global disease outbreak. A ﬂu pandemic occurs when a new inﬂuenza virus emerges for which people have little or no immunity and for which there is no vaccine. The disease spreads easily person-to-person, causes serious illness, and can sweep across the country and around the world in very short time. 

5. Inﬂuenza Inter-Pandemic Period
-The inﬂuenza inter-pandemic period has two phases. In Phase 1 no new inﬂuenza virus subtypes have been detected in humans; the inﬂuenza virus subtype that has caused human infection may be present in animals, but the risk of human infection or disease is considered to be low. In Phase 2, although no new inﬂuenza virus subtypes have been detected in humans, there is a circulating animal inﬂuenza virus (e subtype posing a substantial risk of human disease. \r} Q7 


6. Inﬂuenza virological surveillance- The ongoing and systematic collection and analysis of surveillance inﬂuenza viruses in order to monitor their characteristics. 

7. National Inﬂuenza - Are institutions recognized by the World Health Centers (NICs) Organization to perform inﬂuenza virological surveillance. These NICs collect specimens in their country, perform primary virus isolation and preliminary antigenic characterization. They also ship newly isolated strains to WHO Collaborating Center for high level antigenic and genetic analysis, the result of which forms the basis for WHO recommendations on the composition of inﬂuenza vaccine for the Northern and Southern Hemisphere each year. In the Philippines, the NIC is the Research Institute for Tropical Medicine (RITM). 

8. Novel respiratory infections - Respiratory infections caused by either the emergence of infections new subtypes or variants of known pathogens or emergence of newly identiﬁed or unknown pathogens, with a potential to impact public health signiﬁcantly; See Emerging respiratory infections. 

9. Polymerase Chain - A powerful, molecular technique for the identiﬁcation of Reaction inﬂuenza virus genomes even when they are present at very low levels. 

10. Severe Acute Respiratory Infection (SARI) Surveillance- Virologic surveillance for the severe end of the spectrum of Inﬂuenza disease with capacity to detect new subtypes of 
inﬂuenza, as well as respiratory infections due to novel or emerging viruses 

11.Subnational Laboratory (SNL) - Laboratories capable of performing realtime PCR testing, established by the DOH during the pandemic Inﬂuenza AH1N1 (2009) to augment the response of RITM
