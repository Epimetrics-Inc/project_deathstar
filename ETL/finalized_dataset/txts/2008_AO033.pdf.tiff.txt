<body>
I. Rationale 

On 23 April 2002, Administrative Order (AO) No. 103 series of 2002 was issued to effectively implement the provision of Republic Act No. 3720 as amended by Executive Order No. 175 or the Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, as well as, Republic Act No. 7394 or the Consumer Act of the Philippines requiring the batch certification, prior to the release for sale or distribution, of a batch of drugs which purport to be, or is represented as a drug composed wholly or partly of insulin or of any kind of penicillin, streptomycin, chlortetracycline, chloramphenicol, bacitracin, or any other antibiotic drug or any derivative thereof. The same Administrative Order, consistent with the above—cited laws, provided for the exemption from the requirement of batch certification with certain exceptions (conditions). 

Recently, Republic Act No. 9502, otherwise known as the “Universally Accessible Cheaper and Quality Medicines Act of 2008" and its implementing Rules and Regulations (lRR) were enacted. One of the objectives under the said law is to ensure adequate access to quality and affordable drugs and medicines. It is, thus, imperative to redefine the conditions set forth under Administrative Order No. 103 series of 2002 to align to the above objective. ' 

Hence, this Order is issued redefining the rules and conditions in exempting antibiotic drug product(s) from the batch certification requirement and for other purposes. 

The issuance of this Order is further reinforced by the legal mandate, which is hereby adopted as a policy, that in case of drugs, pharmaceuticals or poisons sold in their original packings, the seal of which has not been broken or tampered with, the liability that may arise because of their quality and purity, rests upon the manufacturer or in its absence, upon the importer, the distributor, representative or dealer who is responsible for their distribution or sale. 

II. Authority/ Basis 

This Order is issued by virtue of the authority provided under Section 22 (b) and (c) of Republic Act No. 3720 as amended by Executive Order No. 175, and Article 34 (b) and (c) of Republic Act No. 7394, which authorize the Secretary of Health to promulgate regulations exempting antibiotic drug or class of such drugs from the requirements of batch certification whenever in his judgment such requirement is not necessary to insure safety and efficacy of use and good quality. 

III. Objective 

This Order is issued to: (i) redefine the exemption of antibiotic drug product(s) from the requirement of batch certification as laid down under AO No. 103 series 2002 to align to the objective of ensuring adequate access to quality and affordable drugs and medicines; (ii) provide for the rules and conditions in exempting antibiotic drug product/s from the batch certification requirement; (iii) prescribe the guidelines for the implementation of the exemptidn from batch certification and remedies and sanctions in case of infringement of this Order; (iv) provide for remedies and sanctions in the event that this Order is infringed.
