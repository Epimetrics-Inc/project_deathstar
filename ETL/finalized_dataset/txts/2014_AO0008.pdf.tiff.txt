I. RATIONALE/ BACKGROUND 

The right to health is one of the fundamental rights enshrined in Article II of the Constitution. Section 15 states that “the State shall protect and promote the right to health of the people and instill health consciousness among them."

Under Republic Act (RA) No. 7394 or the Consumer Act of the Philippines, “It is the policy of the State to protect the interest of the consumer, promote his general welfare andto establish standards of conduct for business and industry. Towards this end, the State shall implement measures to achieve the following objectives: a) Protection against hazards to health and safety; b) Protection against deceptive, unfair and unconscionable sales acts and practice; c) Provision of information and education to facilitate sound choice and the proper exercise of rights by consumer.” Article 10, on Injurious, Dangerous and Unsafe Products, of the same RA provides that, “Whenever the departments find, by their own initiative or by petition of a consumer, that a consumer product is found to be injurious, unsafe and dangerous, it shall, after due notice and hearing, make the appropriate order for its recall, prohibition 'or seizure from public sale or distribution. Provided that, in the sound discretion of the Department it may declare a consumer product to be imminently injurious, unsafe or dangerous, and order its immediate recall, ban or seizure from public sale or distribution, in which case the seller, distributor, manufacturer or producer thereof shall be afforded a hearing within forty-eight (48) hours from such order.” 

Section 3 of RA No. 9711 or the FDA Act of 2009 declares that, “It is hereby declared a policy of the State to adopt, support, establish, institutionalize, improve and maintain structures, processes, mechanisms and initiative that are aimed, directed and designed to protect and promote the right to health of the Filipino people.” Section 5 of the FDA Act of 2009 provides that, “Section 4 of RA No. 3720, as amended, is hereby further amended to read as follows: Sec. 4. To carry out the provisions of this Act, there is hereby created an office to be called the Food and Drug Administration. (FDA) in the Department of Health (DOH). Said administration shall be under the Office of the Secretary and shall have the following functions, powers and duties: xxx (k) After due process, to order the ban, recall, and/or withdrawal of any health product found to have caused the death, serious illness or serious injury to the consumer or patient, or is found. to be imminently injurious, unsafe, dangerous, or grossly deceptive, and to require all concerned to implement the risk management plan which is a requirement for the issuance of the appropriate authorization.” 


The WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco Control was ratiﬁed by the Republic of the Philippines in 2005 and entered into force on 4 September 2005. Speciﬁcally, under Article 5 on the General Obligations, Article 5.3 states that, “In setting and implementing their public health policies with respect to tobacco "control, Parties shall act to protect these policies from commercial and other vested interests of the tobacco industry in accordance with national law.” 

RA No. 9711 deﬁnes ’health products’ as food, drugs, cosmetics, devices, biologicals, vaccines, in-vitro diagnostic reagents and household/urban hazardous substances and/or a combination of and/or a derivative thereof. It shall also refer to products that may have an effect on health which require regulations as determined by the FDA. It also deﬁnes ‘health- related device’ as any device not directly used in health care but has been determined by the FDA to adversely affect the health of the people. As the national competent authority on health products and health-related device, the FDA has put in place systems and processes for licensing the establishments, issuing market authorization for products, approving labels and labeling materials, conducting inspection and post-marketing surveillance, approval of promotional and advertisement materials, and laboratory testing. 

The World Health Organization has clearly stated that the safety and efficacy of ENDS or electronic cigarettes as smoking cessation aid have not yet been scientifically demonstrated. The potential risks they pose for the health of users remain undetermined. WHO stated that “until such time as a given ENDS is deemed safe and effective and of acceptable quality by a competent national regulatory body, consumers should be strongly advised not to use electronic nicotine delivery systems including e—cigarettes.” 

Electronic cigarette or ENDS products and. its manufacturers and distributors are hereby regulated to ensure protection of the safety and welfare of consumers. The timely and appropriate regulation of ENDS or electronic cigarettes underscores the primacy of public health and re affirms its primary function to promote, protect, preserve, and restore the health of the people.
