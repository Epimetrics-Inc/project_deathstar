<subject>SUBJECT Requirement of Permit to Construct in the Establishment of Free-standing Screening Drug Testing Laboratories Nationwide</subject>


<body>
I. BACKGROUND AND RATIONALEI:

Pursuant to Republic Act 9165 otherwise known as the “Comprehensive Dangerous Drugs Act of 2002" and its Implementing Rules and Regulations (IRR) and as speciﬁed in the Manual of Operations for Drug Testing Laboratories in the Philippines,- the Department of Health (DOH) is mandated to oversee and monitor the integration coordination and supervision of all drug rehabilitation, intervention after-care and follow— up programs, projects and activities as well as the establishment operation maintenance - and management of privately- -owned drug treatment rehabilitation centers and drug testing networks and laboratories throughout the country, in coordination with other government agencies. Moreover, the responsibility of the DOH, through its principal regulatory oftice, the Bureau of Health Facilities and Services (BHFS) is to accredit drug testing laboratories in order to assure quality, competence and integrity in the conduct of drug testing. 

The East Avenue Medical Center (EAMC) is designated by the Secretary of Health as the National Reference Laboratory (NRL) for Environmental and Occupational Health, Toxicology and Micronutrient Assay. The NRL in coordination with the BHFS shall assure the competence, integrity and stability of drug testing centers nationwide. 

Furthermore, the BHFS is mandated to formulate and establish the standards fOr. regulation of hospitals, clinics and other health facilities and to enforce standards that shall be the basis of' Issuance of license/accreditation of a facility. In accordance with this mandate, the BHFS shall undertake the following tasks : - ' 

1. Develop policies and guidelines on the establishment operation-and monitoring of drug testing laboratories; 
2. Conduct accreditation of all private and government drug testing laboratories 
3. Conduct training of DOH regulatory officers, ' 
4. Conduct research and development on drug testing and other related activities. 

In pursuit of the Said mandate, specifically on the accreditation of Drug Testing Laboratories (or DTL’ s) nationwide, the BHFS will officially prescribe the requirement of DOH Permit to Construct (or DOH- PTC) for all new applications including transfer of site . and change in ownership in the establishment of freestanding Screening Drug Testing Laboratories (SDTL), both government and privately owned, in a countrywide coverage. In addition, the BHFS shall officially require the said appliCation for a DOH PTC and its subsequent apprOval as a prerequisite prior to the application for accreditatiOn by the freestanding SDTL. Concurrent to this, the BHFS is also authorized to set fees and charges by just and reasonable rates to cover the cost of services rendered and partly to support and to Sustain the needed reforms' In health regulation. 

Lastly, in consonance with the above specific tasks such as conduct of research and development on drug testing and other related activities among others, the BHFS has embarked on the development of prototype plan/s for a freestanding SDTL with the accompanying technical guidelines and specifications. 

II. OBJECTIVE : 

As stated in the DOH Manual of Operations for Drug Testing Laboratories in the- Philippines, the general objectives include the following 

1. StandardiZe the procedure of drug testing services in the Philippines among all stakeholders;

Through this DOH- PTC requirement, the BHFS will be able to screen, review and eVaIuate new applications for the subject facility with the end goal of permitting only those that will sufficiently comply with the established standards and guidelines together with the other statutory requirements. 

As part of its technical assistance, the BHFS shall prescribe prototype plan/s for a freestanding SDTL facility with technical guidelines and specifications for the general information, guidance and compliance of prospective applicants. 

Through the above objectives, the BHFS aims to assure the physical acceptability, functional planning and standard design of all approved new applicants of free—standing SDTLincludingthe quality service that they shall eventually render to their clientele.
