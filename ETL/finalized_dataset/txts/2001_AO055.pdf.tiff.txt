<subject>SUBJECT: Formulation of a Standard Operating Procedure in releasing Muslim cadavers from all DOH Hospitals</subject>


<body>

The Department of Health recognizes the different relions and cultures in the country. Filipinos have varied and unique traits which must always be given due respect. Such is the traditional way of burying of a departed Muslim brother. Wherein, the interment must be done within 48 hours after the expiration.

The DOH in its commitment to continously provide systems which are adaptable to all its multicultural clientele, hereby grant the formulation of a Standard Operating Procedure that will address the concern of our Muslim brothers.

All government hospitals are mandated to facilitate the release of cadavers belonging to the Muslim group within or not exceeding 24 hours. All existing policies pertaining to the release of cadavers must be revised and/or modified in accordance thereof.

This Order shall take effect immediately upon approval.

Existing issuance/s related to the subject and all other orders inconsistent with this Administrative Order are hereby rescinded.
