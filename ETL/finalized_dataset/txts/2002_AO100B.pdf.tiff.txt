<subject>SUBJECT: Operational Guidelines for the Implementation of the Rural Health Team Placement Program (RHTPP)</subject>

<body>
I. RATIONALE

The Rural Health Team Placement Program (RHTPP) stemmed from the Rural Health Practice Program (RHPP), which was an undertaking of the Department of Health. It aimed at augmenting the medical human resource in the rural areas. The RHPP has been in operation since 1974 by virtue of letters of Instruction (LOI) 377 and 948. It started as a pro-requisite to the issuance of medical and nursing license. In 1986, it was changed to a voluntary program focused on community health and development, particularly in areas where there were no medical human resource. The RHPP was modified in 1997 to provide other health professionals the Opportunity to serve rural communities.

The Rural Health Team Placement Program's (RHTPP) vision is "Allied health professionals enable communities to take charge of their health needs and help raise the capability of Local Government units (LGU) to deliver health services". Its mission is "To deploy competent allied health professionals in LGUs for service, technology transfer, and capability-building".

The Program recruits allied health professionals to complement the existing workforce of the Rural Health Unit (RHU), District Health Office (DHO) and Provincial Health Office (PHO) and allows them to work as a team. The Rural Health Team includes dentist, nurse, pharmacist, medical technologist, physical and occupational therapist, nutritionist-dietitian, midwife and sanitary inspector.

The need for specific types of health worker is brought about by the long-time prevalence of Specific health problems or diseases like malaria and other mosquito-borne diseases, tuberculosis, malnutrition, diarrheas, parasitism, orodental diseases, etc. Appropriate allied health professionals are made part of the local health team in these rural areas so as to better serve and facilitate interventions to specific health problems of particular communities.

In 1996, the Program had 25 slots allocated equally to five (5) regions. Throughout the years, funding support gradually increased so that by year 2001, there had been a 280% increase in government budgetary allocation to prime-up the Program response to the Sentrong Sigla initiative of the LGU.
