<subject>SUBJECT: NAMING OF FRUIT BEVERAGES</subject>

<body>
To avoid confusing and misleading presentation of fruit beverages, the following definitions shall serve as the guidelines for naming of fruit beverages.

1. Fruit Juice - consists of fermentable but unfermented juice obtained:

a. from the fruit by a mechanical process which shall cause the removal of seeds and excess pulp, the finished product having the characteristic color, aroma and flavor typical of the juice of the fruit from which it was obtained; or

b. from concentrated fruit juice by the replacement of water in the amount necessary to obtain the organoleptic (sensory) and analytical characteristic of juice obtained by the same mechanical process mentioned above.

It may contain added sugar, provided that, when more than 4% (w/w) sugar has been added the word "sweetened" or "with added sugar" shall appear conspicuously on the main panel of the label.

2. Concentrated Fruit Juice - contains only juice as defined above from which water has been removed by physical means, reducing the volume of the juice by about 50%.

3. Fruit Juice Drink - is a ready to drink fruit beverage prepared by mixing water with fruit juice concentrate and into which sugar and citric acid may be added to adjust the soluble solid content and acidity of the finished product. The main ingredient which is the fruit juice concentrate is composed of fruit juice, essential oils, essences or extracts with or without added sugar.

This product may also be referred to as Juice from Concentrate.

4. Fruit Drink Concentrate - is a blend of fruit beverage and syrup. The fruit beverage base is a mixture of fruit flavors, essences and coloring material. Citric acid and preservatives may be present in the base or may be added during the preparation of the concentrate. Each part of the concentrate shall be diluted with not less than one part of water to produce a ready to drink beverage.

5. Fruit Nectar - is the fermentable but unfermented product obtained by the addition of water and sugar to fruit juice, concentrated fruit juice, fruit juice or a mixture of those products.

6. Fruit Drink Mix - is a mixture of dry or almost dry ingredients (fruit flavors, sugar, citric acid, mineral salts, etc) that are readily soluble in water. It may contain dehydrated fruit juice.

Fruit beverages whose label claims do not conform with the above definitions shall be considered misbranded under Section 15 (g) of R.A. 3720.

This regulation is being issued in the interest of consumer protection and shall take effect immediately upon approval.
