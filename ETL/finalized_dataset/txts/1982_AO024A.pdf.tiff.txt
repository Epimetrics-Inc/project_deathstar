<subject>

Subject: Banning Neomycin in Anti—diarrheal Preparations. </subject>
<body> For many years, it has been known that Neomycin can cause serious adverse effects including renal damage, ototoxicity and neuromuscular blockade. Ototoxic1ty involving the cochlear portion of the eighth cranial nerve is usually irreversible even after the drug is discontinued. Enough absorption can occur to produce deafness particularly in patients with renal impairment. Deafness may occur even with conventional doses. Loss of hearing usually develops during the course of treatment. However, it may not become apparent to the patient until sometime after the therapy has been stopped, because of the time required for the defect to progress into the range of sound used in conversation. Risk of both ototoxicity and nephrotoxicity is greater in persons with decreased renal function.
	Most causes of diarrhea are found to be resistant to Neomycin. Its constant use promotes pseudomembranous colitis in infants and children

ORDERS

1. Anti-diarrheal preparations containing Neomycin in dosage form for oral administration are no longer registrable
2. Henceforth, the registration of the above-mentioned preparations are hereby recalled and cancelled.
3. For the orderly phasing-out of stocks which have been distributed to retail outlet prior to the issuance of this Order all stocks should have been cancelled and withdrawn by the manufacturer or distributor before June 30, 1982.

	This Order supersedes all orders, rules and regulations or parts thereof inconsistent herewith and shall take effect on July 1, 1982.
