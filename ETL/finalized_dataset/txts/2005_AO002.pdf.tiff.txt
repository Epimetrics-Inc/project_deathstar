<subject>SUBJECT : RULES AND REGULATIONS FOR THE ESTABLISHMENT OF THE PHILIPPINE NATIONAL BLOOD SERVICES AMENDING PERTINENT PROVISIONS OF ADMIN. ORDER NO. 9, S. 1995 (RULES AND REGULATIONS IMPLEMENTING R. A. 7719 OTHERWISE KNOWN AS THE NATIONAL BLOOD SERVICES ACT OF 1994)</subject>

<body>
SECTION I. RATIONALE

Republic Act 7719 otherwise known as the "National Blood Services Act of 1994" provides that the following are policies of the state:

"a) To promote and encourage voluntary blood donation by the citizenry.
b) To provide for adequate, safe, affordable and equitable distribution of blood and blood products;
c) To mandate the Department of Health to establish and organize a National Blood Transfusion Network in order to rationalize and improve the promotion of adequate and safe supply of blood;"

Pursuant to Section 5. National Voluntary Services Program (NVBSP), of RA 7719, the Department of Health, in cooperation. with the PNRC and PBCC and other agencies and organizations have planned and implemented a NVBSP to meet in an evolutionary manner, the needs for blood transfusion in all regions of the country. One of the goals of the NVBSP Strategic Plan for 2004-2008 is: "2. Strengthening of a nationally coordinated network of Blood Service Facilities to increase efficiency by Centralized Testing and Blood Component Processing as well as improved blood collection and distribution systems."

The Centralization of collection, testing and processing of blood and its components is a global strategy advocated by the WHO in the provision of an adequate supply of safe blood. The high volume of activities, especially in testing and processing of blood promotes efficiency and competency, thus ensuring the quality of the blood products. Furthermore, the high volume blood banking procedures make automation cost-effective and can take advantage of discounts in the bulk purchasing of reagents, glassware and supplies.

These Rules and Regulations are promulgated for the establishment of the Philippine National Blood Services (PNBS) pursuant to Section 5. National Voluntary Services Program and Section 6. Upgrading of Services and Facilities, of RA 7719 and amending pertinent provisions of Administrative Order No. 9, s. 1995 entitled the "Rules and Regulations Implementing Republic Act No. 7719 otherwise known as the National Blood Services Act of 1994" specifically the following sections:
