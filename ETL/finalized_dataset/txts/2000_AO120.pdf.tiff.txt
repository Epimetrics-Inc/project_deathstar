<subject>SUBJECT: Integration of Public Health and Hospital Services in support of the National Objectives for Health and the Creation of the Public Health Unit in all DOH Hospitals, Medical Centers and Specialty Centers</subject>

<body>

I. BACKGROUND:

The principles of integration of clinical care programs under a broad public health framework are not new to the Department of Health. This has been a consistent polity direction for the past twenty years.

For the past two decades, the highest burden of disease has been caused by a group of conditions that can be prevented by public health interventions. Both for infectious and degenerative diseases prevention and control, there is little to argue against the cost—effectiveness and cost-beneﬁt of strong preventive and promotive health service systems. Unfortunately, in the past, hospitals have tended to focus on a curative care paradigm while public health programs have been relegated to implementation at primary health facility levels resulting in poor disease control and prevention outcomes. This situation has been recognized in the past, necessitating a conscious integration process through a series of policy statements and program development initiatives for integration.

As early as 1982, under Executive Order 851, the Ministry of Health reorganization initiated the integration of regional laboratories and regional mental hospitals with the regional hospitals and the merging of the Provincial Health Office
with the Provincial Hospital to form the Integrated Provincial Health Office (IPHO). Again, in 1987, under Executive Order 119, the integration process was further strengthened by the retention of the Integrated PHO, and the creation of the District Health Office (DHO) to absorb both public health and district hospital functions.

In 1991, under Republic Act 7160, otherwise known as the Local Government Code of 580 public hospitals to local government units created new challenges for the integration process as the IPHO and the DHO  became  part of the administrative responsibility of the provinces, while rural health units and barangay health facilities became part of the administrative responsibility of the municipalities. Due to transition problems in the early phase of devolution, the process of integration was overshadowed by issues related to unequal distribution of the internal revenue allotment, inadequate financial support for the poorer local government units, and the security of tenure and benefits of health workers.

In 1993, the Department of Health issued Department Order 391 reviving the integration strategy through the Hospitals as Centers of Wellness Program. This program specifically aimed to integrate preventive, promotive and primary health care programs into conventional services among tertiary and specialized hospitals.

In 1999, under Executive Order 102, “Redirecting the functions and operations of the Department of Health”, the principles of integration are revisited by defining the role of the Department of Health as a “direct service provider for specific programs that affect large segments of the population such as, tuberculosis, malaria, schistosomiasis, HIV-AIDS, and other emerging infections and micronutrient deficiencies.” Furthermore, the Rationalization and Streamlining Plan that executes E.O. 102 provides for a structural integration of public health programs with the hospital programs under the Health Operations Cluster of the DOH.

Furthermore, under the Health Sector Reform Agenda, “integration of appropriate and priority public health programs into hospital services”, is identified as one of five reform strategies for the hospital sector.

In support of this major policy direction, this Administrative Order hereby requires the creation of a Public Health Unit in all DOH Hospitals, Medical Centers and Specialty Centers as the focal point for integration.
