<body>

I. INTRODUCTION

Iodine deficiency disorders (IDD) comprise a group of preventable nutritional deficiencies of public health importance. Recent surveys conducted by the Food and Nutrition Research Institute revealed that the national goiter prevalence has doubled from 3.5% in 1987 to 6.7% in 1993 among subjects 7 years of age and older. Significant IDD has been identified in 60% of the country’s provinces and over one-fourth of pregnant and lactating women were found to be deficient.

Cognizant of this IDD prevalence and its detrimental clients in the physical, mental and social status of Filipinos, the Department of Health has initially undertaken iodized oil capsule (IOC) supplementation to address the problem. However, due to its cost and short-term utility, other interventions are being pursued. The government is presently implementing the iodization of raw salt as an alternative to IOC supplementation. It is also currently intensifying the promotion of iodized salt consumption and the monitoring of salt producers/importers/traders, salt retailers, food manufacturers and food establishments.

These aforementioned activities have underscored the role of Local Government Units (LGUs) as partners in ensuring the success of the National Salt Iodization Program (NSIP). Corollary to these, the Kristal Award was conceptualized. The Award aims to solicit participation of and give due credit to LGUs actively involved in salt iodization initiatives. Present government goals aim to achieve at least 50% universal salt iodization (USI) in the country by the end of 1999 and 100% by the end of 2000. The combined efforts of national and local government entities toward a common objective is envisioned to provide the needed thrust in eliminating IDD nationwide.


II. IMPLEMENTING GUIDELINES


1. Period and Area Coverage

1.1 For 1999, the Kristal Awards will have a national launching which shall be held in November as one of the culminating activities of the Garantisadong Pambata Preschoolers Health Week Part II. The National Publicity and Promotions Subcommittee of the Kristal Awards is tasked in ensuring the conduct of this launching.

1.2 From your 2000 onwards, annual evaluations of LGUs nominated for the Kristal Award shall be held Contest period shall be from May to November of each year. Regional and national awarding ceremonies shall be conducted during the Garantisadong Pambata:
Preschoolers Health Week Part II.


2. Levels of Competition 

2.1 Regional-Level Competitions

From year 2000 onwards, regional-level competitions shall be held which shall be supervised by the concerned Regional Health Office through the creation, of a Regional Steering Committee and its three (3) Regional Working Subcommittees for the Kristal Award (namely, a Technical and Evaluation Subcommittee, Logistics Subcommittee, and a Publicity and Promotions Subcommittee), and in consultation with the National Steering Committee and its three (3) National Working Subcommittees.

2.2 National-Level Competition

All regional winners of the Kristal Awards shall compete for the national awards. The National Task Force on Salt Iodization shall create a National Steering Committee and National Working Subcommittees for the Kristal Awards to oversee the implementation of national competitions from year 2000 onwards.


3. Category, Subcategories and Nominations

The competition is open to all LGUs under the following subcategories - province, city, municipality and barangay.

3.1 For regional-level competitions, all Regional Health Offices shall submit nominations which shall be a maximum of 1 province (except for NCR), 3 cities, 3 municipalities and 6 barangays per region. A barangay may be nominated even if its parent municipality or city is not nominated. Also, a nominated municipality or city may not necessarily come from a nominated province.

3.2 Winners from the different regions for the barangay, municipal, city and provincial subcategories shall vie for the national awards.

LGUs shall be eligible for nomination for the Kristal Awards if they have initiated the following:

a. Filing of a local resolution or ordinance supporting the ASIN Law.
b. LGU participation in provincial- or regional-level training workshop on monitoring the implementation of the ASIN Law.
c. Conduct of at least two community-based household monitoring utilizing the Lot Quality Assurance Sampling (LQAS) technique from 1997 onwards.


4. Reward System

For each subcategory (barangay, municipality, city or province) under the LGU category, 1 winner and 2 runners-up will be selected. This applies to both regional and national levels. All winners and runners-up will receive trophies during awarding ceremonies while finalists will receive plaques of recognition. 

Additionally, the names of both winners and non—winning nominees at regional competitions shall be published at widely-circulated regional or provincial newspapers while those at the national competitions shall be published in major national dailies. Other forms of media such as local/national radio or television shall be utilized to announce winners. 

The National Steering Committee shall likewise find additional means to reward  national winners inclusive of the provision of salt iodization supplies (fortificants, sealers, test kits, etc.) whenever available.
 

5. Criteria for Selection of Winners

A set of criteria with corresponding statistical weighted score (point system) has been established in order to aid evaluators in choosing winners. These criteria shall apply to both regional and national competitions.

<image>table_1.png</image>

5.1 Each nominated LGU shall have passed or at the very least filed a resolution or ordinance supporting the ASlN Law. Specifically, the ordinance shall be known as Intensification of the Use of Iodized Salt in the province / city / municipality of (Name). It shall express a policy of active participation in the program of eliminating iodine deficiency disorders and shall cover salt producers/importers/traders, salt retailers, food manufacturers and food establishments. It shall stipulate the development and implementation of promotional activities on the use of iodized salt, the conduct of periodic monitoring of the quality of iodized salt produced, distributed or consumed within the area as well as the imposition of sanctions upon violators of the ASIN Law.

Such resolution or ordinance shall be supported by the existence of a long-term plan enunciating not only the implementation but also the sustainability of promotional and monitoring activities.

5.2 The LGU shall have put in-place a system for monitoring which shall be in accordance with disseminated BFAD guidelines and shall be applicable to salt producers importers/traders (especially medium and big-scale businesses), salt retailers (groceries, supermarkets, wet markets, sari-sari stores, etc.) as well as food manufacturers (makers of food with salt as ingredient must use iodized salt unless the sensory quality [taste, color, etc ] of the finished product is affected) and food establishments (hotels, restaurants, canteens, etc.). The system shall actively involve local health offices and personnel (local nutritionist-dietitians, food and drug regulation officers, sanitary inspectors, etc.) It shall be used to determine the level of compliance with the ASIN Law as well as give warnings to or impose sanctions upon violators of the law. Subcriteria include the regularity of monitoring activities (at least twice a year) as well as logistical support provided by the LGU for monitoring purposes (transportation, reproduction of monitoring forms, etc.). 

5.3 Nominated LGUs shall have formulated and implemented intensive promotional and advocacy activities related to the ASIN Law. Said activities may imply that LGU support (funds, etc.) may have been provided to conduct such events. Innovativeness in promoting the use of iodized salt shall be recognized such as the use of local social gatherings or religious services to convey health messages, or the production of local promotional materials such as radio/TV/cinema plugs, posters, flyers, stickers, streamers, billboards, etc. An increase in the number of promotional activities compared to the previous year as well as the extent of coverage of information dissemination (materials must reach far-flung areas/establishments) shall also be considered.

5.4 The LGU shall have a high proportion (percentage) of compliance with the ASIN Law among its salt and food businesses, i.e., salt producers/importers/traders (especially medium and big scale), salt retailers, food establishments and food manufacturers in the area. This indicator necessitates the establishment and maintenance of an updated registry of the actual number of these salt and food businesses, whether complying with the ASIN Law or not. This proportion shall be initially computed by local health personnel (e.g., sanitary inspectors, heads of unit, etc.) subject to validation by the evaluation subcommittee. The type of disciplinary actions taken (referral, warnings or sanctions) relative to non-compliance shall be noted. 

The proportions computed by local health personnel participating in regional-level competitions shall be submitted to the Regional Technical and Evaluation Subcommittee (TES) which will forward the data to the National TES for classification, i.e., the computed proportions of LGUs shall be categorized into 3 classes (low, medium and high proportion),
the class interval of which shall be determined statistically by the National TES. (Regional TES must submit computed LGU proportions to the National TES c/o Nutrition Service). Once classified, the National TES will convey the classification data back to the Regional TES for consolidation of LGU scores. It is the National TES, rather than the Regional TES, which is tasked in classifying LGU proportions into low, medium or high (both at regional- and national-level contests).

For example, computed proportions of salt producers/importers/traders that fall within the class interval 21-30 % may be classified by the National TES as ‘medium’ for a given year. Such interval will vary yearly based on annual field data submitted to the central office.

5.5 Each nominated LGU shall likewise have a high household utilization rate for iodized salt. This shall utilize the Lot Quality Assurance Sampling (LQAS) technique which determines whether a barangay has passed (high) or failed to achieve (low) a certain critical LQAS value that measures utilization rate. The technique involves collaborative efforts among sources of salt samples (household head for urban areas, schoolchildren for rural areas), sample collectors (Barangay Health Workers for urban, schoolteachers for rural), and sample testers (BHWs for urban, both BHWs and schoolteachers for rural). 

Subcriteria include the regularity in conducting LQAS (which ideally must be twice yearly), the sample size used in LQAS which must be in accordance with that articulated in the Community-Based Salt Monitoring Manual (the bigger the number of households sampled, the less the sampling error), and the proportion of barangays in that LGU which  pass LQAS standards (computed as the number of barangays passing LQAS divided by the total number of barangays in that LGU which conducted LQAS x 100. For instance, the
proportion may be deemed high if it is 50% passing or more for a given year, low if it is 49% or less). The Regional TES is tasked in classifying LQAS proportions as high or low.


6. Contest Mechanics 

6.1 At regional-level competitions, each Regional Health Office shall submit nominees for the different subcategories (barangay, municipality, city or province) according to the maximum number of nominees allowed for each subcategory. Nominations shall be
submitted to the National Technical and Evaluation Subcommittee (TES) c/o the Nutrition Service of the Department of Health.

At national level competitions, the regional winners per subcategory shall be submitted by the Regional Health Office to the National TES for inclusion in official list of national-level nominees.

6.2 Nominees for regional-level competitions shall be reviewed by the national TES for initial validation versus available data files at the Central Office (LQAS accomplishments, existence of local resolutions/ordinances, proportion of medium and big salt producers or food establishments complying with the ASIN Law, etc).

6.3 Field validations and evaluations shall be conducted by the TES. At regional-level contests, the regional TES shall evaluate barangay, municipal, city and provincial nominees. During the national contest, regional winners for the different subcategories will, in turn, be assessed by zonal teams deployed by the national TES. A total of four zonal teams (each zone is made up of several regions) composed of staff from BFAD and the Nutrition Service of the Department of Health will evaluate nominees nationwide. Prescribed individual (i.e., per nominee — Form 1) and consolidated (i.e., all nominees - Form 2) evaluation forms shall be disseminated for use of both regional and national TES evaluators.

6.4 Evaluation results shall be processed by the regional TES for regional-level contests and by the national TES for the national contest. The TES shall be guided by the aforementioned criteria for the selection of winners.

For regional level contests, the regional TES shall ensure that computed proportions (percentage of salt and food businesses complying with the ASIN Law in that LGU) will be forwarded to the national TES early enough for classification into low, medium or high. The classification will be relayed back to RHOs for scoring purposes. Furthermore, the regional TES shall submit to the national TES copies of the consolidated regional evaluation results (Form 2) enumerating all nominees per subcategory and the corresponding scores per evaluator for information purposes.

6.5 Winners, runners—up and finalists shall be notified of the results at least 2 weeks before the awarding.

6.6 Awarding shall be held in November of each year during the Garantisadong Pambata: Preschoolers Health Week Part II. Regional Health Offices shall conduct regional awarding ceremonies to recognize winners, runners-up and finalists for the different subcategories at the regional level. The National Publicity and Promotions Subcommittee of the Kristal Awards shall conduct a national awarding ceremony for national winners.
