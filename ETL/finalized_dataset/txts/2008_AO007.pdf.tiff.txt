<subject>SUBJECT: Schedule of Fees for the Licensure of General Clinical
Laboratories and the Reqistration of Special Clinical Laboratories </subject>

<body>
I. RATIONALE

By virtue of Administrative Order No. 2007—0027 Revised Rules and
Regulations Governing the Licensure and Regulation of Clinical Laboratories in the Philippines, the classification of clinical laboratories was revised.  aboratories are now classified according to service capability as general clinical laboratories or special clinical laboratories. The former is further classified into the following: primary category, secondary category, tertiary category, and limited service capability (for institution-based only).

Another important provision of A0. No. 2007-0027 is the decentralization of the licensing process for clinical laboratories to the Centers for Health Development (CHDs), both for initial licensure and the renewal of license. Since licensing is now performed by the CHDs, there would be an expected decrease in the cost of regulation, which should be reflected in a decrease in the License to Operate (LTO) fees, particularly for non-hospital-based clinical laboratories.

In view of the above, the schedule of fees related to the regulation of clinical laboratories has to be revised in order to address the LTO fee or registration fee for the two new categories of clinical laboratories, namely the special clinical laboratory as well as the general clinical laboratory with limited service capability, taking into account the changes in the licensing process for clinical laboratories.

II. OBJECTIVE:

This Administrative Order prescribes the schedule of fees for certain services
rendered by the CHDs in relation to the regulation of clinical laboratories, particularly the LTO fees for general clinical laboratories and the registration fee for special clinical laboratories.

III. FEES, SURCHARGES AND DISCOUNTS

A. Schedule of Fees

The CHDs shall prescribe the following fees for their services related to the regulation of clinical laboratories.

1. Hospital —- Based General Clinical Laboratory

The LTO fee for a hospital-based general clinical laboratory with limited service capability shall be the same as the current LTO fee for the general clinical laboratory of primary category. It shall be incorporated into the hospital LTO fee.

The LTO fee for hospital—based general clinical laboratory of primary, secondary and tertiary categories shall follow the current schedule of fees prescribed under Administrative Order No. 2007—0023 Schedule of Fees for the One—Stop Shop Licensure System for Hospitals.

2. Non -— Hospital —— Based General Clinical Laboratory

The following is the new schedule of fees for non-hospital-based general clinical laboratories. Because of the decentralization of the licensing process for clinical laboratories to the CHDs, the LTO fees for these health facilities are set lower than those prescribed under A.O. 2007-0001.

The LTO fee for a non-hospitaI-based general clinical laboratory with limited service capability shall be the same as the prescribed LTO fee for the general clinical laboratory of primary category.
