<subject>SUBJECT: “Revision of Fees and Charges imposed by the Bureau of Quarantine in accordance with RA 9271, repealing such orders inconsistent therewith, and for other such purposes.”</subject>


<body> 

I. RATIONALE

As part of the overall effort to review other fees and charges which was last updated in 2000, the Bureau conducted a detailed study of all chargeable services rendered to its clientele in order to conform to the current cost and expenditure. Results of the study revealed that the present fees collected fall below incurred operation cost. This only means that government is continuously subsidizing the cost of regulation. Such subsidy should well be invested in more problematic concerns in the health sector. The regulated industries in the health sector should share in the cost of administering regulation. An initial step towards this policy direction is the issuance of A0. no. 19 s. 2005 dated July 19, 2005, which revised the schedule of fees for yellow fever vaccination administered by the Bureau of Quarantine, formerly known as the National Quarantine Ofﬁce. Thus, the proposed necessary allowable adjustments in this Order are considered.

This increase in regulatory fees is also in line with Executive Order no. 197 dated January 15, 2000 of the Ofﬁce of the President, entitled: “Directing all Departments, Bureaus, Agencies and Instrumentalities including all Government Corporations to increase their rates of fees and charges by at least 20%.” In other words, persons receiving services for which charges are imposed are made to share the burden of expenses incurred by the government.

All quarantine fees and charges shall be primarily used to maintain a stock of necessary medicines, vaccines and supplies, in compliance to Section 9, Republic Act no. 9271, otherwise known as the Quarantine Act of 2004. Inaddition, these revenues shall also be used to defray operating cost, improve infrastructures and quality of services

II. OBJECTIVE

III. SCOPE AND COVERAGE

The increase in the schedule of fees and charges shall apply to all travelers, seamen, overseas Filipino workers including government or police/military personnel, shipping and airline companies and all those who require such services of the Bureau of Quarantine, as mandated by RA 9271 and it s implementing rules and regulations.
