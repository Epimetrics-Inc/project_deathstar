<subject>Subject: PHASING OUT OF POTASSIUM BROMATE AS A FLOUR TREATMENT AGENT FOR BREAD-MAKING</subject>
<body>
	This Order is issued pursuant to Section 26 (a) of RA 3720 as amended in relation to Article 21(a) and (b) of RA 7394.
	The 38th report of the Joint FAO/WHO (JECFA) 1992 states that:
		“Recent oral long-term toxicity/carcinogenicity studies of potassium bromate revealed renal-cell tumors, peritoneal mesotheliomas and thyroid follicular-cell tumors in rats and a slightly increased incidence of renal-cell tumors in hamsters. In view of these findings and the results obtained in in vivo as well as in vitro mutagenicity studies, it was concluded that the potassium bromate is a genotoxic carcinogen.”

	Wherefore, upon recommendation of the BFAD director after consultation with the affected sectors. * this order is hereby issued to phase out Potassium Bromate as a flour-treatment agent for bread-making.

	The tentative date for such phase-out is set on March 31, 1995.
	The BFAD in an appropriate administrative issuance shall provide for the guidelines for an orderly phase out and shall determine the final date when Potassium Bromate shall no longer be allowed in bread-making.
	After the said final date, use of Potassium Bromate or Potassium Bromate containing ingredient in bread-making shall make the bread or bakery product adulterated in accordance with the Section 14 of RA 3720 as amended. More possession of Potassium Bromate or ingredients containing Potassium Bromate by bakeries and bakery-ingredient supplies will give rise to the presumption that the same will be used in bread-making.
	This Order shall be effective after publication in two (2) newspapers of general circulation at least once a week for a period of not less than one (1) month.
