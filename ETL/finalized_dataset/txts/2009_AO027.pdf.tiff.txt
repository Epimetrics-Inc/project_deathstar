<subject>SUBJECT: Amendment to AO 2007- 0029 regarding the Revised Guidelines on Management of Animal Bite Patients </subject>

<body>
I. BACKGROUND/RATIONALE 

Rabies, present in all continents and endemic in most African and Asian countries, is a . ,. fatal zoonotic viral disease, transmitted to humans through contact with infected animals, both ., domestic and wild. Rabies is estimated to 'cause at least 55,000 deaths per year worldwide, about ‘ 56% of which occur in Asia and 43.6% in Africa, particularly in rural areas on both continents. In the Philippines, although rabies is not among the leading causes of morbidity and mortality, rabies is considered a signiﬁcant public health problem for two reasons: 1) it is one of the most acutely fatal infections and 2) it is responsible for the death of 200-300 Filipinos annually. 

The Department of Health continues to be committed to the ﬁght against rabies and has set the goal of rabies elimination in 2020. An essential part of this strategy is the provision of post-exposure prophylaxis to bite victims and pre-exposure prophylaxis to high risk individuals as mandated by the Anti-Rabies Act of 2007. Pursuant thereto, guidelines for the appropriate as well as cost-effective management of animal bite patients have been issued. 

Historically the management of animal bite cases had to be updated every ﬁve (5) years and the guidelines revised accordingly to incorporate new and better treatment modalities based on research results. The ﬁrst revision was made in 1997, the second in 2002 and the 3rd in 2007. 

Since the release of the latest guidelines in 2007, new recommendations related to rabies management have been released by the World Health Organization and the US Centers for Disease Control. The Anti-Rabies Act of 2007 and its Implementing Rules and Regulations provided for the provision of pre—exposure prophylaxis among school children from high risk areas. These current guidelines are therefore amended to incorporate these crucial recommendations. 

II. OBJECTIVE

To provide updated guidelines and procedures to ensure effective and efﬁcient management of rabies exposures toward eventual reduction, if not elimination, of human rabies 

III. AMENDMENTS IN A0 2007-0029

The following sections of A0 2007-0029 are hereby amended as follows: 

1) Section III. COVERAGE (in page 2) 

All government health workers at all levels shall adopt these treatment guidelines to ensure standardized and rational management of animal bite patients. Private practitioners in the country are strongly encouraged to adopt these treatment guidelines. 

2) Section IV. DEFINITION OF TERMS (in page 2) 

A. Post Exposure Prophylaxis (PEP) - formerly post exposure treatment (PET); refers to anti-rabies treatment administered after an exposure (such as bite, scratch, lick, etc.) to potentially rabid animals. It includes local wound care, administration of rabies vaccine with or without Rabies Immune Globulin (RIG) depending on category of exposure. 

B. Pre exposure prophylaxis — refers to rabies vaccination administered before an exposure to potentially rabid animals. This is usually given to those who are at high risk of getting rabies such as veterinarians, animal handlers, staff in the rabies laboratory, hospitals handling rabies patients and school children from high risk areas, etc. 

3) Section VI.A.3. Rabies exposure is stratified in three categories with corresponding management guidelines as shown in Table 1. (in page 4) 

Table 1. Categories of Rabies Exposure with Corresponding Management

4) Section VI.B.l.l.2: Types of Rabies Vaccines and Dosage (in page 5)  

The National Rabies Prevention and Control Program (NRPCP) provides the following anti-rabies tissue culture vaccines (TCV) a) Puriﬁed Vero Cell Rabies Vaccine (PVRV) —- 0.5 ml/vial and b) Puriﬁed Chick Embryo Cell Vaccine (PCECV)- 1.0 ml/vial.

Recommendations on the intradermal administration of anti—rabies vaccines: 

The NRPCP introduced the intradermal (ID) use of rabies tissue culture vaccines in the country in 1997. The Philippines was among the ﬁrst countries to adopt this regimen as recommended by the World Health Organization, in order to totally discontinue the use of nerve tissue vaccine (NTV) which was associated with vaccine induced encephalopathy. To mitigate the expected increase in the cost of PEP with the shift from NTV to TCV, the ID use of these vaccines was introduced. According to WHO, the ID use of tissue culture vaccines can decrease the cost of PEP by as much as 60- 80%. 

However, only a limited number of commercially available rabies vaccines have been proven, to date, as safe and efﬁcacious for PEP when administered by the ID route. Recently, local manufacturers in rabies-endemic countries have started to produce rabies vaccines. The ID use of these vaccines should be based on adherence to WHO requirements for that route and approval by national health authorities as follows, “New vaccine manufacturers should provide clinical evidence that their products are immunogenic and safe when used intradermally. Clinical evidence should include clinical trials involving a vaccine of known immunogenicity and efficacy when used by this route as control, serological testing with rapid ﬂuorescent focus inhibition test, and publication in internationally peer-reviewed journals”. 

To ensure compliance to these recommendations and guarantee that animal bite patients seeking treatment in government Animal Bite Treatment Centers receive only TCV that have been proven to be safe and effective, the program shall utilize for its intradermal regimen only tissue culture vaccines that satisfy the following criteria : 

1. The vaccine is registered with and approved by the Food and Drug Administration, formerly known as Bureau of Food and Drugs (BFAD); 

2. The vaccine has been proven to be safe and efﬁcacious for PEP when administered by the ID route using the schedule recommended by the World Health Organization. Having limited knowledge on and experience with the ID use of all available anti-rabies vaccines in the country, the program shall utilize the WHO list of approved TCV for ID use OR in the case of vaccines not included in the WHO list for ID use, the vaccine must comply with WHO requirements for new rabies vaccines and must have gone through local clinical trials on safety and immunogenicity which are published in peer-reviewed journals; 

3. The potency of vaccines for ID use should be at least 0.5 IU/ID dose as evidenced by their lot release certiﬁcate. The potency of the vaccine batch should be provided by the manufacturer; AND 

4. The product insert must contain the vaccine’s approved ID dose and consistent with its Certiﬁcate of Registry (CPR) for Disease Control. 

5) Section VI.B.2.a. Types of Rabies Immune Globulins (in page 6)

6) Section VI.B.2.d. Administration (in page 7) 

1. The total computed dose of RIG should be inﬁltrated around and into the wound as much as anatomically feasible, even if the lesion has healed. In case some amount of the total computed dose of RIG is left after all wounds have been inﬁltrated, it should be administered deep [M at a site distant from the site of vaccine injection (preferably anterolateral thigh) using another needle. The total computed dose should be administered as a single dose. 

2. A gauge 23 or 24 needle, 1 inch length should be used for inﬁltration. Multiple needle injections into the same wound should be avoided. 

3. A skin test must be performed prior to ERIG administration using a gauge 26 needle. For skin testing, 0.02 ml of 1:10 dilution of solution is inﬁltrated to raise a blob 3 mm and read after 15 minutes. A positive skin test is an induration >6 mm surrounded by a ﬂarelerythema. If initial skin test is positive, repeat skin test on same arm; use distilled water as control on the other arm. The skin test is considered positive if the ERIG skin test is positive but the control is negative. 

4. If a ﬁnger or toe needs to be inﬁltrated, care must be taken not to impair blood circulation. Injection of an excessive amount may lead to cyanosis, swelling and pain. 

5. RIG should not exceed the computed dose as it may reduce the efﬁcacy of the vaccine. If the computed dose is insufﬁcient to inﬁltrate all bite wounds, it may be diluted with sterile saline 2 or 3 fold for thorough inﬁltration of all wounds. 

6. RIG should be administered at the same time as the ﬁrst dose of vaccine (day 0). In case RIG is unavailable on day 0, it may still be given any time before the day 7 dose of the vaccine. However if the day 3 and/or day 7 doses of the vaccine have not been given, RIG may still be given anytime. 

7. In the event that RIG and vaccine cannot be given on the same day, the vaccine should be given before RIG because the latter inhibits the level of neutralizing antibodies induced by immunization. 

8. RIG is given only once during the same course of PEP. 

9. Patients with Positive skin test to puriﬁed BRIG should be given HRIG. 

10. HRIG is preferred for the following: 
a. History of hypersensitivity to equine sera 
b. Multiple severe exposures (especially where dog is sick or suspected of being rabid) on head and neck area 
c. Symptomatic HIV infected patients 

11. Patient must be observed for at least one hour after injection of ERIG for immediate allergic reactions.

The following provisions shall be added to section VI (page 23): 

N. Injection Safety: A safe injection is deﬁned by the World Health Organization as an injection that: 0 Does not harm the recipient 1» Does not expose the health staff to any avoidable risks 0 Does not result in waste that is dangerous to the community. 

I. Injection Equipment 

1. Auto-Disable (AD) Syringes~ are disposable injection devices that are especially made to prevent re—use and are therefore less likely than standard disposable syringes to cause person-to—person transmission of blood-bome diseases. 

The program recommends that health workers use AD syringe in their respective ABTC. 

2. Conventional Syringes~ are plastic syringes with steel needles that are provided usually by the manufacturer in sterile package. The needle may either be ﬁxed to the syringe when it is produced or attached by the health staff just before use. 

2. Management of Sharp Waste 

Used syringes and needles should never be dumped in open areas where people might pick them up, step on them, or come in contact with them in any way. 

The need to better manage used or contaminated sharps is through the use of safety boxes or sharp containers. These are puncture-resistant containers where used syringes and needles can be immediately and temporarily stored after use until its ﬁnal disposal. 

3. Waste Disposal 

Collector boxes ﬁlled with used syringes and needles should be immediately brought to its ﬁnal disposal. The program recommends the following methods of disposal: 

1. Use of septic vault 
2. Pit burial; and 
3. Waste treatment and ﬁnal disposal to landﬁll 

III. REPEALING CLAUSE 

Provisions of Administrative Order No. 2007-0029 dated September 21, 2007 “Revised Guidelines on Management of Animal Bite Patients” and Administrative Order No. 2005—0022 “Amendment to A0. 1645. 2002 dated August 25, 2005 and any other issuances inconsistent herewith are hereby rescinded. 

IV. EFFECTIVITY 

This order shall take effect immediately.
