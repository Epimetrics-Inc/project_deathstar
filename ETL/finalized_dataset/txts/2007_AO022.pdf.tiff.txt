<subject>SUBJECT: Violations under the One-Stop Shop Licensure System for Hospitals</subject>


<body>

I. Background l Rationale

The FOURmuIa One (F1) for Health identified the harmonization and streamlining of systems and processes as major strategies in making health regulation more rational and client-responsive. In this regard, the One-Stop Shop Licensure System for Hospitals was established by the Department of Health (DOH).

However, hospital-based medical facility for overseas workers and seafarers, hospital-based drug abuse treatment and rehabilitation center, facility using radioactive material that are currently regulated by the Philippine Nuclear Research Institute and performance of kidney transplantation are excluded in the One-Stop Shop Licensure System.

Under this new licensure system, any violation committed by the hospital in relation to existing rules and regulations may result in sanctions such as the suspension or revocation of the license and the closure of the hospital. This Order shall define violations and their corresponding sanctions that are not included in existing rules and regulations.
