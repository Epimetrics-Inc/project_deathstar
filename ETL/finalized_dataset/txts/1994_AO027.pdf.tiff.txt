V. PREVENTION AND CONTROL OF HIV TRANSMISSION IN HOSPITALS

People who come into physical contact with human blood, body fluids or tissues at work are the only ones potentially at risk of acquiring HIV infection through occupational exposure. The risk is generally low and can be minimized if the infection control guidelines are followed.

A. HIV INFECTION AND THE WAY IT SPREADS

l. The term HIV infection is used when HIV, the cause of AIDS, is present in the body. People with HIV infection may not feel ill or look ill and may even be unaware of their infection.

	Infection is usually indicated by a positive HIV antibody test. In a small number of cases, repeated or more sophisticated tests are necessary to detect the presence of HIV.

Extensive studies worldwide have identified only three ways of spreading HIV infection:

1.1 By having sexual intercourse with an infected person.

1.2 Through the transfer of infected human blood, body fluids or tissues.

1.3 From infected mother to infant before, during or after deliveries.
2. Repeated scientific studies have shown that the risk of HIV infection in the health care setting is low. The very few reported cases of workplace infection have been caused by the transfer of infected blood, body fluids or tissues.
2.1 Health care setting includes

- Hospitals

-Laboratories

- OPD’s

- Clinics

- Homes/community

2.2 Risk of HIVE Transmission in Health Care Setting


2.3 Major Route of Transmission

-Blood and/or Body Fluids
-Cervical/Vaginal secretion
-Semen
-Breast milk (rare)


2.4 Transmission of HIV in:


2.4.1 Patient to health care workers

a. Parenteral contact
— Exposure to HIV infected blood
~ Needle-stick injury/cuts

b. Mucous membrane contact
— Splash of infected blood/body fluids to conjunctivae, nose, lips

c. Broken/Non—intact skin contact
 - Splash of infected blood/body fluids into open wounds,
broken skin, abrasions, dermatitis

 

2.4.2 Patient to Patient

a. Transfusion with HIV contaminated blood and blood products

b. Sharing of HIV contaminated needles and sharp equipment (Indirect route).

2.4.3 Health Care Worker to Patient

a. Unlikely; only possibility is when health care workers is HIV infected

B. HOW THE INFECTION DOESN'T SPREAD

	HIV cannot be transmitted by person to person contact of a casual, non-sexual nature. 

	HIV cannot be transmitted by insects, food, water, sneezing, coughing, toilets, urine, swimming pools, sweat, tears, shared eating and drinking and utensils, clothing or telephones-

 
VI. GENERAL INFECTION CONTROL
A. HANDLING OF BLOOD AND EDDY FLUIDS BY HEALTH CARE WORKERS

1. OBSERVE UNIVERSAL PRECAUTIONS: Treat all human body fluids and tissues as potentially infectious. Fluids or materials derived from human blood or tissues are similarly potentially infectious.

2. WASH HANDS THOROUGHLY between patients and after contact with human blood, body fluids or tissues. Wash hands after removing protective clothing or gloves potentially contaminated with HIV. Soap and water or antiseptic handwashes are appropriate. 

3.  WEAR GLOVES when:

3.1 touching blood, body fluids, mucous membranes and non-intact skin

3.2 handling instruments or equipment-contaminated with human blood, body fluids or tissues.

3.3 drawing blood or performing invasive procedures.

3 4 handling uncooperative patients.
3.5 handling linens or trash.
3.6 cleaning spills.
4. Use plastic bags, forceps, towels or gauze as necessary when gloves are not available

5. WEAR GOWNS or APRONS when:

5.1. splashes of blood and body fluids are expected
5.2 performing surgery, invasive procedures, vaginal delivery or wound drainage

5.3 WEAR MASKS AND EYE COVER OR GOGGLES when:
6.1 droplets or splashes of blood and body fluids are expected as in procedures stated in 5.2

7. Cover open wounds or broken skin to prevent direct contact with human blood, body fluids or tissues.

8. Work on a clean surface with clean instruments. Mop up and remove all human blood, body fluids or tissues. Clean instruments in cold water and soak them in disinfectants. Surfaces should be cleaned with disinfectants. No visible contaminant should remain.

9. Use disposable instrument if at all possible. After use, they should be placed inside unbreakable plastic containers labeled “CAUTION”.

10. WASTE DISPOSAL. Dispose liquid wastes (body fluids) down or drain connected to a sewer. Incinerate, burn or autoclave soiled wastes before disposal.
11. Disinfect materials or areas contaminated with blood using ordinary bleach solution (chlorox) or phenolic agents

DON’T manipulate specimen before disposal
DON’T pipette specimen by mouth - Do use rubber bulb or mechanical pipette.


B.PREVENTION OF HIV TRANSMISSION BY NEEDLES STICK OR OTHER SHARP INSTRUMENTS.

1. Use disposable needles and syringes; use only once and destroy.

2. Use only sterile needles and one sterile syringe per injection.
3. Handle used needles and sharp instruments as infected materials.

4. Wear gloves (double gloves or extra-heavy duty) in handling sharp instruments. 
5. Dispose needles and other sharp instruments in puncture resistant containers and place containers near working area. 

6. Re-usable sharp instruments should* be washed, sterilized and disinfected.

DON’T manipulate, recap, break, bend or remove needles from syringes by hand before disposal.

DON’T use chemical disinfection for needles, syringes and sharp instruments

C. HANDLING/DISPOSAL 0F INFECTED WASTES AND MATERIALS

1. Disinfect/Decontaminate materials or areas contaminated with blood.

1.1 Sterilization (complete destruction of all microorganisms, therefore inactivates HIV and HBV).

1.2 Boiling (for 20 minutes — start timing from start of boiling when sterilization is not possible)

1.3 Decontamination can also be done' by using 70% ethanol, 2%glutaraldebyde, (cidex), 2% household bleach (chlorox), 10% formaldehyde and lysol.

2. Spills should be covered with gauze soaked on household bleach (chlorox) and left for 30 minutes before cleaning.

3. Place wet wastes or used dressings to leak proof containers.

4. For solid waste, incinerate, burn or bury 7 feet deep, 30 feet away from water source.

5. For liquid waste, pour down a sink unto a working sewer.

6. Place needles, sharp instruments in puncture—proof containers immediately after use and preferably incinerated.

7. Disinfect materials or HIV infected area with ordinary bleach solution or phenolic detergent.

D. HOUSEKEEPING PRECAUTIONS

l.  The greatest risk is via needle-stick injury from trash which has not been properly packed for disposal. All sharp instruments and equipment, including needles and syringes, must be, disposed of in puncture-resistant containers.

2.Carry waste in containers which are small enough to be easily held away from the body to avoid injuries.

3. Do not use disinfectant fogging following patient discharge or in any patient care area. Thorough cleaning with soap, water, and chlorine compound is the most effective way to remove soils and microorganisms.


E.  LAUNDRY PRECAUTIONS

1. Handle soiled linen as little as possible. Wear GLOVES when handling it“

2. Place wet linens into leak-proof bags. If no leak-proof containers are available, fold the linen with the wet part inside, and surround with dry linen for carrying.

3. Bag linen at the location Where it is used. Do not sort linen in patient areas.

4. Soak soiled linen and clothing in cold water containing household chlorine bleach (chlorox, freshly diluted 1% solution) and then wash in hot or cold water with detergent.

F. LABORATORY PRECAUTIONS

l. Treat all specimens as potentially infectious. 
2. GLOVES should be worn by all personnel engaged in activities that may involve skin contact with potentially infectious materials.

3. Wash hands after removal of gloves and immediately after contact with blood, body fluids and other specimens.

4. Do not pipette specimens by mouth. Use rubber bulb or mechanical pipettes. 

5. Collect, transport and hold all specimens in leak-proof containers. .

6. All laboratory glasswares, disposable materials and wastes or suspected or known to. contain HIV must he decontaminated preferably in the autoclave before washing or discarding. Incineration of solid wastes may be used as an alternative method of disposal.

7. Work surfaces should be decontaminated at the end of each working day or when overtly contaminated.


 

G. POST-MORTEM PROCEDURES

Precautions for handling dead bodies are the same as those for preventing the transmission of HIV in a health care delivery situation. 
1. All persons should be considered to be HIV infected.

2. Precautions are not needed if there is no contact with blood, semen, vaginal secretions or other fluids. For example, moving a body from the hospital room to the mortuary or home does not require special precautions.

3. All persons performing autopsies or assisting in post-mortem procedures (e-g., embalming) which involve contact with blood, semen, vaginal secretions or tissues should take the following precautions:

3.1 Wear gloves for contact with body fluids
3.2 Wear gown, mask and eye protection (goggles or eye glasses) if splashes of these fluids is expected.

3.3 Disinfect contaminated instruments and surfaces after postmortem procedures

4. Patients who died of AIDS shall be buried unembalmed or he cremated within 24 hours.

VI. STERILIZATION AND DISINFECTION
A. STERILIZATION
       All forms of sterilization will inactivate HIV and HBV
<image>table_1.png</image>>
B. DISINFECTION
1. Boiling for 20 minutes (start timing from the beginning of boiling point) is an effective way to disinfect instruments and equipment when sterilization is not possible


2. Chemical disinfection -  Do not use chemical disinfection for needles and syringes. Chemical disinfection for other invasive equipment should only by used as a last resort..

3. Chlorine compounds (bleach). HIV is rapidly killed by liquid chlorine (household bleach), making it ideal for decontaminating large surfaces. The following are guidelines for chlorine use: 
<image>table_2.png</image>

Chlorine compounds are very unstable. Prepare solution daily or store in a covered brown bottle for up to 30 days. The bottle must be tightly capped between use.
C. OTHER DISINFECTANTS active against HIV:

1. 70% ethyl or isopropyl alcohol
2. 2% glutaraldehyde
3. 3% phenol (or lysol)
4. 2.5% povidone iodine
5.4%'formaldehyde
6. 3% to 6% hydrogen peroxide


D. PRACTICES WHICH INCREASE THE RISK or EXPOSURE TO HIV

Accidents involving exposure to human blood, body fluids or tissues containing HIV have been recorded in the following situation:

l. During recapping or disposal of used needles and other sharp instruments. 
2. When infection control procedures are not routinely applied to all blood, body fluids or tissues. This breakdown in safe procedures has been seen in clinical patient care situation and in laboratory environment. -

VIII. ACCIDENTS

Accidents involving exposure to blood, body fluids or tissues need to be documented. The risk of HIV transmission for each accident should be assessed by a trained infection control officer. If transmission is possible, then testing, with informed consent; should be offered to the people who were exposed. The source of the material involved in exposure should also be tested. Once again, informed consent should be obtained if this involves testing a person.

The particular circumstances of the accident [need to be investigated so that work practices can be changed to prevent a recurrence.

If potentially exposed person requests testing, then an HIV-antibody test should be done immediately following the accident and repeated at least three months later. If concerns persist, or arise at a later date, further testing is appropriate. This testing should be STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL .and accompanied by skilled, counseling by a trained counselor. COUNSELLING IS NECESSARY BEFORE AND AFTER THE TEST.
