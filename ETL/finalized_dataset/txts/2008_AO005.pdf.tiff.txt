<subject>SUBJECT; Functional Arrglgement for Managing Field Implementation in support of Health Sector Reform efforts</subject>

<body>
I. BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE
Administrative Order (AO) No. 2005-0023 entitled, “Implementing
Guidelines for Fourmula One (F1) for Health as Framework for Health Reforms” was issued on August 30, 2005 to provide for an effective and functional management infrastructure that will implement and monitor the Health Sector Reform Agenda at both the national and local levels. F1 for Health management at the national level was organized into three major clusters: (1) Governance and Management Support, (2) Policy and Standards Development and Technical Assistance; and the (3) Field Implementation and Coordination. In line with this functional arrangement, Field Implementation and Coordination Teams (FICTs) for Luzon and NCR, and for Visayas and Mindanao were put in place to manage and coordinate the concerns of 16 Centers for Health and Development     (CHDs). Headed by Undersecretaries, these units were intended to address the wide span of control anticipated to result when all the CHD Regional Directors were to report directly to the Secretary of Health.

This Order is issued to further facilitate implementation of reform
strategies through the CHDs in a streamlined process and to foster improved coordination between the central ofﬁce and CHDs, and among adjacent CHDs including hospitals and regional ofﬁces of DOH attached agencies and key partners.

II. SCOPE

This Order applies to all DOH units and its attached agencies - Bureaus, National Centers, Centers for Health Development, including the Regional Hospitals and Medical Centers, Specialty Hospitals and Special Hospitals and the Philippine Health Insurance Corporation, Population Commission and National Nutrition Council, Philippine Traditional And Alternative Health Care and their regional ofﬁces, and the Drug Rehabilitation Centers.

III. GENERAL GUIDELINES

A. All DOH policies and standards shall be coordinated and disseminated under speciﬁed working arrangements between and among DOH bureaus, centers, ofﬁces and other instrumentalities.

B. Strategic leadership over CHDs shall be established to ensure consistency and harmonization of efforts in the implementation of sector reform initiatives in a devolved health system.

C. Leadership in health emergency preparedness shall be developed to address disasters and other emergency situations that necessitate interventions which transcend regional boundaries.

IV. SPECIFIC GUIDELINES

A. To manage and coordinate implementation of DOH policies and standards, a functional management arrangement shall be put into effect through a Field Implementation Management Ofﬁce (FIMO).

B. The annual plans including ﬁnancial and other resource requirements of the CHDs in the performance of their mandate as regional offices shall be consolidated at the FIMO

C. Leadership during health emergencies that necessitate inter-regional coordination shall be the responsibility of the FIMO

V. FUNCTIONAL ARRANGEMENT: FIELD IMPLEMENTATION MANAGEMENT OFFICE AND ITS COORDINATING STRUCTURE

It shall speciﬁcally perform the following functions:
