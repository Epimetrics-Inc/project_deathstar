<subject>SUBJECT: MANAGEMENT OF THE DOH LINGAP PARA SA MAHIHIRAP PROGRAM FUND UNDER R.A. 8745 OTHERWISE KNOWN AS GENERAL APPROPRIATIONS ACT OF 1999</subject>

<body>

I. PURPOSE AND RATIONALE

Poverty continues to be a problem in the country. In 1998, Republic Act 8425, otherwise known as the Social Reform and Poverty Alleviation Act, was enacted to provide a multi-dimensional approach to poverty alleviation that consists of social, economic, ecological and governance reforms.

Under the present administration efforts are geared towards poverty eraadication by reducing the current poverty incidence of 32% to 20% by the year 2004. The Lingap Para sa Mahihirap Program, or simply the Lingap Program, serves as the vehicle in putting together poverty. The Lingap program addresses the Minimum Basic Needs (MBN) of the poor communities and disadvantaged sectors focusing on food security, sustainable development, low cost housing, good governance and peace and order.

To support the implementation of the Lingap Program, the Genera Appropriations Act of 1999 provides for a Lingap fund to be released to and managed by government agencies with major roles in addressing the MBNs of the poor. Likewise, Executive Order No. 92 provides for the guidelines and institutional arrangements for the management of the Lingap fund.

The Department of Health (DOH), as one of the implementing agencies of the Lingap Program, hopes to contribute in the poverty eradication efforts of government through the Food, Nutrition and Medical Assistance Program (FNMAP). The Program aims to increase access of the poorest of the poor families through better delivery of health services; and to strengthen collaboration between and among stakeholders for health (DOH, LGUs, NGOs, POs and Basic Sectors).

In order to ensure systematic and efficient management of the Food, Nutrition and Medical Assistance Program of the Lingap Program, including the utilization of its allotted fund, the development of policies and guidelines, thus, becomes necessary.

* The Project Menu for the Sustansiya Matching Grants are the following:

a) Complementary Feeding for the malnourished children

The community-based complementary feeding will ensure that malnourished children will have access to food supplements which will improve their nutritional status. This activity may also be used as a venue for other nutrition-related activities, such as: micronutrient supplementation for children, pregnant women, disabled and the elderly; weighing and growth monitoring of 0-24 months old children; cooking classes or demonstration for mothers; and emergency feeding during and after disasters (see attached food supplementation guidelines). Health and nutrition counseling and education may also form an integral part of this activity and health personnel may be tapped as resource persons.

b) Dietary Diversification/Backyard Gardening

To ensure availability of nutritious food in the local areas, community-based food diversification and backyard gardening maybe proposed. Enhancing community resources accessible to local households and managed by the community themselves will be an effective strategy to address lack of nutritious food among the poorest families. The municipal agriculturist may be tapped to provide technical assistance among the local proponents.

* The Matching Grants shall range from P50,000 to P100,000/area following an 80-20% cost-sharing from the Lingap Fund and the Project Proponent. The 20% counterpart of the Project proponent may include budgetary allocation in kind (goods such as food supplement, feeding equipment, etc.), services and staff time.
