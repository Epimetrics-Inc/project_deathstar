<subject>SUBJECT: Implementing Guidelines on Inﬂuenza and Pneumococcal Immunization for Indigent Senior Citizens </subject>


<body>
I. RATIONALE 

Inﬂuenza and pneumococcal disease together are responsible for hospitalizations, deaths and is a substantial disease burden worldwide. _ Most of the serious complications of these diseases occur among the elderly and other people with underlying chronic medical conditions. 

In most countries, majority of the cases of inﬂuenza occurs in the elderly. Observational studies from Europe, America and Asia have established that immunizing the elderly not only prevents direct outcomes of inﬂuenza infection and complications including hOSpitalization and death, but also direct outcomes, such as death from other causes or acceleration of the worsening condition of their health status. Meta-analyses of 20 cohort studies conducted between 1965 and 1991 add further support for the value of inﬂuenza immunization in the elderly, demonstrating prevention of respiratory illness by 56%, pneumonia by 53%, and hospitalization by 50% and death by 68%. Immunization is strongly recommended by the World Health Organization (WHO) and many national health authorities. 

The WHO estimates that more than 1.6 million people die from pneumococcal infections every year. It remains a major cause of mortality worldwide. Elderly subjects are most affected, with an incidence rate of 40 per 100,000 for people aged 80 — 85 years. Age- related impairment of the immune system and other defense mechanisms often compounded with decrease physical activity and poor nutrition increase the risk of severe pneumococcal disease in the elderly. Immunization remains the best preventive tool as the growing issue of antibiotic resistance often hampers treatment. In recognition of this tool, a growing number of countries and health bodies now recommend pneumococcal immunization of elderly and at-risk groups. Immunization with the 23-valent polysaccharide vaccine protects from invasive pneumococcal infections. WHO recommends the use of pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine for the elderly and other at-risk groups]. 

In February 2010, President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo signed into law Republic Act (RA) No. 9994, otherwise known as the “Expanded Senior Citizens Act (ESCA) of 2010”. It is an act granting additional beneﬁts and privileges to senior citizens, further amending RA No. 7432, otherwise known as “An Act to Maximize the Contribution of Senior Citizens to Nation Building, Grant Beneﬁts and Special Privileges and for Other Purposes”. 

Pursuant to Article II, Section 4 of RA 9994, the Department of Health (DOH) is mandated to procure pneumococcal and inﬂuenza vaccines to be administered for free to” indigent senior citizens in communities who are recipients of the Department of Social Welfare and Development’s National Household Targeting System for Poverty Reduction (DSWD - NHTS—PR) of the country. Senior citizens in government—run residential homes and facilities shall likewise be entitled to free immunizations under these Rules. 

To ensure an effective and efﬁcient management of routine immunization for the indigent senior citizens in all health units, government—run residential homes and facilities, this guideline is hereby developed. Consultations with the Health and Well—being of Older Persons (HWOP), Expanded Program for Immunization (EPI), National Epidemiology Center (NEC), National Center for Health Promotion (NCI-IP) and their regional/provincial and municipal counterparts will be done to warrant the successful implementation of this guideline. Likewise, coordination with other government ofﬁces like the DSWD and the Ofﬁce for Senior Affairs (OSCA), other Non-Governmental Organizations like the Coalition- of Citizens for the Elderly (COSE), National Federation of Senior Citizens’ Associations of the Philippines (NF SCAP), and Confederation of Older Persons Association of the Philippines (COPAP) among others will be done. 

II. SCOPE AND COVERAGE 

This order shall apply to all Centers for Health Development (CHD) of the DOH, city/municipal health centers, government  managed centers/residential institutions for senior citizens and other institutions providing immunization services for indigent senior citizens nationwide. 

III. PROGRAM GOAL 

1. To reduce the morbidity and mortality of indigent senior citizens against pneumonia and inﬂuenza diseases. 

2. To reduce transmission of resistant strains and pneumococcal resistance to antimicrobial drugs among indigent senior citizens. 

IV. DEFINITION OF TERMS 

For purposes of this Order, the following terms shall have the following deﬁnitions based on the Implementing Rules and Regulations of RA 9994.

SENIOR CITIZEN OR ELDERLY — refers to any Filipino citizen who is a resident of the Philippines, and who is sixty (60) years old or above. It may apply to senior citizens with “dual citizenship” status prOvided they prove their Filipino citizenship and have at least six (6) months residency in the Philippines. 

INDIGENT SENIOR CITIZEN — refers to any elderly who is frail, sickly, or with disability, and without pension or regular source of income, compensation or ﬁnancial assistance from his/her relatives to support his/her basic needs, as determined by the DSWD in consultation with the National Coordinating and Monitoring Board (NCMB). 

RESIDENTIAL CARE FACILITY — refers to a facility that provides twenty four (24) ' hour residential care services operated for the purpose of promoting the well being of abandoned, neglected, unattached or homeless senior citizens. The facility may be run by government or non- —stock non- proﬁt organization and IS accredited by the DSWD to serve a minimum of 10 clients. 

V. GENERAL GUIDELINES 

1. The DOH shall procure pneumococcal and inﬂuenza vaccines starting CY 2011 onwards and administer for FREE a yearly dose of inﬂuenza vaccine and a single dose of pneumococcal vaccine to all indigent senior citizens. 

2. The DOH shall calculate the pneumococcal and inﬂuenza vaccines based on the list of indigent senior citizens in the NHTS-PR of the DSWD, in residential care facility (ex: govemment—run residential facilities and in DSWD-accredited non-govemmental home care facilities), as stipulated under the RA 9994. 

3. Only health workers trained and skilled at giving injections are authorized by the DOH to give immunizations in designated city/municipal health centers, government- run residential facilities and DSWD—accredited non-governmental home care facilities for senior citizens. 

VI. IMPLEMENTING GUIDELINES 

1. Target setting 

A. Age Group 

A1. All indigent senior citizens 60 years of age and above should receive the following vaccines: 

i. One (1) dose of pneumococcal vaccine throughout his/her lifetime 

ii. One (1) dose of inﬂuenza vaccine every year 

A2. An indigent senior citizen who has received a penumococcal vaccine in the last 5 years and was &lt 60 years of age at the time of immunization should receive another close of pneumococcal vaccine. 

A3. An indigent senior citizen who has received a pneumococcal vaccine when he/she was 60 years old and above at the time of immunization is not required to receive another dose of pneumococcal vaccine. 

B. Geographical coverage 

B1. All indigent senior citizens 60 years old and above living in residential care facilities and in the communities identiﬁed. 

B2. All personnel and staff employed in residential care facilities. Vaccination of these employees against these diseases will ensure protection because they are constantly in contact with the senior citizens. 

C. Immunization Schedule 

Routine immunization activity will commence as soon as the vaccines are made available at the City/Municipal Health Centers. 

2. Immunization Strategy 

A. A facility-based (i.e. residential care facility, city/municipal health center) immunization strategy shall be the main strategy with a catch-up/mop-up vaccination to track those who were listed but did not come to the facility for vaccination or vaccination was temporarily deferred due to sickness. DOH hospitals will be alternative sites for immunization. 

B. Preparatory activities 4 weeks before the date of immunization 

1. Make a line list of target beneﬁciaries 

i. List the name of all indigent senior citizens 60 years of age and above living in residential care facilities, including all personnel and staff employed in the above residential care facilities. Use the Master List for Indigent Senior Citizen Recording Form (Annex 1). 

ii. List the name and address of all indigent senior citizens 60 years old and above living in communities based on the NHTS- PR of DSWD. Use the Master List for Indigent Senior Citizen Recording Form (Annex 2). 

2. Orient the target beneﬁciaries regarding when, where, how, what to do for the upcoming immunization activity. 

3. Vaccine Information 

A. Type of Vaccine 

1. Pneumococcal Polyvalent Vaccine 25 micrograms/0.5 mL (polysaccharide from each capsular type) in 0.5 pre-ﬁlled syringe. It is an inactivated vaccine containing twenty—three (23) killed pneumococcal strains. 

2. Inﬂuenza Polyvalent Vaccine 0.5 mL vial + pre-ﬁlled syringe diluent or 0.5 mL suspension in a pro-ﬁlled syringe or ampule. It contains three (3) killed inﬂuenza viruses. 

3. The CY 2011 supply of both the pneumococcal and inﬂuenza vaccines are in pre-ﬁlled syringe preparation. However, in future procurements, formulations may change as long as it is in the latest edition of the Philippine National Drug Formulary. 

B. Dosage 

1. The standard dosage is 0.5 mL Pneumococcal Polyvalent Vaccine and is given once in his/her lifetime. There is no need to re-vaccinate unless he/she has received pneumococcal vaccine in the last 5 years and was &lt 60 years old at the time of vaccination. 

2. The standard dosage is 0.5 mL Inﬂuenza Polyvalent Vaccine and is given every year because inﬂuenza viruses change from year to year. 

C. Route of Administration 

Simultaneous administration of pneumococcal and inﬂuenza vaccines is safe and effective during the same immunization schedule but at different sites (Left deltoid muscle — pneumococcal vaccine intramuscularly; Right deltoid muscle —- inﬂuenza vaccine intramuscularly). It is not recommended, however, to mix the 2 vaccines in one (1) syringe before injection. 

D. Vaccine Distribution, Storage and Handling 

1. Pneumococcal and Inﬂuenza vaccines procured by the DOH shall be stored at the Research Institute for Tropical Medicine (RITM). An allocation list of vaccines shall be submitted by the National Health and Well-being of Older Persons (HWOP) Program focal person to RITM for delivery and distribution to the different CHDs. The delivery and distribution of these vaccines shall follow the mechanism used by the EPI. 

2. The CHD —— HWOP will prepare the distribution list for the provincial/municipal/city health care centers based on the total estimated indigent senior citizens residing in residential care facilities and in communities. 

3. Pneumococcal and inﬂuenza vaccines shall be stored at temperatures between +2° to +8°C. Both vaccines should not be allowed to freeze. 

Inﬂuenza vaccines supplied by DOH comes with a “Vaccine Vial Monitor” (VVM). On the other hand, pneumococcal vaccine does not have a VVM. VVM should be regularly read before using the vacCine. 

4. Proper labeling of pneumococcal and inﬂuenza vaccines shall be done e.g. name of vaccine, expiry date, etc. 

5. Safe injection practices shall be strictly observed in the administration and disposal of these vaccines. 

E. Disposal of used syringes and needles 

1. All vaccination teams shall be provided with a safety collector box (SCB) to dispose the used vial/syringes, cotton and other immunization wastes. 

2. All health facilities shall identify areas for the temporary storage of the ﬁlled—SCB until its ﬁnal waste disposal as recommended in the EPI. 

3. The Sanitary Inspector (SI) shall ensure that such immunization wastes - shall be ﬁnally disposed in the recommended waste disposal method. - 

F. Contraindications 

Senior citizens with coronary heart disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, diabetes mellitus, dementia, stroke, malnutrition, chronic liver disease, chronic renal disease, use of immunosuppressive drugs because of cancer can still be given pneumococcal and inﬂuenza vaccines. 

There are no contraindications for the administration of pneumococcal and inﬂuenza vaccines. The only absolute contraindication to inﬂuenza vaccine is a known history of allergy to eggs and egg products (egg proteins), chicken feathers, vaccine components, antibiotics such as neomycin or polymyxin, latex gloves, or those currently taking steroids. 

For a senior citizen who has fever, signs of acute illness like cough, or any ﬂu-like illness or other pertinent signs and symptoms of an acute infection at the time of immunization, postponement of immunization is advised until the _ senior citizen has fully recovered from his/her acute illness. Thus, a quick health assessment by the health worker is required before administration of the vaccines. 

G. Possible mild and adverse events 

The risks from pneumococcal and inﬂuenza vaccines are similar to most inactivated vaccines, although not everybody gets them. 

Mild Events: 
- Injection-site abscess —— occurrence of a ﬂuctuant or draining ﬂuid-ﬁlled lesion at the site of injection with or without fever. 
- Lymphadenitis (includes supporative lymphadenitis) — occurrence of either: at least one lymph node, 1.5 cm in size (one adult ﬁnger width) or larger; or a draining sinus over a lymph node. 
- Severe local reaction — redness and/or swelling centered at the site of injection and one or more of the following: swelling beyond the nearest joint; pain, redness and swelling of more than 3 days duration; or requires hospitalization. 

These reactions usually begin soon after the immunization, can last from 1 — 2 days to 1 week after immunization and spontaneously disappear without treatment. 

The risk of any vaccine causing life threatening allergic reactions to the vaccine is extremely small. Although very rare, any one of the following signs has to be watched out for. 

Central Nervous System (CNS) Adverse Events: 
- Acute paralysis such as Guillain Barre Syndrome (GBS) — acute onset of rapidly progressive, ascending, symmetrical ﬂaccid paralysis, without fever at onset of paralysis and with sensory loss. 
- Encephalopathy - is an acute onset of major illness temporarily linked with immunization and characterized by any two of the following three conditions: seizures; severe alteration in level of consciousness lasting for 1 day or more; and distinct change in behavior lasting 1 day or more. 
- Encephalitis — is characterized by encephalopathy and signs of cerebral inﬂammation and, in many cases, CSF pleocytosis and/or virus isolation. 
- Meningitis —- acute onset of major illness with fever, neck stiffness/positive meningeal signs (Kernig, Brudzinski). Symptoms may be subtle to similar to those of encephalitis. 
- Seizures - lasting for several minutes to more than 15 minutes and not accompanied by focal neurological signs or symptoms. Febrile seizures or afebrile seizures. Onset is usually 0 to 2 days. 

Other Adverse Events: 

- Anaphylactoid Reaction (acute hypersensitivity reaction) — exaggerated acute reaction, occurring within 2 hours after immunization, characterized by one or more of the following: (1) wheezing and shortness of breath due to bronchospasm; (2) laryngospasm/laryngeal edema; (3) one or more skin manifestations, c.g. hives, facial edema, or generalized edema. ' 
- Neuritis - dysfunction of nerves supplying the arm/shoulder without other involvement of nervous system. A deep steady, often severe aching pain in the shoulder and upper arm followed by weakness and wasting in arm/shoulder muscles. Sensory loss maybe present, but is less prominent. May present on the same or the opposite site to the injection and sometimes affects both arms. Onset is usually 2 to 28 days. 
- Hypotensive-hyporesponsive episode (shock collapse) —— sudden onset of paleness, decrease level or loss of responsiveness, decrease level or loss of muscle tone (occurring within 24 hours of vaccination). The episode is transient and self—limiting. 
- Persistent screaming — inconsolable continuous crying lasting at least 3 hours accompanied by high pitched screaming. Onset 0 to 24 hours. 
- Sepsis — acute onset of severe generalized illness due to bacterial infection and conﬁrmed by positive blood culture. 
- Thrombocytopenia —— platelet count of 100,000 cells or less per mm3. Onset is 15 to 35 days. 
- Toxic shock syndrome — abrupt onset of fever, vomiting and watery— diarrhea within a few hours of immunization, often leading to death within 24 to 48 hours. 

If these adverse events do occur, it is usually within a few minutes to a few hours after the immunization. It is important to seek consult with a doctor, and inform him/her about the reaction, the date and time it happened, and when the vaccination was given. Appropriate medical treatment and supervision are readily available in case of anaphylactic reactions.

4. Calculation of Pneumococcal and Inﬂuenza Vaccine Needs 

Data required: 

A. Total number of indigent senior citizens in residential care facilities, including total number of personnel in residential care facilities. 

B. Total number of indigent senior citizens residing in all municipalities based on the NHTS-PR of the DSWD. A 

The formula is as follows: 

Annual vaccine required = A + B MULTIPLIED BY wastage factor (based on vaccine vial preparation). 

1. wastage factor of 1.1 or 10% (single dose vaccine vial) 
2. wastage factor of 1.25 or 20%(multi-dose vaccine vial) 

5. Vaccine Administration A. Vaccines shall cover all indigent senior citizens 60 years old and above living in: 

1. residential care facilities for indigent senior citizens 
2. in the community based on the NI-ITS-PR of the DSWD 

B. The City/Municipal/Provincial Health Ofﬁcer and CHD shall plan the immunization schedule for the residential care facility and for the community for senior citizens. 

C. Vaccinator teams that will be assigned to immunize senior citizens in residential care facilities shall get their vaccine allocation for the day in the CHO/MHO where the above center/residential institution is located. The vaccinator team shall get the vaccines and place it in a standard vaccine carrier prior to the immunization schedule. 

D. Remaining unused vaccines after immunization schedule shall be returned to the CHO/MHO at the end of the day and shall be used ﬁrst in the next immunization. 

1. Depending on the vaccine preparation, the following steps are to be undertaken: 

a. For any vaccine without VVM 

i. Any unopened vaccine vial that needs to be returned back to the health facility for storing shall be marked ‘X’ if ﬁrst time to be taken out. This ‘X’ marked vaccine should be allocated for use on the following day. 

ii. In case this unopened vaccine vial marked ‘X’ was not . again utilized at the end of the day and needs to be returned back to the health facility, marked this vaccine as ‘XX’ and shall be used ﬁrst the following day. 

6. Recording and Reporting Forms
