<subject>SUBJECT: Guidelines in the Inventories of Equipment, Semi-Expendable Supplies & Materials and Vehicles at the DOH Central Office Including proper recording of Memorandum Receipts (MR) and Property Management</subject>

<body>
I. RATIONALE:

In 1998 audit observation of the Commission on Audit (COA) reveals that for the past ten (10) years there was no systematic inventory taking conducted by the Department of Health, although a physical count was conducted in 1997, such was partial and limited only to office equipment and semi-expendable supplies and materials.
