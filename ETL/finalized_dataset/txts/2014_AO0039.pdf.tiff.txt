<subject>SUBJECT: Strengthening the capacity of LGUs in identifying potential Measles outbreak and planning for appropriate response</subject>
<body>
 

I. BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE 

During the last quarter of 2013 and ﬁrst quarter of 2014, the country observed high measles transmission in many provinces and cities resulting in increased measles incidence rates by the end of March 2014. Subsequently, the number of reported suspect measles cases increased and specimens submitted to the National Measles Reference Laboratory of the Research Institute for Tropical Medicine (NMRL/RITM) surpassed its capacity to conduct conﬁrmatory testing on all specimens. The above circumstances challenged the capacity of both the measles surveillance system and NMRL in providing timely epidemiologic data and laboratory results to conﬁrm the outbreak as well as local health workers to promptly implement appropriate response and control measures. 

II. OBJECTIVES 

1. Provide health workers guidance on responding to high transmission of measles in the community; and 

2. Establish epidemiological linkage of new cases in barangays with laboratory conﬁrmed case(s) following the representative sampling method adopted by the NMRL 

III. SCOPE AND COVERAGE

V. IMPLEMENTING MECHANISM 

OBJECTIVE 1. PROVIDE HEALTH WORKERS GUIDANCE ON RESPONDING TO HIGH TRANSMISSION OF MEASLES IN THE COMMUNITY 

Health workers at all levels are encouraged to follow these basic steps in outbreak response: 



-Investigate and isolate suspected measles case(s) in the household 

-Obtain appropriate blood specimens for laboratory conﬁrmation 

-Inform health authorities 

-Assess immunization coverage in affected and surrounding barangays by conducting a rapid convenience survey 

-Ensure appropriate case management, including Vitamin A administration in an age-appropriate dose 

-Provide measles vaccine to unvaccinated household and community contacts Implement active case search in the community and nearby health facilities Alert surveillance focal points 

-Monitor, analyze and prepare outbreak summary report 


1.A ISOLATION INSTRUCTIONS 

-At home, isolate the suspected measles case and limit contact with other household members whenever possible until ﬁve days after the rash appears. 
-Suspected measles cases should not be hospitalized unless necessary (e.g. when complications develop such as pneumonia or severe diarrhea). 
-In schools, suspected measles cases should be sent home and parents should be advised to keep the child at home for ﬁve days. 
-At the hospital, isolate suspected measles cases in isolation ward/room from rash onset up to 5 days to prevent nosocomial spread. 

INVESTIGATION INSTRUCTIONS 


-All Disease Surveillance Ofﬁcers and Coordinators should report cases based on the standard measles case deﬁnition (rash, fever and either cough, coryza or conjunctivitis). 

-All disease reporting units, including private clinics and facilities and the community are encouraged to report suspected measles cases to the concerned regional, provincial or city epidemiology and surveillance unit. 

-Each suspected measles case should be completely investigated using the standard measles-rubella CIF (Annex A). 

-Collect serum/ dried blood spot (DBS) sample from ALL cases in a barangay with only 1-5 suspected measles cases. If the number of cases exceeds 5, collect at least 5 serum/DBS samples per barangay. 

-Wen the number of cases exceeds the level where completing the CIF is operationally feasible due to limited resources, case investigators should collect at least the 10 core variables (information items) required to allow for meaningful epidemiological analysis to guide health workers in implementing appropriate measles outbreak response measures. 

-Core variables/information to be collected from suspected measles cases in all barangays where measles transmission is observed, especially in barangays where high measles transmission is occurring: 
 - case identiﬁcation 

— date of birth/age 

- sex 

- place of residence 

- vaccination status or date of last vaccination 

- date of rash onset 

- date of notiﬁcation 

- date of investigation 

- date of blood specimen collection 

- place of infection and travel history 


-Collect information about the measles immunization status from all suspected measles cases, especially if the case is an under-ﬁve child. If the investigator failed to collect this data or the case is found to be unimmunized, the investigator(s) must immediately inform the local EPI coordinator and encourage to validate the information and to immunize the case as needed. 

1.C. CROSS NOTIFICATION 


-Health workers at all levels should immediately be oriented and involved in all aspects of the outbreak response. 

-Health workers of neighboring barangays should be notiﬁed so that they will begin implementing preventive actions as necessary. 

-The public should be informed through the media about the outbreak and any protective measures that they can take. 

-If a suspected case has traveled or has close contact with individuals from other barangays of the country 7-21 days before the onset of the illness, the D80 in those barangays should be notiﬁed immediately. 

1.D. MEASLES CASE MANAGEMENT 

-All suspect cases with clinical manifestation of measles, e.g. maculopapular rash, high fever (238 C) accompanied by either cough, runny nose or red eyes, should receive recommended age-speciﬁc Vitamin A dosage. 
-Administration of Vitamin A is the standard of care in measles case management. 
-Vitamin A supplementation has been shown to reduce all-cause mortality by 23%-30%. 
-Health workers are encouraged to include Vitamin A administration in the immunization response activity whenever possible if adequate supply is available. 

1.E MEASLES VACCINATION 

-Close contacts (persons living in the same household or other close quarters: classroom, dormitory, etc.) without evidence of measles immunity should immediately be vaccinated, regardless of age. They should also be instructed about the symptoms of measles and practice isolation as described above if symptoms appear. 
-The immunization response for each scenario is dependent on the availability and timeliness of information about laboratory conﬁrmed measles cases. 
-In the absence of a laboratory conﬁrmed measles case but with evidence of an increasing number of suspected measles cases, local health workers can adopt the recommended immunization response to a “one conﬁrmed measles casein a barangay.” 
-Follow the recommended guidelines for an effective and efﬁcient community outbreak response immunization. The guideline is only for using measles containing vaccine. Standard guidelines must be followed should local health workers decide to include other interventions (e.g. Vitamin A administration, OPV, etc.) in the response (Annex B). 

1.F INTENSIFY MEASLES SURVEILLANCE 


-Measles surveillance should be intensiﬁed to search for additional suspected cases. 

-For every chain (date of rash onset of cases fall within an interval of 7—21 days from each other) of conﬁrmed measles cases, at least 5 representative nasopharyngeal or oropharyngeal swab samples should be collected for laboratory measles viral isolation and allowing identiﬁcation of the circulating measles virus strain. 

-Ideally the nasopharyngeal or oropharyngeal swabs should be collected from cases within seven days of rash onset. Whereas, serum IgM or DBS for measles-speciﬁc IgM is more likely to be positive if collected between 4-28 days after rash onset. Specimens for IgM testing and for virus isolation should be collected during the ﬁrst contact. Specimens for virus isolation and for IgM testing do not need to be collected from the same cases during an outbreak investigation. 

-All reporting units should be notiﬁed once a measles outbreak is suspected and be alerted to be vigilant for additional cases. 

-Health workers and public should be encouraged to report cases. 

-The public should be informed where to report cases and where to get information for measles prevention and control. 

1.G OUTBREAK MONITORING AND SUMMARY REPORTING 

-All epidemiology and surveillance units should aim to update their measles database regularly. At least one staff in each unit should be assigned for this purpose. 
-Surveillance data should be analyzed using the most updated information. 
-Data should be analyzed for both suspected, clinically—compatible, and conﬁrmed measles cases. 
-Basic weekly analysis should include the following: 

- Distribution of cases by case classiﬁcation. Epidemiologically-linked cases should be determined as soon as a laboratory conﬁrmed measles case is identiﬁed. 
- Distribution of cases by morbidity week and place 
- Age distribution of cases and immunization status 
- Patterns of transmission, including travel and exposure history 
- Measles incidence and case fatality ratio 
- Immunization response activities 



-When no new case is reported during a three-week period, despite the presence of intensiﬁed surveillance, the outbreak may be considered to be over. 
-It is recommended for each epidemiology and surveillance unit with catchment barangays affected by the outbreaks to prepare and share a summary report to document the outbreak including lessons learned, best practices and recommendations that could be useful in improving the country’s measles elimination strategies. 

OBJECTIVE 2. ESTABLISH EPIDEMIOLOGICAL LINKAGE OF NEW CASES IN BARANGAYS WITH LABORATORY CONFIRMED CASEtS) FOLLOWING THE REPRESENTATIVE SAMPLING METHOD ADOPTED BY THE NMRL 

The guidelines described in this section are temporary and applicable ONLY in the situation of widespread measles transmission. When faced with a high incidence of measles, strategic collection of blood samples is essential to conserve valuable staff time and lessen the overload of specimens in the laboratory. Once a reference sample has been conﬁrmed positive for either measles or rubella IgM, health care providers can redirect their time and effort in conducting a high-quality ﬁeld investigation to search for other cases, epidemiologically-link other suspected cases to a known laboratory-conﬁrmed measles or rubella case and conduct an appropriate and timely outbreak and immunization response. 

Once the measles transmission has been controlled and the number of suspected measles cases is signiﬁcantly reduced, it is important to follow the guidelines in AO. No. 2014—0003, which requires collection of serum/DBS samples from EVERY suspected measles case. This will facilitate conﬁrmation of the end of a measles outbreak. This approach also applies when sporadic measles cases are observed. 

Please be reminded that once the country enters the measles elimination phase, it is highly recommended that ALL reported suspect measles cases are completely investigated and have blood specimens collected for laboratory conﬁrmation. 

2.A. ESTABLISHING EPIDEMIOLOGICAL LINKAGE 

A measles case conﬁrmed by epidemiological linkage to a laboratory- conﬁrrned case or epidemiologically—linked case is a suspected measles case with a credible mode of transmission from a laboratory-conﬁrmed case or (in the event of a chain of transmission) to another epidemiologically-conﬁrmed case seven to 21 days prior to rash onset. 

How should a “credible mode of transmission ” be understood? 

Cases must be linked geographically and temporally, although the contact details may not always be proven and sometimes must be assumed. Measles virus spreads very rapidly and people may be completely unaware that they have been in contact with infected persons who have not yet developed a rash. The following situations are all credible and should be considered: 


-A case in the same village or urban community; 

-A case in a neighbouring community with contact occurring through schools, markets and social events; 

-A case who has travelled to a country known to have measles circulating during the past seven to 21 days; and 

-A case having visited a health facility where a conﬁrmed case is known to have occurred. 

Who should perform epidemiological linking of measles cases? 

- A barangay with no laboratory-conﬁrmed measles case: 

- Depending on which unit is responsible for the barangay where the cases were reported, the provincial, municipal or city epidemiology and surveillance unit (MHO/PHO/CHO) shall be responsible for determining if the cases are epidemiologically-linked to conﬁrmed measles or other epidemiologically-linked measles cases from neighboring barangays or municipalities where laboratory-conﬁrmed cases are identiﬁed. 

- As the MHO/PHO/CHO has access to the measles database of the whole municipality, province or city, it has the ability to determine which of the newly reported cases are epidemiologically-linked to the laboratory-conﬁrmed measles cases from other areas by reviewing individual case’s core information (e.g. date of onset, exposure and travel history). 

- The MHO/PHO/CHO can also use maps to plot all the cases reported in their whole catchment area to determine patterns of transmission, population density and mobility, immunization data, etc., which could help identify outbreak risks and measles transmission chains. 

- A barangay with at least one known laboratory-conﬁrmed measles case: 

- If a barangay has at least one known laboratory-conﬁrmed measles case, the ﬁeld investigation team or responsible disease surveillance ofﬁcer should already determine if the new cases currently being investigated are epidemiologically—linked to that case or other previously identiﬁed epidemiologically-linked cases in the same barangay. 

2.B. SELECTION OF REPRESENTATIVE SPECIMENS FOR LABORATORY CONFIRMATION OF MEASLES OUTBREAK/CASES 

The NMRL is committed in providing timely laboratory results to guide planning for an effective and efﬁcient outbreak immunization response with implementation of. appropriate control measures. However, due to the limited ELISA test kits and overwhelming number of. specimens being submitted for conﬁrmatory testing, the NMRL has suggested a plan for prioritizing samples to be tested using a simple method of selection. The selected samples represent certain barangays and would allow efﬁcient epidemiological linking of suspected measles cases without specimens. 

2.C. CLASSIFYING SUSPECTED MEASLES CASES WITH UNTESTED SPECIMEN 

Having a reference laboratory-conﬁrmed measles case is necessary to facilitate epidemiological linkage. Therefore, while the laboratory test results of the selected specimen for priority testing are still pending, it is recommended that suspected measles cases with serum/DBS samples will be temporarily classiﬁed as clinically-measles compatible cases if they belong to a barangay where representative samples were selected for priority testing. Once the test results of the representative samples are available, these cases will be reviewed and reclassiﬁed as follows: 

- Epidemiologically-linked cases — if the representative samples are positive for measles IgM and the criteria for epidemiologically-linked case is met. 

- Clinically-Measles Compatible eases — this will be the ﬁnal classiﬁcation if the representative samples are negative for measles and rubella IgM even if the criteria for epidemiological linkage are met. These cases will not be discarded as non-measles/non-rubella due to epidemiological linkage to a case that tested negative for measles/ rubella IgM. 

Following standard protocol, all reported cases with negative measles IgM test results shall be re-tested by the NMRL for presence of rubella IgM. Based on the results, cases will be classiﬁed as either conﬁrmed rubella or discarded non- measles/non-rubella. The same standard protocol applies to reported cases whose specimens were prioritized but tested negative for measles IgM. 

2.D. STRATEGIC APPROACH TO SERUlVI/DBS COLLECTION DURING HIGH MEASLES TRANSMISSION 

In line with the above mentioned strategy, it is recommended that specimen collection be done strategically to facilitate the process of epidemiological linkage of measles cases, particularly in provinces and cities with high measles transmission (e.g. multiple barangays with more than one laboratory-conﬁrmed measles case in several municipalities, provinces and/or cities) without overwhelming the NMRL's capacity to test specimens and provide timely test results. Please refer to the table below for the supplemental guidelines that apply ONLY during a period of high and widespread measles transmission. 

 
 <image>table_1.png</image>
 <image>table_2.png</image>

 

The details of recent travels and contact tracing will be very important in establishing epidemiological linkage and probable source of infection. Integration of strong epidemiological information is achieved through conducting a high-quality ﬁeld investigation. 

In barangays where the surveillance system is inadequate to promptly identify and investigate cases, or when specimen collection is not possible, epidemiological linking may be done at the municipal or city level provided a laboratory-conﬁrmed case(s) exists in a neighboring barangay and there is sufﬁcient evidence of epidemiological linkage among cases. Oftentimes, plotting cases in a map and tracking transmission chains are helpful to support this process. 

Furthermore, ensuring the collection of the 10 core variables/information from every suspected measles case will support proper case classiﬁcation and data analysis to help decision makers in planning for appropriate immunization response. 

2.E. ROLES AND RESPONSIBILITIES 

As previously mentioned, this issuance is developed to provide guidance to health workers at different levels to timely and effectively carry out interventions to contain an outbreak and prevent further transmission. Some items contained in this guideline apply only during a high level of measles transmission in the community (Annex C). As signiﬁcant reduction in measles transmission is expected after the conduct of a nationwide measles-rubella mass immunization (that will also include administration of OPV) in September 2014, health workers are encouraged to exercise tact in deciding which activities are to be carried out based on the local situation. 

Once a low measles transmission is achieved, the country will shift to recommended measles elimination strategies where each case is required to be completely investigated and collected with appropriate specimen for measles conﬁrmation and genotyping. Likewise, during an elimination phase, one laboratory conﬁrmed case is considered an outbreak and appropriate measures must be carried out to prevent further spread of measles in the community. A.O. No. 2014-0003 provides guidance on laboratory conﬁrmation of measles case' during measles elimination phase. 

VI. REPEALING CLAUSE The provisions of previous Orders and other related issuances inconsistent or contrary with the provisions of this Administrative Order are hereby revised, modiﬁed, repealed or rescinded accordingly. All other provisions of existing issuances which are not affected by this Order shall remain valid and in effect.
