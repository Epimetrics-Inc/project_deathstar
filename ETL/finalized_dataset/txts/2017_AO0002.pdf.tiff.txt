<body>
I. RATIONALE 

The Responsible Parenthood and Reproductive Health Act of 2012 (RPRH Act) declares that the State shall guarantee “universal access” to reproductive health care services, methods, devices and supplies with “preferential access” to those identiﬁed through the National Household Targeting System for Poverty Reduction (N HTS-PR) and other government measures of identifying marginalization, who are expected to be “voluntary beneﬁciaries of reproductive health care, services and supplies given for free” (See. 2 Declaration of Policy). 

According to the latest data from the Philippine Statistics Authority (PSA), there are approximately 16.18 million married women of reproductive age (MWRA, age 15-49) and 0.31 million sexually active unmarried women (SAUW) in the country. Of these women, PSA’s 2013 National Demographic and Health Survey (NDHS 2013) estimates that around 10.62 million have a continuing demand or need for Family Flaming (FP). In sum, providing “universal access” to modern FP entails planning, organizing, budgeting for and serving the needs of around 10.62 million women; while ensuring “preferential access” for just the poorest two quintiles (40%) will require serving the needs of 4.25 million women. 

In order to provide millions of couples and individuals the means to make their FP decisions a reality, important mechanisms in the RPRH Act must be linked together, scaled up and operationalized. Speciﬁcally, the RPRH Act: 

- requires the DOH to procure, distribute and monitor the usage of FF supplies for the whole country (Sec. 10. Procurement and Distribution of Family Flaming Supplies); 
- requires all accredited public health facilities to provide a full range of modern FP methods (Sec. 7. Access to Family Planning); 
- mandates the DOH in coordination with PhilHealth to facilitate the involvement and participation of NGOs and the private sector in RH care service delivery and in the production, distribution and delivery of quality RH and PP supplies and commodities to make them accessible and affordable to ordinary citizens (Sec. 19. Duties and Responsibilities); and 
- opens up the establishment of Mobile Health Care Service (MHCS) in the form of a van or other means of transportation appropriate to the terrain, to deliver health 'care goods and services to LGU constituents, more particularly to the poor and needy (Sec. 13. Mobile Health Care Service). 

Mechanisms should be in place to ensure that DOH supplies, PhilHealth funds, and-contingency funds for emergencies ﬂow systematically andefﬁciently to support and promote better access to FF services by engaging and collaborating with civil society organizations (CSOs), non- government organizations (NGOs) and private facilities providing RH service and commodities towards standardized quality care and inclusiveness at all levels of health care. 

II. OBJECTIVES 

A. General

Private facilities who wishes to provide BTL and other surgical procedures shall apply for a License to Operate (LTO) to Health Facility and Service Regulation Bureau. Further, this Order pertains to facilities only and does not change or restrict the scope of practice of individual healthcare' providers who will still be governed by speciﬁc laws, regulations and codes of conduct and ethics of their particular profession.
