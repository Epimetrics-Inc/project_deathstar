I. Rationale

To ensure the accomplishment of the CY 2003 Work and Financial Plan for the Department of Health as formulated on the basis of Administrative Order No. 184 s. 2002, a workshop on WFP reconciliation was conducted last February 5 - 6, 2003.

c. Protecting citizens from fake, substandard products and services
d. Making primary, secondary and tertiary care services, as appropriate, more accessible to underserved communities (urban and rural).
e. Enabling citizens to live healthy lifestyles as individuals, families and communities.

2. In finalizing the WFP, the plan should program activities within the budget allocation for each Bureau/Office/Center in the General Appropriations Bill (Annex 1). The Plan should consider the aggregate of the 1st and 2nd preference appropriations, to assume that the bUdget will be released fully (up to the 2nd preference).

3. In the event that the 1st preference and/or only 75% of the programmed amount is released as prescribed for in CY 2002 in the National Budget Circular No. 478, each office and hospital must identify activities that can be cancelled (C), continued with efficiency measures (E) or continued with reduced targets (R). These should be marked in the 1st column of the WFP Form 2. Activities marked with "C", "E" and "R" must be placed at the last portion of the WFP matrix.

4. For central office units and Centers for Health Development (excluding hospitals) the 10% MOOE management reserve shall be labeled as Management Reserve for Emergency and Contingency Measures. This should be placed on the last portion of the WFP matrix.

5. All hospitals shall set aside 5% of their total MOOE for disease prevention and health promotion, disaster and emergency activities.

Targets enumerated in D.M. 153 s. 2002, additional and revised targets for public health, hospital, GMA 50 and management systems reforms in the health sector are found in Annex 2 of this Order. Additional and revised targets are shaded gray for easier recognition.

8. For the reorganized regions in Mindanao (Executive Order # 36 dated September 19, 2001), targets should reflect the new Mindanao set-up.

9. To facilitate assessment of plans, a summary of cost (WFP Form 1a) shall be included in the submission.
