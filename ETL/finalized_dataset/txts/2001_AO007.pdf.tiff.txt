<subject>SUBJECT: Implementing Guidelines for the Provision of Grants and Technical Assistance in Support to the Implementation of the Sentrong Sigla Movement 2002</subject>

<body>

A. Rationale/Background

The Sentrong Sigla Movement (SSM) is a philosophy that promotes individuals, families and communities as “Centers of Vitality,” an approach that empowers individuals and groups to adopt healthy lifestyles and demand for quality health services, a movement for social change and is a program for quality assurance for public health facilities. The objective of SSM is to foster better and more effective collaboration between the DOH and LGUs, where the DOH serves as the provider of technical and ﬁnancial assistance packages for health care and the LGUs as prime developers of health systems and direct implementers of health programs. Through SSM, LGUs are able to develop and improve their local health facilities and build local human resource capacities. These improvements will contribute to the attainment of health sector reforms.

To achieve this objective, the Grants and Technical Assistance Pillar of the SSM aims to pool available resources and to systematize the provision of resources to LGUs.

Specifically, the Grants and Technical Assistance Pillar aims to:

- Develop the capacity of LGUs to deliver essential and high quality health services that meet national standards and in line with local priorities;

- Establish local health systems;

- Strengthen linkages between and among DOH, local governments, and other
sectors; and

- Promote the localization of local health programs.

This administrative issuance intends to systematize the provision of all forms of assistance provided by DOH or through DOH to help LGUs meet the objectives of SSM.

B. COVERAGE

All local government units (LGUs) whether Province, Municipality or City requesting assistance from the DOH Central Ofﬁce or CHD starting Year 2001 for purposes consistent with the objectives cf SSM shall be covered by the stipulations of this Administrative Order.

C. Guiding Principles

The following guiding principles are to be taken into consideration in providing assistance to LGUs under SSM and 1n reviewing project proposals submitted by LGUs for the purpose of securing any form of assistance covered by this set of Guidelines.

1. The assistance shall be responsive and sensitive to local needs.
2. The assistance shall contribute to the attainment of the national objectives for health and in consonance with the objectives of SSM.
3. The assistance shall be 1n consonance with the LGU’s Integrated Health Plan.
4. The aissistance shall promote integration of health services.
5. The assistance shall foster equity among LGUs.
6. The assistance shall encourage cost sharing and counterparting.

D. General Guidelines

1. Three forms of grants may be made available to Local Government Units (LGUs) under SSM. These are (1) Cash Grants, (2) In-Kind/Commodity Grants, and (3) Technical Assistance. The details of each of these grants are discussed in Annex A Section A.

2. All forms of cash grants provided to LGUs shall be accompanied by a technical assistance package which will take any of two forms: (1) Quality Improvement Package and (2) Social Health Insurance Package.

3. To secure the assistance described in items 1 and 2 above, LGUs should submit a project proposal to the Center for Health Development (CHD) following a prescribed format. The project proposal should be baSed on the LGU’s Strategic Health Plan.

4. No limit is set as to the number of project proposals which can be submitted by each LGU. The CHD, however, shall allow only one proposal per LGU to be extended with the necessary assistance per implementation year to ensure that all LGUs with acceptable project proposals are given equal opportunity to access resources.

5. A special committee will be created, reactivated (if already existing but no longer functional), or reconstituted (if functional but without the proper representation from Certain sectors) by the CHD to review and recommend for approval all submitted project proposals.

The special committee shall have representation from the academe, the private sector, other government agencies, NGOs and the community.

The LGU need to inform only the CHD if the extension required will'only be for a period of three months or less.

LGUs shall not be precluded to submit project proposals which are to be implemented beyond a one-year period. But the assistance for the succeeding implementation years shall be requested by the proponent LGU annually and subject to the same review process described In D.4 above.

Step 7: During the same period of MOA preparation, the LHAD shall prepare an Assistance Plan which will identify at the very least the schedulefor grant release and the sources of each grant. This plan shall be disseminated to all concerned ofﬁces and groups 0 trigger them to prepare their corresponding schedule to meet and satisfy their respective contributions in each of the approved project proposal. Likewise, a cash program will be prepared by the CHD to meet the funding requirement for cash grant assistance.
