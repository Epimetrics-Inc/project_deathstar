<subject>SUBJECT: Implementing Rules and Regulations of Republic Act No. 9421, Otherwise Known as “An Act Upgrading the Valenzuela General Hospital in the City of Valenzuela, Metro Manila into a Two Hundred (200) Bed Capacity Tertiary Level Hospital to be known as the Valenzuela Medical Center”. </subject>


<body>
I. RATIONALE/BACKGROUND 

The Valenzuela Medical Center (VMC) formerly Valenzuela General Hospital (VGH), is a Level IV tertiary, teaching and training hospital with 100 authorized beds mandated by virtue of RA 7218 of 1992. However, due to its big catchment population from Valenzuela City,its primary catchment area, and the Cities of Malabon, Navotas and the neighboring town of Obando and the City of Meycauayan in the Province of Bulacan, another Law was passed in 2007, RA No. 9421, Otherwise knOwn as “An Act Upgrading the Valenzuela General Hospital in the City of Valenzuela, Metro Manila into Two Hundred (200) Bed Capacity Tertiary Level Hospital to be known as the Valenzuela Medical Center. ” 

With its current bed capacity of 100, VMC, has a bed population ratio of 1 bed for every 1,548 (primary catchment area) and 122,225 population (secondary catchment area). The ideal bed population ratio of the Department of Health (in general) is 121,000; and the World Health Organization (WHO) standard is 1 bed for every 500 population. 

For the past five years (2005-2009), VMC statistics show an average bed occupancy rate of 120%. This is beyond the Department of Health standard of 80%-85% occupancy rate for a hospital to be effectively and efficiently functional. The record shows an urgent need to increase the number of beds of Valenzuela Medical Center from 100 beds to 200 beds as mandated by RA 9421 (see Annex A). Furthermore, it is noteworthy that majority of its admitted patients are service patients classiﬁed as Class C, D and E based, on DOH A.O. No. Sl-A s. 2001 re: Implementing Guidelines on Classiﬁcation of Patients and Availment of Medical Social Service in a Government Hospital. 

Being a tertiary Level IV hospital, VMC caters to catastrophic cases in addition to a mix of other cases. Thus there is need for adequate number of health human resources with appropriately developed capabilities and skills for the hospital to achieve its goals and objectives which is more than quality patient care. The existing 191 plantilla positions at VMC are inadequate for its current bed capacity and occupancy rate. 

Therefore, it is critical to implement this Republic Act No. 9421 to effectively provide quality health care, as it is the policy of the state to “protect and promote the right to health of the people and instill health consciousness among them” (Sec. 15. Art. 11. Philippine Constitution).
