SUBJECT: 

I- Background/ Rationale

The 1994 International Conference on Population and Development (ICPD) emphasizes the link between population and sustainable development and recommends a comprehensive approach in formulating and implementing reproductive health policies and programs. Moreover, the 1995 International Conference on Women in Beijing, highlighted that empowering women is the key to a healthy and productive lives and called for the promotion of a reproductive health approach.

The Philippines as signatory to the Programme of Action of the ICPD subscribes to a consensus which include the broadening of population policies and programs beyond family planning and a much closer collaboration among development agencies as the primary mechanism to attain the reproductive health approach objectives. In line with this, the DOH has created the Philippine RH Program thru the Administrative Order # 1—As 1998 dated January 15, 1998.

To strengthen the program, there is a need to refocus the implementation of RH thru the following approaches:

1. Integrating services, emphasizing quality and expanding coverage through partnership with local government units, non-governmental organizations and the private sectors within the framework of the Health Sector Reform Agenda.

2. Reproductive Health Theme will create an environment for participation of stakeholders in the health—sector to provide clients with high quality care by considering their perspective in the selection and delivery of services.

It will address the reproductive health needs not only of women and children but also the underserved groups such as men and adolescents. Special attention will be given to marginalized groups especially the poor.

Integration of RH services in all health facilities as part of a basic package of health services and ensuring a referral system between primary to tertiary, public and private facilities, will result in greater efficiency and effectiveness by requiring fewer provider—client contacts, sharing of facilities, and minimizing duplication.

Reproductive Health Theme will also strive toward national self-reliance in providing services, medicines and supplies to support reproductive health services in the Philippines. Reforms in health financing for reproductive health will be a priority.

2. Improving the general health of all Filipinos, promoting personal responsibility and empowering communities to exercise reproductive health rights within the framework of the National Objectives for Health.

Reproductive Health will be consistent with national programs to improve the health of Filipinos in general by promoting personal responsibility, disseminating information and emphasizing freedom of choice in accessing to programs, services and information.

It recognizes that the goals of reproductive health cannot be achieved independent of national goals and objectives for health in general. Hence, reproductive health will be seen as a fundamental part of basic health services and the exercise of reproductive rights will be promoted to empower individuals and communities to actively participate in achieving reproductive health goals and objectives.


II- Reproductive Health Framework

The ICPD defines Reproductive Health (RH), as a “state of complete physical, mental and social well being and not merely the absence of disease or infirmity, in all matters relating to the reproductive system and to its functions and processes.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

The challenge posed by the shift of global policies towards a reproductive health (RH) perspective through the 1994 International Conference on Population and Development (ICPD) emphasizes the link between population and sustainable development and recommends a comprehensive approach in formulating and implementing reproductive health policies and programs. Moreover, the 1995 International Conference on Women in Beijing, highlighted that empowering women is the key to a healthy and productive lives and called for the promotion of a reproductive health approach.

The Philippines as signatory to the Programme of Action of the ICPD subscribes to a consensus which include the broadening of population policies and programs beyond family planning and a much closer collaboration among development agencies as the primary mechanism to attain the reproductive health approach objectives. In line with this,
the DOH has created the Philippine RH Program through: the Administrative Order # 1—As 1998 dated January 15,1998.

As a continuing response, the Family Planning/Reproductive Health program of the Department of Health, initiated a number of activities to ensure the functionality of the RH program. Foremost of which is the conduct of the RH policy development. This workshop provided us with an opportunity to review existing RH/FP policies and identified policy gaps.

Among the policy issues pointed out are:

* Lack of integrated RH framework which affect the mainstreaming of RH
* The need to shift demographic target setting to promotion of reproductive health
* Lack of commitment from NGO and the need to address RH concern through a multi-sectoral effort
* The right of the individual vs. the state whose interest shall prevail
* Reproductive Health linkage with population and sustainable development

The body also agree that most of the policies deal with operational issues which was laid out in the reproductive health policy framework (see attached).

The participants were also able to draw up suggestions for the successful implementation of the national reproductive health policy through the recommendation of the following strategic directions, foremost of which are: 

1. Sustainable Development as Driving Force where the

2. RH should be part of a comprehensive health care package

3. Implementing a gender responsive and equitable RH program

4. Strategic Leadership, Partnership and Linkages for Financing will work for the following:

* Alternative Networking will be pursued to :
— Ensure convergence with other concerned agencies i.e. other agencies of the government, LGUs, NGOS, professional groups, people’s organization financing institution 
- Creation of task forces/Inter—agency committees with shared commitment and responsibilities
- Review and establish sound implementing mechanism

* Institutional Development

* Advocacy 

* Community Organizing

5. Women—centered and community—based implementation of programs

* Establish a paradigm shift in the understanding and practice of health beyond the biomedical perspective

* DOH should encourage and support modeling of community—based family health manager 

* Establish and support community-based family developers and organizers  

* Implement a widespread grass-root women’s health education

* Implementing women centered health services, sevicers and facilities

* Mobilize multi-sectoral support for community and family health development

PREAMBLE

1. The country’s development is reflected in the quality of life of its citizens. Its effective pursuit is premised on:

a. The achievement of individual goals and aspirations towards the pursuit of societal objectives that also ensure the well-being of future generations;

b. Shared aspirations, where people empowerment is a major objective and a necessary means

c. The empowerment of women and the improvement of their political, social, economic and health status that is essential to its fulfillment

2. Individual development can best be achieved by more sustainable patterns of production and consumption; managed population growth; poverty alleviation; social and economic equality; and gender equity and equality. 

3. We must focus on the individual as the center of development since past population policies, which were primarily macro-level and demographically driven, achieved only moderate success. 

4. Gender equity and equality are essential for individual empowerment. Current gender roles and status in the Philippines are adversely affecting women’s health and her contribution and participation to our country’s growth. This gender inequity exacerbates the cultural stereotyping and social pressures on women making the effects of poverty and violence more profound on them.

5. Reproductive well being is a major component of women’s health. In turn, reproductive health is an integral aspect of this well - being. Women’s health and reproductive health is a multi-sectoral effort.

6. Reproductive health is a state of complete physical, mental and social well- being and not merely the absence of illness in all matters related to the reproductive system and its processes. In view of the critical importance of gender considerations, freedom from violence in all its forms, from constricting social roles and from disempowering relationships are important in the pursuit of reproductive health

Reproductive health therefore supports the rights of individuals to have a satisfying and safe sex life and coupes to have the capability to reproduce and the freedom to decide if, when and how often to do so.

7. Reproductive health consists of the following elements: Family Planning; Maternal and Child Health and Nutrition; Prevention and management of Abortion and its complications; Prevention and treatment of RTIs; Education and counseling on sexuality and sexual health; Breast and RT cancers and other gynecological conditions; Male reproductive health involvement; Violence against women; Adolescent reproductive health; and Prevention and treatment of infertility and sexual disorders. 

Sexual health consists of: Protection from RTIs; Protection from harmful practices and violence; Control over sexual relations; sexual enjoyment; and responsible sexuality. 

8. Reproductive health also recognizes the right and responsibility of men for their own sexual and reproductive behavior as well as their social and family roles particularly in the promotion of the reproductive health of their partners.

9. Recognizing all the above, a Reproductive Health Policy is necessary to promote women’s health and development as a goal in itself. Achieving this will lead to sustainable development of the Philippines. The formulation of this policy occurs during a defining moment in crafting a Philippine development plan that emphasizes the importance of human resource development.


GUIDING PRINCIPLES

1. The implementation of this Reproductive Health policy is a commitment of the Department of Health supported by all agencies of the government. This policy is in consonance with the Constitution and the fundamental laws of the land and respects the social and cultural values of the Filipinos. 

2. All human beings are born equal, vested from birth with universal and inalienable rights. This shall be respected and ensured without discrimination of any kind regardless of the individual’s race, color, sex, language, religion, political or other opinion, national, ethnic, or social origin, property, disability, birth or other status. Everyone has the right to life, health, education, development and security of person. 

3. Every individual has a right to a healthy and productive life co—existing in an environment that nurtures and cares, where both men and women are mutually supportive and responsive to the needs and decisions of each other. 

4. Population and development policies must respond to current realities, giving emphasis to the reproductive health needs of individuals.

5. Women’s empowerment is a cornerstone of sustainable development and results in the improvement of their political, social, economic, and health status. Population and development policy therefore must be pursued with the full participation of women. 

6. Basic to the attainment of RH goals and objectives are the rights of men and women to have access to safe, effective, affordable and socially and culturally acceptable health care services that will enable men and women to fulfill their reproductive health aspirations.

7. All Filipinos are producers and providers of health. All factors that affect their individual and community health are their responsibility. Solely putting the burden on women is unsustainable. Men and women share the task of providing for and producing their personal and their family health.

8. Women have the right to access opportunities to a uniquely appropriate and acceptable education so they can perform the task of providing/producing health successfully and develop their full potential to improve their social and economic status as productive women over and above their traditionally defined reproductive role.

9. Gender equality and equity are fundamental to the attainment of development, health, and well being. The key to the achievement of gender equality and equity is women’s liberation from subordinate and constricting roles in all her relations. A women’s empowerment is concretely expressed in terms of her full participation in all aspects of personal and community life. Corollary to this, a woman's decision must be supported at all times.

10. Women must be free from all forms of violence. Thus, society must guarantee her safety and protection.

11. Long-term sustainability of reproductive health program requires commitment from national and local government including non government organizations that builds on multi-sectoral participation/consultation in policy/program development and implementation.

12. Adequate financing as a medium for sustainability should ensure equity, safety and quality of service especially for marginalized women.

13. Health is a basic human right. Everyone has the right to the highest attainable standard of physical, social, and mental health. Reproductive and sexual health is the basic right of every man and woman and is an integral part of every stage of life, It is a component of overall lifelong health. Hence, reproductive health shall utilize a life span approach, as follows: 
i. Children: have the right to survive and develop their optimum capacity under the guidance and with the support of their parents, families, and society.
ii. Adolescents:
iii. Young adults
iv. Adults
v. Older persons: have the right to reproductive health services that will promote their well being.

14. Women have the right to enjoy the highest standard of health. A comprehensive women’s health service should be made available, affordable, and equitable to all women.

15. Reproductive health care should provide the widest range of services without any coercion. 

16. Woman—centered, culturally acceptable, and gender sensitive reproductive health services that ensure sexual and reproductive privacy and confidentiality should be provided.

17. Reproductive health should pay special attention to the adolescent and in particular the girl-child. They should be protected from all forms of violence and should be provided with factual information that will develop in them the level of maturity required to make responsible decisions.

18. Women’s social empowerment and economic security clearly contribute to and depend on good reproductive health.

19. Men’s participation in attaining sexual and reproductive health goals contributes to the social empowerment and economic security of women.

20. The right to health implies a right to reproductive health services that respect and promote clients’ rights, responds to their needs, and facilitates individual choice and consent on matters such as determining  the number and spacing of children and promoting satisfying and safe sex resulting in wanted and safe pregnancies. 

21. The provision reproductive health services should respect the various religions, ethical values, and cultural backgrounds of people.
