<subject>SUBJECT: Guidelines In the Prevention and Control of Malaria In Special Population Groups 
</subject>
<body>

I. Rationale: 

Malaria is not just a health problem but also a socio—economic concern that affects the well- being of people. It undermines the health and welfare of pregnantwomen, indigenous people, endangers the children’s survival and debilitates the rest of the population. 

Knowing the vulnerability of the disadvantaged and marginalized populations to the disease and its adverse consequences on their welfare and health, dictates that intervention measures must be primarily directed to these groups. 

Special population groups are possible sources of infection that may lead to reintroduction of malaria in low-endemic areas. These groups include the indigenous people, developmental project workers, displaced populations, forest workers, migrant workers/overseas contract workers, the military and paramilitary, pregnant mothers and children under-ﬁve years old. 

Based on DOH — IDO currentepidemiological records, 0—5 year old children account for about 22% of cases (17.4% in 2010 and 25% in 2011). Pregnant women are much less of a concern based on records although this might already be attributed to the special interventions aimed towards them. Various indigenous peoples group, however, continue to account for a statistically signiﬁcant percentage of cases particularly in Palawan, Sulu, Tawi-tawi,Zambalesand Occidental Mindoro where affectation not just of individuals is recorded but that of families. In addition, now more than ever, the correlation between means of livelihood and predisposition to the disease has been more ﬁrmly established. As the cases continue to be reduced, there now exists a better opportunity to actually look more closely into individual case reports and analyze the occurrence of cases based on the actual, entire line of epidemiological data available, allowing us to draw more concrete conclusions and developing more specific interventions. 

II. Objective: 

This Order shall set theguidelines in the management of malaria for special population groups to include the indigenous people, developmental project workers, overseas contract workers/migrant workers, local/foreign tourists, military and paramilitary, displaced populations, ' forest workers and pregnant women and children under 5 years old. 

 

II. Scope and Coverage 

These guidelines shall apply to all National Government Agencies (Environmental Management Bureau (EMB), Department of Labor and Employment (DOLE), Department of Transportation (DOT), Department of Foreign Affairs (DFA), National Commission of Indigenous Population, (NCIP), Bureau of Quarmtine (BOQ), Department of Social Welfare and Development (DSWD), Department of Energy and Natural Resources (DENR) and its Regional Offices, Local Govemment Units (LGUs), Public and Private health facilities, Non—Government Organizations @1605) whose ﬁmctions and activities contribute to the management of malaria for the special population groups. 

III. Deﬁnition of Terms 

1) Indigenous People (11’s) are people whose cultural characteristics including livelihood require them to constantly move from one area to another. These comprise the ethnic population who do not permanently settle in a speciﬁc locality (nomadic) or the non— mobile groups that usually inhabit the mountainous and hard-to—reach areas. They build makeshift and temporary houses with incomplete walls. They are possible sources of infection to places where they move in.

2) Military and PNP groups refer to members/ personnel of this branch of government who are mandated by the constitution to uphold and maintain the sovereignty and the internal security of the country and its peoples with special emphasis on those personnel or members who are permanently or intermittently assigned and reassigned for ﬁeld operations to and from malaria-endemic areas. 

3) Paramilitary is a group of civilians organized in a military fashion to operate in place of or assist regular army troops or a group of personnel with military structure functioning either as civilian force or in support of military forces. 

4) Migrant Workers/Overseas Filipino Workers (OFWs) refer to Filipino workers whose employment requires deployment to countries identiﬁed as malaria—endemic countries. These Filipino workers may either come for short vacation and return back or permanently stay in the country. 

5) Internally displaced populations refer to families and its members who are forcibly removed from their permanent residences as a result of war/armed conﬂict, military operations and occurrence of natural and man-made disasters and relocated in malaria endemic areas or adjacent to endemic areas. 


6) Sites of Development Projects refer to projects undertaken or implemented in a speciﬁc geographical location designed to uplift or upgrade the economic status of the area concerned whether directly or indirectly which may trigger movements of workers or inﬂux of migrant workers from non-endemic areas that would expose them to transmission of the disease or workers from malaria—endemic areas who might be the source of infection in the sites. These include all levels of the labor force of developmental projects located in malaria-endemic areas. Development projects may include housing or resort construction, factories, dams, road development projects, mining and other industries. 

7) Tourist Population refer to travelers (foreign and local) who travel to or from malaria-endennc tourist/travel destination. These are local people from non-endemic provinces/areas going to endemic provinces/areas and stay thereat for a day to two months. Foreign tourists are people coming from other countries that are either malaria-endemic or non—endemic and are going to endemic provinces/areas and intends to stay there for a day to two months. 

8) Forest workers are people who make their livelihood by gathering products such as rattan, wood or make charcoal from natural or forest plantations. They stay there for a week or extended periods of time exposing them to infective malaria vectors. 

IV. Implementing Guidelines 

A. General Guidelines 

Steps shall be taken to systematically review and analyze existing epidemiologic data to more accurately identify the relative risk per special population groups and prioritize accordingly. A more in-depth study shall be undertaken to accurately pinpoint the risk factors and the mechanism in which they affect disease transmission. From this, more speciﬁc intervention measures and practical applications shall be developed including strategies for their implementation. 

The scope of intervention shall cover the three basic objectives; increase access to diagnostic and treatment services, implement appropriate vector control measures and strategies and intensify social mobilization activities which shall improve working knowledge and understanding that result to prevention of malaria and improve health seeking behavior. ' 

In the process of implementing all interventions, respect for cultural and religious beliefs and all civil rights of each special group shall be accorded. Consultations and appropriate coordination with all national and local ofﬁces and all other stakeholders shall be undertaken to establish working and functional collaborations. 

The local health systems shall be the fulcrum for implementation using all existing structures such as the local health boards (LHB) and community health teams (CHT) and shall utilize all existing systems fer collaboration and the community shall be the most active partner as well as beneﬁciary for all services. 

Systems and strategies for the implementation of all service delivery shall be based on existing data and information generated. Prioritization of areas, people groups and activities shall be based on the system of stratiﬁcation during planning. 

Systems of monitoring and evaluation shall be developed including a system of recording and reporting which shall be based on existing structures and systems.
