<body>

I. RATIONALE 

In 2008, the Department of Health (DOH) issued Administrative Order (AO) No. 2008— 0022 otherwise known as the “Policies and Guidelines in the Collaborative Approach of TB and HIV Prevention and Control”. This was drafted and disseminated by the TB HIV Collaborative Committee formed through DOH- Department Personnel Order no. 2006- 1869. The A0 aimed at initiating measures to address the dual burden of tuberculosis (TB) and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and avert future scenario of a syndemic. Since then, various pilot initiatives were implemented by the National TuberculOsis Control Program (NTP), the National STI and AIDS Prevention and Control Program (NASPCP) and key private interest groups. 

Considering the increasing trend. of TB-HIV co-infection and the need to scale-up TB-HIV collaborative initiatives, a Joint Assessment and Planning for TB-HIV Collaboration was held in September 2012 among DO'H Program Managers, Center for Health DevelOpment- Metro Manila (CHD- Metro Manila), World Health Organization (WHO), donor agencies, civil society organizations, including peeple living with HIV, Local Government Units (LGU) and implementing facilities (Social Hygiene Clinics, DOTS Centers, HIV Treatment Hubs and PMDT treatment facilities). 

Anchored on the learning and insights from current TB-HIV initiatives in the country and the 2012 World Health Organization 12—point Agenda for TB—HIV Collaboration, 5th AIDS Medium Term Plan and 2010—2016 Philippine Plan of Action to Control Tuberculosis, new protocols have been adopted and concomitant changes to policies and guidelines are - imminent for scale-up and full implementation. This A0 is therefore, being released. 

II. OBJECTIVES 

This AO is issued. to update the policies and guidelines with the end in view of decreasing the burden of TB among People Living with HIV (PLHIV) and the burden of HIV among TB patients. 

Further, this issuance is geared to establish various mechanisms for collaboration between the NTP and NASPCP in identified areas for implementation, providing guidelines for cross-referral of TB to HIV and HIV to TB, define the roles and responsibilities of key stakeholders at all levels, and eventually strengthen Directly Observed Treatment Short Course (DOTS) services in the treatment hubs, Social Hygiene Clinics and HIV Testing and Counseling in the DOTS facilities. 

III. SCOPE/COVERAGE 

This Order shall apply to both public and private DOTS facilities; PMDT Treatment facilities, Social Hygiene Clinics and Treatment Hubs identiﬁed by the DOH to implement these guidelines. 

Provision of Provider Initiated HIV counseling and Testing among registered TB patients shall be implemented in HIV high prevalence areas (Category Sites A and B) and all PMDT treatment facilities while management of TB among PLHIV shall be implemented nationwide. 

IV. DEFINITION OF TERMS 

A. Client-initiated HIV testing and counseling (also called Voluntary Counseling and Testing, or VCT) - involves individuals actively seeking HIV testing and counseling at a facility that offers these services 

B. Provider-Initiated Counseling and Testing (PICT) - refers to HIV testing and counseling which is recommended by health care providers to persons attending health care facilities, as a standard component of medical care. 

C. DOTS Center — are all health centers nationwide and some hospitals, prisons, other government clinics, and private clinics that are providing TB serviCes (diagnosis through sputum examination, treatment and counseling). 

D. HIV Treatment Hub - a hospital facility providing prevention, treatment, care and support services to People Living with HIV (PLHIV) including but not limited to Voluntary HIV counseling and Testing (VCT), clinical management, patient monitoring and other care and support services. May also be a DOTS center. 

E. HIV Testing Centers - are facilities accredited by the Bureau of Health Facilities and Services (BHFS), capable of performing HIV testing by medical technologists that have undergone the training on HIV Testing Proﬁciency. 

F. Social Hygiene Clinic (SHC) - full-time Sexually Transmitted Infection (STI) clinics or part-time STI clinics integrated in Rural Health Units (RHUs) and City Health Ofﬁces (CHOs). 

G. HIV positive - a person with HIV infection as indicated by the presence of antibodies against HIV on a test of blood or tissue; synonymous with sero positive. 

H. TB/I-IIV Diagnostic Committee - is composed of the Chiefs of the HIV and DOTS Clinic, a Radiologist and other experts in the treatment hub who decide the management of difﬁcult cases of patients with TB-HIV co-infection based on the NTP and NASPCP policies and guidelines. 

I- STD/AIDS Cooperative Central Laboratory (SACCL) — is the DOH designated National Referral Laboratory for HIV and Sexually Transmitted Infections. It is operated by San Lazaro Hospital — Department of Health. 

J. Category A and B - are areas for prioritization based on the number of reported cases, HIV prevalence, Most At Risk Population (MARP) size, results of the Rapid Assessment of HIV vulnerability and presence of multiple risks as categorized by the National Epidemiology Center. 

K. GeneXpert — a rapid diagnostic tool/machine that provides TB test result less than 2 hours and can diagnose drug resistant TB withinthc same period.
