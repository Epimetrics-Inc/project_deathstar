<subject>SUBJECT: Implementing Guidelines on the "Patak Kontra Polio" in Autonomous Region for Muslim Mindanao (ARMM) and in High-Risk Areas</subject>

<body>
I. BACKGROUND and RATIONALE

The Philippines has been free of wild poliovirus for the past 12 years. The last indigenous wild poliovirus was isolated in Cebu last May 1993. Our country together with member countries of the Western Pacific Region (WPR) were certified as polio-free by an independent body, the Regional Certification Commission on Polio last October 2000 in Kyoto, Japan.

Sustaining and maintaining a polio-free status remains a challenge. Achieving a high population immunity (85% and above) against polio in all barangays, improve surveillance on Acute Flaccid Paralysis (AFP) and conduct of supplemental immunization activities (SIA) in targeted population are essential for polio eradication.

For the past 5 years, full immunization coverage among infants below 12 months never reached 95%, leaving an estimated half a million of children every year at risk of having any of the vaccine-preventable childhood illnesses. Likewise, low AFP surveillance, our geographic proximity to Indonesia, which as of morbidity week 31, has 205 cases of wild poliovirus cases, and the presence of port entries places the Philippines at risk of wild poliovirus importation. These significant findings prompted the Department of Health (DOH) to call for a SIA dubbed as "PATAK KONTRA POLIO" in selected identified areas nationwide.

This administrative order has been issued to guide all concerned health workers, and partners in the implementation of the campaign.

II. OBJECTIVES

A. General Objectives:

The campaign aims:

1) To increase population immunity against wild poliovirus to decrease the risk of imported wild poliovirus being transmitted into the Philippines

2) To consolidate the Polio Eradication Initiative in the Philippines during the post-certification stage up to the Global Certification

3) To protect children and mothers in high-risk areas against other vaccine-preventable diseases.

4) To develop a plan to ensure every child is reached in every barangay for immunization at least quarterly.

B. Specific Objectives

The door-to-door strategy adopted in the Philippines entails the movement of vaccination teams from door to door in urbanized areas and in strategically selected temporary fixed sites in rural barangays, streets, markets and other outdoor areas to:

1) Identify all children under 5 years of age
2) Vaccinate with one dose (two drop) of OPV all children identified for 2 rounds
3) Vaccinate all under-vaccinated children
4) Re-visit and vaccinate all absent eligible children

III. COVERAGE OF THE CAMPAIGN

The "Patak Kontra Polio" shall first be implemented regionwide in ARMM and all barangays in Zamboanga City on the following dates:

ROUND 1: August 29 - September 2, 2005
ROUND 2: September 26 - 30, 2005

IV. GENERAL GUIDELINES

A. Vaccination Strategies

1. Door-to-Door Vaccination

The strategy consists of door-to-door (OPV) immunization in urban, and poblacion; large numbers of unimmunized, or other locally determined reasons requiring door-to-door. Strategic temporary fixed sites in rural barangays, with meticulous micro planning and intensive supervision ensuring that all children from 0 to 59 months regardless of previous immunization status are reached in all selected areas.

Children in public areas such as streets, markets and parks, should also be targeted to ensure that all children are reached.

2. Polio Plus

To provide maximum protection to the children against the EPI diseases, other antigens and Vitamin A shall be provided. All under-immunized children under 12 months should receive BCG, unimmunized less than 24 months old should receive DPT; children between 9-59 months receive AMV to become fully vaccinated. Strongly consider vaccinating these children to 2 doses of AMV. Vitamin A for children ages 6 to 59 months shall also be given during the second round of PKP as part of Garantisadong Pambata, Round 2.

C. Organizational Management

The existing structures established in the conduct of mass immunizations shall be revitalized to provide directions, advice and recommendations to the successful implementation of the campaign.

The Secretary of Health shall be the over-all chairman with the National Immunization Committee (NIC) as the advisory body.

At the regional level/provincial/city/municipal levels, the head of office shall be the over-all responsible for the Operations.

D. Communication and Social Mobilization

Indonesia had a successful first immunization round. However, the second round was less successful. Community members attributed incidental deaths to the OPV. They identified the communication strategy as an area needing improvement. The Philippines has encountered similar situations, including the Tetanus Toxoid Controversy.

The success of this activity depends on the success of social mobilization activities. Social Mobilization before and during the campaign is essential because it (1) informs the target population about the importance of the campaign, the time & place immunization services will be offered; (2) informs the people who influence the target population such as the parents, informal opinion leaders, religious leaders, local chief executives, non-government organizations and special groups- nomadic groups, indigenous people and (3) clears up misconceptions about the campaign (4) Enables health workers and program planners to provide convenient services; to anticipate potential problems; and to arrive at viable solutions.

As in the previous mass vaccinations, multiple sectors and stakeholders will have to be mobilized. Provincial/City/Municipal and barangay level social mobilization activities are also expected to follow the same procedures and general pattern of networking. There are, however, many other innovations possible only at the community level. Below describes necessary steps.

Launchings, Ceremonial "Patak", sales conferences and orientations, press conference, local church announcements can be undertaken to inform the public about the campaign.

It is critical that religious and opinion leaders are advocates. This should take place through meetings with high-level leaders and subsequent meetings and orientations.

D. MOBILIZATION OF RESOURCES

These sections reiterate the functions of National/Regional (including DOH representatives), Provincial /City/Municipal Health Staff as well as the vaccination teams in the conduct of mass immunization campaigns such as this "Patak Kontra Polio" as follows:

1. Mobilize resources - human, financial, material, etc. - to ensure the successful implementation of the campaign. If necessary, they shall provide vaccinators teams from their own health staff. This shall also include full support for travel and communication of the vaccination and monitoring teams.

2. Prioritize vaccination efforts where unvaccinated children are likely to reside. Many implementers are placing undue energy to reach a few children who are most likely immunized while there are many more missed unvaccinated children who live in neighboring depressed and congested barangays.

3. Ensure that the field vaccination teams of the appropriate barangays utilize the list of children missed in school/day care center vaccinations as their guide when they do the community level vaccinations so that these children are vaccinated at home outside of school hours.

4. Coordinate more closely with pediatricians and other private practitioners so that they strongly encourage their clients to have their children vaccinated. Pediatricians may be allowed to vaccinate their own patients, if necessary.

5. Strengthen the command posts at all levels - region, province, city, municipality, barangay - by ensuring that they comply with all relevant guidelines and procedures and that they are fully provided with appropriate support systems and resources.

Other recommended activities and details to mobilize the provinces, cities, municipalities, barangays, communities and schools has been provided in the "Ligtas Tigdas Field Guide 2004" for details.

Information Dissemination:

IEC materials like posters, leaflets and streamers shall be posted in strategic areas. Leaflets with messages motivating the general public to have all children vaccinated shall be given to the parents. A streamer announcing the campaign shall be prominently displayed identified areas.

Information announcing and motivating mothers/child minders to bring their children for immunization shall be done by using the radio/TV/local newspaper, through the Church, through the local associations like PTA, schools and other agencies. This can be intensified during the 2 weeks preceding the date of the campaign.

Prototype promotional materials have been developed by the National Center for Health Promotion, Department of Health specific for the campaign to guide each LGUs. (Annex A Prototype Poster and Streamer)

V. IMPLEMENTING MECHANISMS

A. Pre-Patak Kontra Polio

A1. Perform Data Analysis

All planning should begin with data analysis. This will focus activities and resources to optimally reach every child. DPT3 unimmunized will be used as a proxy for the number of persons unimmunized against OPV because it is currently the most reliable data. Annex B Form 1 with the instructions shall be used specific for this activity.

A2. Determine Vaccine & Personnel Requirements

This activity will enable health workers to calculate vaccine needs for the SIA and number of staff needed.

A3. Develop a Detailed Community Map

Maps are critical to organize planning and visually show areas with unmet needs and how to reach all the infants and women in the area. Each LGU shall develop this map as follows:

• Obtain a detailed map of the area. These can usually be obtained from Urban Planning, municipal maps or other sources. Even a street map will suffice if it is large enough. For the purposes of this exercise, if a detailed map is unavailable now, draw an accurate map outlining your catchment areas.

• Demarcate on the map:^1

i. Boundaries of the catchment areas
ii. Health facilities and sites used for health purposes
iii. Roads
iv. Geographical Landmarks

• Subdivide and demarcate on the map boundaries of areas with distinguished populations (e.g., for a barangay: urban slums areas, elite subdivisions, or middle class communities, for a region: cities and provinces).

• Indicate the estimated eligible population and number of households in each demarcated area.

• Color Code the areas on the map distinguishing in red highlight all known high-risk areas that were identified in Table 1.

• Health centers use the map to identify sites for setting up strategic temporary fixed posts in all barangays where door-to-door strategy will not be used. If in a far flung barangay, indicate route and means of transportation.

A4. Meeting With The Community

The community plays a vital role in achieving high immunization. Health center staff should meet with the barangay captains, religious leaders and other influential leaders to discuss the objectives of the campaign, identify ways and means on how they are of help in reaching all the children/mothers. Follow-up the agreements set during the initial meeting to ensure the full support and commitment for the activity.

Specific roles of the community to ensure 95% OPV coverage at the different phases of the campaign are highly recommended as follows:

1 This map should be reviewed with local medical and non-medical staff to ensure underserved populations are included.

Before the campaign:

Health staff will arrange with the Barangay Captain to hold a community meeting. They should do the following (in order):

• Elicit community concerns, perceived barriers and benefits, convenient time and place for the immunization activities;
• Facilitate discussion around these points;
• Address issues that have not come up, e.g., purpose, benefits, safety of the vaccine, coincidental problems;
• Arrive at agreements of the community's roles in the activity, times and venues
• Organize family leaders^2 to ensure family fully vaccinated

During the campaign:

To ensure high coverage, family leaders will remind parents the night before going house to house about the immunization activity. During the activity, at the appropriate time, they will mobilize the families to get vaccinated. They will inform the vaccination teams at once of any missed children or mothers while the vaccination team is present.

A5. Develop A Microplan

Review previous worksheets. identify how each of the following will be carried out

• Ensuring sufficient vaccines available at the right time and place.
• Calculate other logistics needs using Table 4 for syringes/needles, safety collection box)
• Ensure cold chain maintained (cold room, refrigerators, freezers, carriers, etc.) If not completed within the year, complete the Cold Chain and Logistics Assessment Worksheet.
• Ensure Human Resources sufficient based on Table 2b. Consider if additional temporary manpower is required.

B. Actual Patak Kontra Polio

B1. Steps On The Conduct Of The Door-To-Door Vaccinations

B1.1 The Vaccination Team

The teams are composed of a vaccinator and a recorder. The teams will directly work with the family leaders. Vaccination teams must vaccinate all children under five they can find regardless of previous vaccination status, not only in households but also in the streets, markets, parks, everywhere.

2 A family leader is a community member who will represent the best interest of families within about 5-20 nearby households.

The vaccinator shall be the team leader and has the over-all supervision of the immunization activity in the assigned area. In areas with high under/unimmunized children or low immunization coverage, it is recommended that a midwife or a nurse shall be the vaccinator to provide the missed injectable vaccines. The vaccinator needs to organize and coordinate the vaccination site, the recorder and the family leaders for efficient crowd mobilization and control, flow of patients to ensure safe injection and disposal and information dissemination.

The recorder is responsible for filling up the form and document the team's progress and accomplishment. He or she is also responsible in making the child left's finger as well as marking of the house visited. The recorder will need to maintain the crowd control set up by the vaccinator and disseminate information on fever and reasons to seek help. The recorder will maintain the organization of the family leaders in terms of when to mobilize who and where.

"Master-listing" of children or any other type of nominal lists of children (such as "enumeration lists" or "defaulters lists") are no guarantee of completeness of coverage (all children) and should not be used as a "tool" for a high quality door-to-door immunization. There will almost always be some, and possibly many, target age children who are not included on these lists.

B1.2 Before starting the day's visit, each team should check the following:

• Coordinated with the barangay officials on the immunization sessions
• Information on the expected results for the day
• Route plan for the day, indicating houses, nursery schools and markets to be visited
• Expected areas family leaders to cover at which time.
• Expected number of houses, nursery schools and markets to be visited
• Expected number of children under 5 years old to be immunized
• Available supplies for the day's target

- A map (sketch) of the assigned area
- Oral polio vaccine with vaccine vial monitor (VVM) and droppers
- Other vaccines: BCG, DPT, MV, TT
- Vitamin A capsules (100,000 IU & 200,000 IU)
- Vaccine carrier: 1 per vaccination team, with 2 frozen icepacks
- Tally sheets: 1 for each day
- Chalk to mark the houses where immunization is completed
- Markers or pens to mark the children
- ECCD Cards

B1.3 Conducting The Visits Door To Door

a. Introduction on the Purpose of the Visit

On entering a house, the vaccinating team should:

• Introduce themselves as part of the "PATAK KONTRA POLIO" from the nearest health center.
• Briefly explain the purpose of the visit: To protect all children under five years of age against polio and other EPI diseases.
• Ask for all children under 5 years in the household to be presented to the team for vaccination.

b. Give the following vaccines:

<image>table_1.png</image>

Reminders for ensuring the quality of vaccines to be given to the children/mothers:

• It is important to keep the vaccine as cool as possible at all times. Open the vaccine carrier as little as possible, and keep the vaccine carrier in the shade if you can.

• The Vaccine Vial Monitor (VVM) indicates whether the vaccine can be used or not. Before giving vaccine, always check the VVM. If the VVM becomes as dark or darker in color than the indicator put it aside and DO NOT USE THE VACCINE.

c. Markings of a Vaccinated Infant/Child and Houses Visited:

• After giving vaccine, mark the nail and skin of the child's small left finger.

• Fill in the tally sheet - Vaccination Team Daily Accomplishment Report. Record all children immunized and count the house. Check the cell in form if the child was vaccinated in the household or in the street.

• For infants given first dose of any of the antigen, record in the ECCD card also.

• Place a circle (O) chalk mark on the house to identify it as 'completed' only if all children aged 0-59 months in it were vaccinated.

d. Markings On Closed Houses Or Missed Eligible Child/Children:

If the house is closed or the team doesn't immunize all of the 0-59 month old children

• For every missed child in the household, note down the name and address of the child at the back of the recording form. This record shall remind the vaccination team that a household needs to be revisited.

• Ask relatives or neighbours the most appropriate time to re-visit 'missed' house or children (should be in the end of the same day or next morning). At the end of the day, decide with your supervisor when to revisit these houses to finish the immunization.

• Place an (X) chalk mark on the house to indicate unvaccinated child/children and the house must be re-visited.

e. If there is a market, nursery school, hospital, factory or other building in the area or children in the street

• Inquire whether there are any 0-59 month old children and vaccinate them - the goal is to vaccinate all of the children wherever they are found

If the planned area is completed before the end of the day, the team should not stop but should continue immunizing in the next area.

f. At the end of the day the team should:

• Complete all the required information on the tally sheet, including number of vaccine vials returned, unused and partially used.
• Report to the supervisor and review the day's activities: Were targets met?
• Report on any difficulties encountered and children or houses missed
• Decide on the re-visit for the (X) marked houses: Need to be re-visited in the evening or in the morning?
• Plan the next day's activities in coordination with your supervisor.

Reminder:

Record the number of empty vaccine vials, partially used, or put aside because the WM changed on the tally sheet and turned in to the supervisor at the end of the day. Do not discard any vials of vaccine

B1.4 Injection Safety

Safe Injection:
- Is one with a potent vaccine is administered in the correct dose using the correct procedure at the correct site;
- Does not harm the recipient;
- Does not expose the provider to any avoidable risk; and
- Does not spread waste that is harmful to the community and health workers.

Unsafe injection practices put clients, health workers, and the community at risk of injection abscesses and blood-borne diseases.

Health workers should observe sterile procedures; guard against needle stick injuries; and place used syringes and needles into the designated safety boxes WITHOUT RECAPPING. Recapping of auto-destruct syringes should be avoided in order to prevent vaccinators from pricking themselves with used needles.

Always remember!

• Use one auto-disabled (AD) needle-syringe per child.
• Apply the appropriate injection technique
• Do not recap used needles
• Handle used needles carefully to avoid wounds caused by needles
• Dispose of used AD needles-syringes properly

a. Handling, Storage, Treatment & Collection of Empty Vaccine vials and other hazardous health care generated during the "Patak Kontra Polio"

In addition to the provisions on Injection Safety of the Guide to Ligtas Tigdas 2004, the following are procedures and guidelines in handling empty vials and other hazardous health care wastes.

• Empty vaccine vials and vials with residual liquid shall be stored in a leak proof container (e. g. hard container -plastic gallon) separate from the used needles and syringes from the other hazardous health care wastes.

• Empty vials shall be treated through chemical disinfections i.e. chlorine solutions or heating (boiling, solar disinfections) and other acceptable procedures. In areas where collection is not a problem, these stored wastes can be disposed off directly through concrete vault and other acceptable disposable methods.

The same procedures can be applied to other types of hazardous health care wastes generated during this activity.

• All waste shall be collected and transported into the designated disposal facility.

• Disposal may be through encapsulation and safe burial and shall be in accordance with the provisions of the DOI-I Health Care Waste Management Manual and Safety Injections of the Guide to Ligtas Tigdas 2004.

B1.5 Adverse Event Following Immunization (AEFI)

An adverse event following immunization or AEFI is a medical incident that happens after immunization that causes concern. Although the vaccines used in national immunization program are extremely safe and effective, adverse events can occur following vaccine administration. In addition to reactions to the vaccines themselves, the process of immunization is a potential source of adverse events.

All the vaccines given in the Expanded Program on Immunization (EPI) are safe and effective. However, just as no vaccine is perfectly effective, none is entirely without risk. Different children can react differently. Therefore, some adverse events following immunization (AEFI) may still happen.

The most common reactions are often mild, of short duration and are not due to the vaccine. They are often coincidental or an injection reaction such as anxiety over the pain caused by the injection.

Common minor reactions such as mild local reactions, fever, and other self-limiting systemic symptoms need not be reported. Therefore, it is important for health workers to advise the parent/caregiver at the time of immunization that these reactions are expected, and advise them how to manage these common minor reactions at home.

Health worker (physician/ nurse/midwife/ hospital stafD/concerned citizen/parent/teacher) reports to the Municipal/City/Provincial level any AEFI within 24-48 hours through the fastest available means. (Telephone, fax cell phone, text messages, etc.

A flow of the AEFI Report has been diagrammed in the "Guide to Ligtas Tigdas". The same flow of report shall be followed.

B1.6 Recording and Reporting

There are reporting forms that are to be used during this campaign and examples of each form are annexed to this guide. They are used and completed as follows:

Reporting Form A - Vaccination Team's Daily Accomplishment

This is a daily accomplishment form to be filled up by each vaccination team, specifically the recorder.

This records each child vaccinated with OPV in the household or street. This form consists of the following:

a) Table which represents the number of households visited by the vaccination team. Each cell corresponds to one household. Tick (/) each cell per vaccinated child if all eligible children in the household were vaccinated. Marked (X) if there were eligible children in the household that were missed. Missed children should be scheduled revisit. Write the addresses at the back of the form for houses that need to be revisited.

Write the total number of household visited at the box provided for in the form at the end of the vaccination day.

b) Tables that consists of cells on OPV coverage at the streets.

Same steps and procedures above are followed in filling up the cells as well as the total number of children given OPV.

c) A table on Logistics Daily Summary is the daily inventory of OPV.

Fill up the corresponding boxes on:

d.1 Total number of OPV received during the day,
d.2 Total number of OPV spoiled
d.3 Total number of OPV returned empty
d.4 Total number of OPV returned unopened

Submit this form to the team supervisor at the end of every immunization day. Total for each vaccination team will be consolidated by the RHU or CHO using the Reporting Form B.

Reporting Form B1: Consolidated OPV Accomplishment Reports

This is a daily summary of OPV vaccination accomplishment to be filled up by each team supervisor. All spaces and columns should be filled up and the completed form should be submitted to the next higher level.

Reporting Form B2: Consolidated Polio Plus Accomplishment Reports

This is a daily summary of Polio Plus vaccination accomplishment to be filled up by each team supervisor. All spaces and columns should be filled up and the completed form should be submitted to the next higher level.

The following shall be the schedule of submission of the accomplishment reports.

<image>table_2.png</image>

C. Post-Patak Kontra Polio

C.1 Monitoring & Supervision

i. Composition

National, regional, provincial, city and municipal vaccination supervisors (if any) will be designated. It is recommended but is not limited to that the team supervisors are physicians and nurses.

The number of team supervisors should be as follows:

Urban Areas - At least 1 supervisor for 8 teams
Rural Areas - At least 1 supervisor for 4 teams

ii. Roles of the Supervisors/Monitors.

Before the Campaign:

• Ensures the timely and adequate transport of supplies and staff to support all the necessary campaign activities is made available
• Assists in the training of health workers and volunteers in all aspects of the campaign
• Coordinates for additional vaccinators and volunteers
• Coordinates with various partners in the campaign
• Visit the community leaders e. g. the Barangay Captain, Kagawad or religious leader, schools and day care centers together with the team and orient them about the forthcoming activity
• Coordinate with nearest hospital facility for possible referral of any AEFI
• Identify hospital medical staff to manage serious AEFI

During the Campaign:

• Assures that the vaccination teams are moving from one house to the next, vaccinating children, giving Vitamin A, marking the vaccinated child, and marking the house and proper recording using Reporting Forms.
• Provides special support to areas with lack of vaccination teams and supervisors
• Discusses with the teams issues/concerns and lessons learned, particularly how to handle revisits
• Reports daily accomplishment, issues/concerns and lessons learned to the CHO/MHO level
• Collects the filled-up safety boxes from the vaccination teams and stores it in a safe place prior to pick up by the sanitary inspector for proper disposal
• Monitors the safe collection and disposal of used syringes and needles
• Assists in the referral of emergency cases and investigation of adverse events
• Estimates and provides logistics to the vaccination teams
• Supervises, monitors and assist the vaccination teams including the teams from the fixed sites
• Accomplish and submit line list of AEFI to the City/Municipal Coordinator (Refer to Guide to Ligtas Tigdas 2004)

Immediate feedback to the persons supervised and the next higher levels of supervisors are important especially if there were problems found during the visits. The supervisor should know whom, when and how to call different persons involved so that immediate solutions to address the problem can be made using the fastest means. The use of mobile phones in the reporting of problems/issues before, during and after the campaign has proven to be advantageous resulting to immediate action as experienced in the past Polio Patak Campaign.

2. Rapid Coverage Assessment

The RCA shall be adopted to validate each child/mother were vaccinated.

Specifically this shall:

a. Compare assessment coverage with reported accomplishment;
b. Identify areas where there are missed children and
c. Take immediate actions to vaccinate missed children.

The duly designated and trained regional, provincial or city monitoring teams shall perform the validation procedures.

Validation shall be done at least once in all barangays in the cities, town proper and well-populated communities. In municipalities, all barangays in the poblacion and at least 2 barangays with highest and low accomplishment report must be covered.

Validation is usually barangay-wide, but can be done by sitio or by purok in big barangays.

At least one repeat validation shall be done in all areas that are found to have less than 95% coverage by the validation method.

The following shall be the procedure of validation:

1. Plan the validation. Assign validation/monitoring teams and schedule the validation based on the schedule of completion of vaccination in the barangay. Do not validate in areas that have not been fully covered by the vaccination teams.

2. Look at the Accomplishment Report of the City/Municipality/Barangay. Select areas with high and low reported OPV/measles immunization coverage for your sample. Ask for identified high risk areas especially populated/densely-populated areas.

3. Using the barangay spot map, identify four validation sites in each barangay to be validated: two (2) sites remote from general access (e.g. borders with other barangays, riverside, houses away from main roads) and two (2) central sites (e. g. slum areas around the market or railroad, houses along the main road or rail. Select all sites away from the health center.

4. Go to the selected sites one at a time and fill up the attached validation form (Rapid Assessment of Immunization Coverage using the Grab Sample and Door Sample Techniques).

Grab Sample: Grab at least 5 eligible children (0 to 59 months old) who are found in the streets in each selected sites. Determine their vaccination status by looking at their fingers and at their vaccination site. (The importance of immediate 1-2 days after validation is to ensure that at least the vaccination puncture is still visible). Make sure that there are 20 children in the grab sample.

Door Sample: Identify 5 doors (e.g. house, condominium, school, etc.) nearest to the selected site. If there is a variety, select at least two (2) doors of the hardest to reach doors (e.g. top floor or ones with complicated entry. Determine if the marking on the door correctly matches with vaccination status of all the children in the selected doors. Make sure that 20 doors are seen in sample sites.

5. Based on the summary of findings at the bottom of the validation form, determine the appropriate action for the barangay.

Action to be taken:

Findings A: If the findings show that all grabbed children have been vaccinated and that all doors are correctly labeled but there were still doors marked "X", the validation/monitoring team shall remind the vaccination team to revisit the "X" door immediately to vaccinate the missed children.

The validation/monitoring team shall also revisit these "X" doors to ensure that circles have been placed around the "X", corresponding to completion of vaccination of previously missed children. If the validation/monitoring team brought OPV/measles vaccines and other antigen/Vitamin A with them, they may instead vaccinate the missed children themselves, encircle the "X" on the door and submit the vaccination report to the appropriate vaccination team.

Findings B: If the findings show that there is at least one unmarked door or a door marked with a circle but with an unvaccinated eligible child, this means that, most probably, there are many more missed children in the area. The validation/monitoring team shall correct the labels on the doors (mark the doors "X") and immediately - the same day, if possible - discuss their findings with the appropriate vaccination team to elicit their commitment to revisit the barangay and do a door-to-door search for, and vaccinate, other children who might have been missed, and ensure 100% coverage.

As above, if the validation/monitoring team brought OPV/measles vaccines and other antigens/Vitamin A with them, they may also vaccinate the missed children themselves, appropriately marked the doors and submit the vaccination report to the appropriate vaccination team. The door-to-door search for additional missed children should still be conducted even if these missed children have already been vaccinated by the validation/monitoring teams.

The validation/monitoring team shall follow-up to check that the door-to-door search is actually conducted. They shall also, as much as possible, repeat the validation in these areas.

Continue the cycle of "vaccination - validation - search for missed children - vaccination" until there is not a single missed eligible child in any city, town proper or well-populated community.

3. Evaluation

A consultative meeting /workshop shall be conducted within 2 weeks after the province or city has declared completed immunization and validation has been completed for each round. It will provide an opportunity for replenishing or redistributing vaccines and other logistics where needed. It will serve as a forum for data analysis and planning for the next round and to improve routinely reaching these populations and improve surveillance.

VI. Repealing Clause

Any existing provision or issuance found inconsistent with this order should be repealed.

VII. Effectivity

This order shall take effect immediately.
