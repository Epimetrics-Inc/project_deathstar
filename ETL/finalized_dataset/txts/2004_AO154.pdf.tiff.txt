<body>
I. RATIONALE

The Second National TB Prevalence Survey (1996-1997) shows that the private sector in the country manages a significant number of TB cases, but with relatively weak capacity for case holding. TB symptomatics and diagnosed TB cases would initially consult private physicians and some would eventually avail of their services. The Philippines has a large number of private providers (both for-profit and non-profit) and a large private health resource pool nationwide that are utilized even by low-income groups.,With the implementation and expansion of the DOTS strategy nationwide and the adoption of the Manual of Procedures 2001 by the DOTS impiementers in the public sector, the time is right for the participation of partners in the private sector to be harnessed into the program. This is of prime importance because the global and national target of 70% case detection rate cannot be achieved without contributions from the private sector.

With regard the National TB Program (NTP), its strong ally in the private sector is the Philippine Coalition Against Tuberculosis or PhilCAT. Since the creation of PhilCAT in 1994, the group has been in active partnership with the Department of Health. Together with at least 50 other government and non-government organizations, associations and cause-oriented groups that are members of the coalition, the Department and PhilCAT have been jointly addressing issues that have beset TB control efforts in the country. The dynamic interaction between the public and private sectors epitomizes a Public-Private Mix.

The Philippine Health insurance Corporation or PhilHealth is a tax-exempt government corporation organized by virtue of Republic Act No. 7875, and otherwise known as the National Health Insurance Act of 1995. In 2003, PhilHealth issued PhilHealth Circular No. 17, Accreditation of DOTS Facilities which extended access of DOTS services from its members to their dependents.

This has the potential to increase DOTS implementation especially in the private sector. This was followed by PhilHealth Circular No.19, PhilHealth Outpatient TB-DOTS Benefit Package, which provided its members and beneficiaries quality DOTS services through certified and accredited DOTS facilities. Both circulars serve as sustaining mechanisms to widen DOTS coverage in the private sector, and to improve the quality of DOTS implementation in the public side.

The Public-Private Mix DOTS (or PPMD) is a strategy that is designed to increase case detection and synchronize the management of TB by various TB care providers. It is composed of a series of steps that are undertaken to establish a functional PPMD unit, either initiated by the government or by the private sector. The bottom line is that NTP-DOTS should be implemented in consonance with approved operational policies, standards and technical guidelines. The DOH endorses the PPMD strategy so that this harmony and complementation of TB services amongst public and private sectors in the country can improve the coverage and quality of DOTS.

With the adoption of the PPMD, all NTP projects and groups (e.g., Global Fund for AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria and PhilTIPS) shall coordinate with the DOH, PhilCAT and other leaders in TB control through the National Coordinating Committee on PPMD (NCC on PPMD). The NCC on PPMD is hereby created, and it is composed of the Department of Health, PhilCAT, PhilHealth and PPMD Technical Groups. The coordinating committee's main function is to orchestrate the implementation of the PPMD strategy across the country. Likewise, a Regional Coordinating Committee on PPMD (RCC on PPMD) in the different regions shall be established.

II. OBJECTIVES

A. General

To improve the effectiveness and sustain mechanisms of public-private partnership in support of the implementation of DOTS program by all implementing partners, thereby improving services especially for the poor and the disadvantaged sector in the country.

B. Specific

1. To institutionalize a mechanism for organizing health services using resource players to: I) collaborate and join treatment protocols in treating and managing TB, ii) implement DOTS in private clinics/hospitals through the assistance of PhilCAT and other partners.

2. To unify and coordinate efforts of the Department of Health and other partners to improve the quality of DOTS program implementation in the Philippines.

SCOPE AND COVERAGE

The purpose of the creation of NCC on PPMD is to provide a forum for the discussion and resolution of issues concerning PPMD implementation. The NCC on PPMD and RCC-PPMD shall serve as the overall coordinating body at the national and regional levels respectively. Their decisions shall apply to the various PPMD Projects and PPMD units including all PPMD and PPMD-related activities under the NTP.

IV. GENERAL POLICIES

A. The DOH shall retain its role as the lead agency in the implementation of the TB-DOTS Program. It shall provide policy direction in terms of:

1. formulation of programs, policies and priorities for NTP-DOTS
2. utilization of research results in the formulation of policies for TB-DOTS program
3. system performance and monitoring and evaluation
4. capacity building

B. Public-Private Mix DOTS (PPMD) as a strategy of the National TB Program of the DOH shall be established. The NCC on PPMD and the RCC on PPMD shall serve and function as permanent committees and shall exist as long as PPMD is a national strategy. The selection of Local and International TB Partners as Technical Advisers shall be the discretion of the NCC on PPMD.

C. The DOH shall continue to identify and define areas for building strong partnerships and networking with various stakeholder in the health sector in the provision of health services
