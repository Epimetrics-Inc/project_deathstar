<body>
I. RATIONALE

Cancers ﬁgure among the leading causes of morbidity and mortality worldwide,with approximately 14 million new cases and 8.2 million cancer related deaths in 2012 (WHO). It is expected that annual cancer cases will rise (from 14 million in 2012 to 22 million within the next 2 decades and over 200,000 children will be affected yearly (WHO). Every year cancer drains an estimated $2 trillion from the world economy in terms of lost output and the cost of treatment, equivalent to around 1.5% of global GDP, as well as wreaking terrible suffering on millions of individuals, families and communities (World Economic Forum 2014). In a recent study conducted by The George Institute for Global Health, University of Sydney, a study of new cancer patients in the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) region called the Asean CosTs In ONcology (ACTION) showed that a cancer diagnosis in Southeast Asia is disastrous, even within only 12 months, for over 75% of new patients. The ACTION Study adds compelling evidence to the argument for policies that improve access to care and provide adequate ﬁnancial protection from the costs of cancer.

Cancer is still the third leading cause of morbidity and mortality in the country after diseases of the heart and the vascular system (Philippine Health Statistics 2011). In the WHO Globocan 2012: Estimated Cancer Incidence, Mortality and Prevalence Worldwide in 2012 report, the estimated incidence of cancer in the Philippines for bOth men and women (excluding melanoma skin cancer) reached more than 43,000 and will increase by 64% within 5 years. About 3,500 new cases of cancer will be diagnosed in children every year -— the equivalent of almost 10 children every day (Philippine Children’s Medical Center).

A recent assessment revealed shortcomings in the Philippine Cancer Control Program (PCCP) which began in 1990 and urgent recommendations were made toreverse the ‘cancer epidemic”. Hence, there is an urgent need to revise and strengthen the Administrative Order No. 89—A s. 1990 to ﬁll in the gaps and to further improve the PCCP which shall be known now as the Philippine Cancer Prevention and Control Program.

 

II.OBJECTIVES

A. General

This order is aimed to set overall policy directions and identify the roles and functions of DOH, its ofﬁces and partner agencies in reducing the impact of cancer and improve the well-being of Filipino people with cancer and their families by providing holistic services from cancer prevention, screening, diagnosis, palliative care and treatment, until recovery and end-of—life or hospice care.


III. Specific


1)To operationalize the National Cancer Registry and Surveillance System

2)To reduce mortality and improve overall survival and quality of life of people with various cancer types through early diagnosis and prompt treatment;

3)To reduce the incidence of prioritized cancers associated with the most common avoidable risk factors;

4)To ensure that prioritized cancer control services are provided in an equitable and sustainable way at all levels of care;

5)To increase and expand the coverage of cancer treatment, including but not limited to the use of innovative drugs and psychosocial support in the preventive, treatment, and survivorship stage of the patient and family, if necessary;

6)To set regulatory and accreditation standards for cancer institute / center, as an integral part of DOH and government hospitals including private hospitals as applicable, that follows a multi—disciplinary and interdisciplinary team approach to cancer management; and

7)To develop and update regularly a compendium of guidelines or standards for prioritized cancers including childhood cancer


III. SCOPE

This issuance shall apply to all stakeholders of cancer control — bureaus, national centers, services and attached agencies of the Department of Health and other key government agencies; local government units (LGUs); government-owned and - controlled corporations (GOCCs); health professionals and other health care providers, both public and private; anti-cancer health product providers; professional organizations and societies, civil society organizations (CSOs); non- government organizations (N GOs), research and development partners; academe; patients and patients’ groups.

 

 

IV. KEY DEFINITIONS

A. Cancer is a generic term for a large group of diseases that can affect any part of the body. Other terms used are malignant tumors and neoplasms. One deﬁning feature of cancer is the rapid creation of abnormal cells that grow beyond their usual boundaries, and which can then invade adjoining parts of the body and spread to other organs, the latter process is referred to as metastasizing. Metastases are the major cause of death from cancer. (WHO February 2015)

B. Cancer Control aims to reduce the incidence, morbidity and mortality of cancer and to improve the quality of life of cancer patients in a deﬁned population, through the systemic implementation of evidence-based interventions for prevention, early detection, diagnosis, treatment, and palliative care. (WHO Cancer Control Knowledge Into Action 2008)

C. Cancer Diagnosis comprises the various techniques and procedures used to detect or conﬁrm the presence of cancer. Diagnosis typically involves evaluation of the patient’s history, clinical examinations, review of laboratory test results and radiological data, and microscopic examination of tissue samples obtained by biopsy or ﬁne-needle aspiration. (WHO Cancer Control Knowledge Into Action 2008)

D. Cancer Prevention refers to measures and interventions that will decrease the likelihood or risk of an individual of acquiring cancer.

E. Cancer Survivorship starts at the time of disease diagnosis and continues throughout the rest of the patient‘s life. Family caregivers and friends are also considered survivors. It has three distinct phases: living through, with and beyond cancer. (MD Anderson Cancer Center)

F. Cancer Treatment is the series of interventions, including psychosocial and nutritional support, surgery, radiotherapy, chemotherapy and hormone therapy, that is aimed at curing the disease or prolonging the patient’s life considerably (for several years) while improving the patient’s quality of life. (WHO Cancer Control Knowledge Into Action 2008) Some people with cancer will have only one treatment. But most people have a combination of treatments, such as surgery with chemotherapy and/or radiation therapy. Patients may also have immunotherapy, targeted therapy, or hormone therapy.

G. Hospice care is end-of—life care provided by health professionals and volunteers. They give medical, psychological and spiritual support. The goal of the care is to help people who are dying to have peace, comfort and dignity.

H. Interdisciplinary refers to integrating knowledge and methods from different disciplines, using a real synthesis of approaches, e.g. oncologist — nurse — social worker ~ caregiver. Multidisciplinary refers to people from different disciplines working together, each drawing on their disciplinary knowledge, e. g. oncologist — surgeon — radiologist. The cancer care team may include not only the surgeon, radiation oncologists, and medical oncologists but also the expert in diagnostic imaging, the pathologist, the genetic counselor, the oncology nurse, the physical therapist, the hospital pharmacist, and others. Well-coordinated multi— and interdisciplinary care is the current standard, where patients can obtain consults and see specialists who all practice in one central location.

I. Palliative Care is treatment to relieve, rather than cure, symptoms caused by cancer. It can help people live more comfortably. Relief from physical, psychosocial and spiritual problems can be achieved in over 90% of advanced cancer patients through palliative care. (WHO February 2015)

J. Patient Navigation refers to individualized assistance offered to patients, families, and caregivers to help overcome health care system barriers and facilitate timely access to quality medical and psychosocial care. Cancer patient navigation works with a patient from pro-diagnosis through all phases of the cancer experience.

K. Premature Mortality refers to deaths that occur before a person reaches the average life expectancy as speciﬁed by Phil. Stat Authority (68.5 as of 2013).
