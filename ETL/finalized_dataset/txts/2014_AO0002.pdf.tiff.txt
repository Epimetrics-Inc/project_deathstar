<body>
 

I. RATIONALE 

The ﬁrst global study on premature deaths in 2009 (WHO Report) revealed that road crashes, suicide and violence were among the main causes of death worldwide for people aged 10 to 24 years. In 2011 (WHO Report), injuries were reported to be responsible for 9% of all deaths with road trafﬁc injuries claiming nearly 3,500 lives each day, making it among the 10 leading causes of mortality globally. In response to the foregoing, WHO called upon Member States to develop measures to prevent road trafﬁc injuries and violence. WHO recommended that such policies, strategies and plans of action be concrete and contain objectives, priorities, I timetables and mechanisms for evaluation. 

In the Western Paciﬁc, WHO called on its Member States to take ﬁrmer action to reduce the region's more than 600 suicides per day. At the September 2011 Fifth Milestones in a Global Campaign for Violence Prevention (GCVP) Meeting in South Africa, the Violence Prevention Alliance (VPA) developed the plan of action geared towards increasing the priority of evidence- informed violence prevention, building the foundations for violence prevention, and implementing violence prevention strategies. Likewise, the United Nations General Assembly adopted Resolution 64/255 proclaiming 2011—2020 to be a Decade of Action for Road Safety to stabilize and reduce global road traffic fatalities by 2020. 

The Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study conducted in 2010 showed that interpersonal violence, road injury, drowning, and self-harm (suicide) ranked sixth, 11th, 17th, and 27th, respectively, on the leading causes of premature deaths in the Philippines. Accidents are the fifth leading cause of mortality for the period of 2005-2010 as reported in the Philippine Health Statistics of the National Epidemiology Center. The Online National Electronic Injury Surveillance System (ONEISS) Fact Sheet for 2010—2012 revealed that transport or vehicular crash was the leading cause of unintentional injuries and interpersonal violence (mauling/assault, contact with sharp objects, and gunshot) was the leading cause of intentional injuries. 

 
In the ﬁrst quarter of 2013, the Essential Non-Communicable Disease Division (ENCDD), together with the Development Academy of the Philippines (DAP), developed the 5- year Strategic Plan for 2013—2017. One of the major recommendations from the stakeholders during the review of Violence and Injury Prevention Program (VIPP) was the revision of Administrative Order No. 2007-0010 or the “National Policy on Violence and Injury Prevention Program”. It was noted that there was no clear-cut action framework for the program and the creation of alliance of all the stakeholders of violence and injury prevention was not given attention. 

With the increasing mortality, morbidity, and disability due to violence and injury, there is a need to complement and enhance the existing policy on Violence and Injury Prevention in order to rise to the challenge of addressing this rapidly growing public health concern. It is also imperative to develop an action framework that serves as the strategic road map toWards prevention of violence and injuries. This new issuance shall serve as the overarching Administrative Order of different policies concerning violence and injuries and shall include the service delivery mechanism and the well-defined roles and responsibilities of the Department of Health and other major players. 

II. DECLARATION OF POLICIES

The National Objectives for Health (NOH) 2011-2016 aims to reduce morbidity and mortality from accidents and injuries.
