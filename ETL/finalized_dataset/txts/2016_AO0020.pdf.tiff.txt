Moreover, the Philippine Society for Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition states that the rate of malnutrition 1n Philippine hospitals 1s 35 to 50 %. This malnutrition rates are in fact reﬂective of undernutrition 

An analysis of the one-week cycle menu presented by ﬁve (5) LGU Hospitals and ten (10) DOH Hospitals in Visayas and Mindanao regions revealed that only 59% of the 1,800 kilocalorie daily allowance 13 met while for the macronutrient intake, carbohydrates 1s met at ' 63%, "protein at 70% and fats at 53% with the mean daily cost of the diet; at Php 74.39 per patient- The cost of meal rangedfrom Php 45.20 to Php 61.68/ patient meal /. day in LGU— funded level 1 to 3 hospitals, while 1n DOH- funded Medical Centers and Regional Hospitals _ y 1 . the range was Php 61.63 to Php 68. 79.
