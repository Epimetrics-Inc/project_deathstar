<subject>SUBJECT : Implementing Guidelines For The Provision 0f Assistance In The Upgrading Of Devolved Local Health Hospitals And Rural Health Units Based On Sentrong Sigla Standards, PHIC Accreditation and DOH Licensing Standards.</subject>

<body>

A. RATIONALE/ BACKGROUND:

With the devolution of health care services to the Local Government Units, fragmentation of local health services resulted to the deterioration of integrated approaches to health care delivery, efﬁciency of the health care delivery system and quality of local health care services. Referral systems among health facilities, and physical structures needing repairs and replacements, continued to be unattended which created a big backlog in capital outlay for local health facilities. As a result, many of the local health facilities were downgraded to primary health facilities causing tertiary hospitals to be overburdened with primary and secondary case, which could have been managed by lower health facilities (i.e., district hospitals, rural health units and barangay health stations).

To institutionalize local health systems within the context of locai autonomy, there is a need to provide for the upgrading of basic health facilities including hospitals, rural health units and barangay health stations with the aim of strengthening the delivery of primary health services and improving the referral systems.

B. PURPOSE:

This order is therefore issued to prescribe standard operating procedures for the identiﬁcation, selection and prioritization of assistance that will be provided by the Department of Health (DOH) through the Center for Health Development (CHD) to help and support the local government units achieved the required standards of their health facilities.
