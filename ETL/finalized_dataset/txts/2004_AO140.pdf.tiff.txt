<subject>SUBJECT: Revised Guidelines for Hospital-Based TB Control Program Under the Hosuitals as Centers of Wellness Program</subject>


<body>

I. RATIONALE

A signiﬁcant proportion of TB cases seek assistance from the hospitals. The ﬁrst National Tuberculosis (TB) Prevalence Study conducted in 1981—1983 showed that 23% of TB symptomatic visit the hospitals while the National Prevalence Survey conducted in l997-stated that only approximately half of the TB symptomatic interviewed took action. Of these, 47.9% self—medicated and only 12.8% availed of the services of the government health centers, which serve as the entry point to the program. Data gathered by the National Center for Health Facilities DeveIOpment of DOH also in 1997 revealed that TB ranks as the number two cause of death, fifth as the reason for discharges and seventh as cause of consultations among DOH—retained hospitals. Results from these initiatives imply the important role of hOSpitals in the identiﬁcation and management of TB cases. Further, increasing 1:: ase detection and c ure r ates through h ospital referrals would be a good strategy to achieve targets in treating tuberculosis.

In this regard, the Infectious Disease Ofﬁce (IDO) of the National Center for Disease Prevention and Control (NCDPC) has coordinated with the Hospitals as Centers of Wellness Program (HCWP) and initiated the process of systematizing and strengthening the services to be provided among TB symptomatics and TB patients.

This is being pursued to include the Directly Observed Treatment Short Course Chemotherapy for TB (DOTS) as the main strategy in treating TB cases in all DOH-retained and LGU Heapitals. Thisstrategy has proven to have dramatically improved the cure rate of TB patients to more than 85 per cent in areas where it has been implemented. Therefore, LGU hospitals and D OH- retained hospitals have to adopt the provisions of this revised Administrative Order

II. DEFINITION OF TERMS

1. DOH Retained Hospital — heapital under the direct supervision of DOH.

2. TB Symptomatic — a person manifesting cough for two weeks or more or combination of one or more of the following signs and symptoms like fever, progressive weight loss, hemoptysis or recurrent blood streaked sputum, chest and/or back pains not referable to musculo-skeletal disorder and others (tiredness, loss 0 f appetite, night s weats). T his p erson is n ot yet diagnosed as suffering from TB.

3. TB Patient — a person diagnosed as one suffering from TB based on laboratory (sputum examination for AFB, radiological ﬁndings suggestive of TB) and/or histologic examination.

4. Pulmonary Smear Positive Patient — a person whose sputum microscopy examination exhibits the tubercle bacilli.

5. Pulmonary Smear Negative Patient -- a person whose sputum microscopy examination exhibits no tubercle bacilli but with radiological ﬁndings suggestive of TB.

6. Extra—Pulmonary Patient — a person with tuberculous lesions in areas other than the lungs.

7. New TB Case - smear (+) and/or chest x—ray (+) who had never been treated for TB or one who had received anti-TB drugs for less than one month.

8. National Tuberculosis Control Program (NTP) ID Card —- This is a card
given to a case as a handy source of information on the patient’s diagnosis,
treatment regimen, schedule of drug-taking and follow-up sputum smear
examinations.

9. NTP Treatment Card - This card is a record of TB patient admitted to the treatment program. It is completely filled out with all the necessary information about the TB patient and the treatment he/she is receiving including drug intake and collection as well as the results of sputum follow—up examinations. This is maintained and updated by a staff concerned at the DOTS clinic.

III. COVERAGE AND SCOPE

These guidelines shall apply to all DOH—retained hospitals and LGU hospitals that will implement the hospital-based DOTS under HCWP.

IV. GENERAL GUIDELINES

DOTS shall continue to be the main strategy for the NTP since it was adopted in 1993 during the external review of the program. This strategy comprises five components/essential elements and these are the following:

- Quality Microscopy - to conﬁrm whether or not TB bacilli are present in the sputum

- Uninterrupted Drug Supply — the right drugs must always be available at all times

- Reporting Books - as part of a system that document the progress in the treatment of patients

- Observer/Treatment Partner — individual who is either an NTP DOTS clinic member or patient’s family member or relative who will watch and monitor patients take in/swallow their drugs

- Political commitment - funding and sound policies need to support a well-managed DOTS Program may come from the government and private sector

B. Management of TB Patients in the Hospital

1. On Prevention

In accordance with the policies and procedures of the EPI, BCG vaccination shall be given to all newborn delivered in the hospital except those who are sick. Sick newborns maybe vaccinated just before discharge. The vaccination shall be administered by the Department of Pediatrics of each hospital.

Recording and reporting of this activity shall be done as prescribed by the EPI.

2. On Case Finding

2.1. All persons, whether seen at OPD or ward, with cough of two weeks or more or associated with any of the following signs and symptoms shall be suspected as having tuberculosis:

a. Fever

2.3. TB symptomatic with three Sputum negative results and who wish to avail of free x—ray examination shall be referred to the TB Clinic for further assessment before referring them for chest x-ray examination.

2.4. For those walk—in and in—patients (non-TB) with concomitant x-ray ﬁndings suggestive of Pulmonary Tuberculosis, a sputum examination is required prior to enrolment in the NTP. Likewise, for patients with extra—pulmonary tuberculosis, ofﬁcial pathologic report, chest x-ray and/or other diagnostic procedures shall be submitted to the hospital DOTS clinic staff concerned as soon as possible.

3. On Case Holding and Treatment

3.1. All diagnosed TB cases shall be referred to the TB clinic for pre-treatment assessment and evaluation. The cases shall be treated based on the following treatment regimens below:

<image>table_1.png</image>

3.2. TB patients who are confined at the hospital shall also be referred to the TB clinic. Referring physician from various departments should accomplish the referral slip and provide results of the laboratory examination relative to TB for proper assessment of the patient. Daily drug intake of patient shall be supervised. The nurse assigned in the ward shall record this in the treatment card. Treatment card shall be sent to the treatment unit where the patient shall continue his/her treatment based on the referral slip.

3.3. TB patients who are for discharge, whether from the ward or from the OPD shall be referred to the DOTS Clinic for enrollment in the NTP—TB Case Registry. Discharge summary, referral slip and photocopy of laboratory results shall be given to the NTP Coordinator. They may also be enrolled for treatment, provided the following requirements are satisﬁed:

a. the patient agrees with the treatment policies and strategies,
b. there is enough anti-TB drugs for the entire duration of the treatment,
c. there is adequate and trained manpower to provide the necessary case holding services including defaulter tracing and 
d. the patient must be residing in the barangay where the hospital is located.

If any of the following requirements above are not satisﬁed, the patient must be referred to the health center nearest his residence to ensure compliance to treatment.

3.4. All referrals shall be registered regardless of whether they are enrolled in the hospital or referred to the health centers and must be classified as such.

3.5. TB patients who will be referred to the DOTS clinic shall be provided with the following: discharge summary, referral slip, and photocopy of laboratory results. This shall be checked and given to the NTP Coordinator upon enrollment by the TB patient.

3.6. A treatment partner from the DOTS Clinic shall be assigned to supervise the daily intake of drugs of each patient at the clinic.

3.7. Enrolled TB cases shall be provided with both the treatment card and an NTP ID card. TB cases referred to health centers, on the other hand, shall be given the same.

X-ray positive cases - end of 2nd month

Monitoring of extra-pulmonary TB cases shall be in accordance with agreed protocol within the hospital.

3.12. At the end of the prescribed duration of treatment, patients shall be declared cured/completed based on laboratory results and assessment of the patient by the NTP coordinator/attending physician.

4. On Counseling

Good communication through counseling is very important in the treatment process of every TB patient enrolled in the NTP. An interview which includes patient’s drug history, knowledge of the disease, attitudes towards treatment compliance and others should be conducted.

4.1. The HEPO or hospital staff trained/experienced in health counseling shall be assigned in hospital wards and OPD to render counseling services, especially on the importance of treatment compliance.

4.2. A counselor must be sensitive with the patient’s physical condition during counseling. If the patient is not capable of spending more time through interview, he or she must be given enough time or continue at the soonest possible time he or she is available. The counselor must explain the importance of counseling and treatment compliance without leaving the patient untreated during the ﬁrst treatment day.

4.3. A patient shall be made aware that tuberculosis is a life threatening disease and treatment is only effective if all his prescribed drugs are taken for the entire treatment period. Taking only part of the prescribed drugs is risky because the disease may become incurable. This must be emphasized well to the patient for him to internalize the importance of patient compliance to treatment.

4.4. Continuous communication through counseling and reminding of the patient to comply to his drug regimen is also effective when rapport is already established during the initial visit.

4.5. Continuous health counseling shall be given to the patients/family throughout the treatment short course, if possible.

4.6. Rapport with the patient and the treatment partner must be established through the initiative of the NTP counselor.

C. Health Education / Community Involvement

Health education and community development are two related concepts that are considered effective in increasing the level of compliance among patients. Below are the following guidelines that help in the implementation of these two concepts:

1. During first contact/meeting with a patient, which usually happens during registration to NTP TB Register, the patient must be informed about his disease. Make sure he/she feels comfortable enough to ask you things he/she does not understand. Keep in mind that the patient is probably very sick and might still be feeling distressed about having the disease. Ask the patient essential questions throughout the discussion to make sure he understands what is being said. During later discussions with the patient, the following shall be explained further:

- duration of his treatment
- the importance of regularly taking his prescribed drugs
- that TB is a life threatening disease and that he may have already transmitted the infection to the family members
- that he will continue to transmit TB if he does not take all drugs
- that TB treatment is only effective if he takes all his drugs for the entire prescribed period. It is dangerous to take only some drugs because the disease may become incurable.

2. When you ﬁrst meet the patient, explain the following to him about tuberculosis:

- What is tuberculosis
- Treatment of tuberculosis
— Necessity of closely supervised drug intake during the intensive phase
- How tuberculosis is spread
— Symptoms of tuberculosis

3. Continuous health education to patients must be done throughout the treatment course. The following information should be communicated:

- Type and color of prescribed drugs/injection
- Amount and frequency of drugs/inj ection
- Possible side effects of drugs/injection
- Frequency and importance of sputum follow—up examinations
- Simple definitions of sputum results
- What happens if a patient takes his drugs irregularly
- What happens if a patient does not complete his treatment

4. All hospital-based DOTS personnel should be advocates of NTP.

5. The Infectious Disease Ofﬁce (TB—IDO) of the National Center for Disease Prevention & Control (NCDPC) and Center for Health Development (CHD) shall provide prototype of IEC materials to the hospitals. Hospitals are also encouraged to develop their own IEC materials.

6. Community involvement shall be highly encouraged through the creation of organizations/clubs which are to be composed of patients, families and health staff. This, however, must be preperly guided and supervised by the TB committee; thereby, providing Opportunities for people participation.

D. On Monitoring and Evaluation

1. Monitoring report shall be submitted to the Infectious Disease Office, NCDPC by the Regional NTP Coordinators as agreed by hospital concerned.

2. The hospital NTP Coordinator shall participate in the regional NTP consultative workshop to evaluate the program and identify problems and issues and how these should be tackled.

3. Annual Performance Report shall be submitted to the Hospital Chief, copy furnished CHDs, TB Unit - lDO, NCDPC and TSG-HCWP/NCHFD.
