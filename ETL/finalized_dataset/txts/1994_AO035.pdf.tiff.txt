7. OPERATIONAL REQUIREMENTS

7.1 All x-ray examinations shall be performed inside a room that is properly shielded in accordance with Section 6.

7.2 Doors leading to the x-ray examination room shall be closed during x-ray examinations.

7.3 The useful beam shall be collimated to the area of clinical interest.

7.4 In order to minimize the frequency of unintentional irradiation of the embryo or fetus, the following advisory notice should be posted at several places within diagnostic x-ray departments (particularly at its reception area) and other areas where diagnostic x-ray equipment is used,

IF IT IS POSSIBLE THAT YOU MIGHT BE PREGNANT, NOTIFY THE PHYSICIAN BEFORE YOUR X-RAY EXAMINATION.

7.5 When pregnant women require other x-ray examinations in which the x-ray beam irradiates the fetus directly, special care has to be taken to ascertain that the x-ray examination is indeed indicated at that time and that it should not be delayed until after the pregnancy. Sometimes the radiation risk to the fetus is less than that of not making the necessary diagnosis, so that the x-ray examination should still be done when medical indications are appropriate. In such cases, greater than usual care should be taken to minimize the absorbed dose in the fetus for each irradiation. However, alterations of technique should not reduce unduly the diagnostic value of the x-ray examination.

7.6 Radiography of areas remote from the fetus, such as the chest, skull or extremities, can be done safely at any time during pregnancy if the x-ray equipment is properly shielded and if proper x-ray beam limitation is used.

7.7 Sensitive body organs (e.g. lens of the eye, gonads) shall be shielded whenever they are likely to be exposed to the useful beam provided that such shielding does not eliminate useful diagnostic information.

7.8 When patients must be held during examinations, all efforts shall be undertaken to avoid having assistance provided by persons who work within the x-ray department. No pregnant woman or persons under the age of 18 years shall be permitted to hold patients. Persons holding the patients shall wear protected aprons and gloves. Even if protective clothing is worn, those holding the patients shall make sure as far as practicable, that no part of their body, even if covered by protective clothing is in the path of the useful beam.

7.9 Only persons whose presence is necessary shall be in the x-ray room during exposures. All such persons shall be protected (e.g. provided with lead aprons, leaded gloves, and/or movable shields).

7.10 The x-ray/radiologic technologists shall stay behind the protective barrier provided and shall observe the patient during x-ray examination. Means should be provided for communicating with the patient.

7.11 Radiographic films shall not be used beyond the expiration date indicated in the manufacturer's recommendations.

7.12 Radiographic cassettes and intensifying screens shall be cleaned regularly according to the instructions of the manufacturer.

7.13 All medical x-ray examinations shall have written results signed by the qualified physician as given in section 4.1.2.

7.14 A medical x-ray examination shall only be performed when there is a request from a referring physician. However, when a physician refers a patient for an imaging procedure, it should be understood that the patient is being referred for an opinion. If there is a significant risk to the patient or it is believed that such a request is inappropriate, it is both the right and duty of the qualified physician as described in Section 4.1.1, to refuse to undertake any particular procedure. A legitimate and logical reason for such refusal shall be provided to the referring physician.

7.15 If two or more medical x-ray examinations are readily available and give the necessary diagnostic information, then the procedure that presents the least overall risk to the patient shall be chosen.

7.16 Requests for x-ray examination shall be signed by the referring physician and shall include the following information in legible form:

7.16.1 Patient's name, age, sex, status, and address.
7.16.2 Date of request, brief clinical history and examination requested.
7.16.3 Tentative diagnosis.
7.16.4 Name of referring physician

7.17 Fluoroscopy shall not be used as a substitute for radiography.

7.18 Fluoroscopy shall be performed only by or under the immediate supervision of physicians possessing qualifications described in 4.1.1.1 and 4.1.1.2.

7.20 Fluoroscopy without image intensifier shall not be used.

7.21 Mobile x-ray machine, shall be used only when it is not possible to transfer patients to fixed installations. If this were the case, the x-ray/radiologic technologists and other persons within the area shall stay at least 2 meters from the patient, the x-ray tube, and the useful beam. If this is not possible, movable shields shall be provided.

7.22 During the use of a mobile x-ray machine, the x-ray/radiologic technologists shall wear a protective apron with 0.25 mm lead equivalence.

7.23 During the use of a mobile x-ray machine, the x-ray/radiologic technologists shall ensure that no person other than the patient will be exposed to the useful beam.

7.24 During cinefluorographic and serial radiography procedures, all personnel required in the room shall stay behind movable shields when possible.

7.25 In serial radiography, the number of films per second and the duration of the procedure shall be kept to a minimum consistent with the needs of the examination.

7.26 During the use of the computed tomographic machine, the slice thickness shall be as big as possible and the number of slices shall be as small as practicable.

7.27 All x-ray examinations shall be performed only when necessary for obtaining diagnostic information.

7.28 All x-ray examinations shall be performed only by or under the immediate supervision of qualified personnel described in Section 4.

ANNEX I

Minimum half value layer (mmAl) for single and three phase units and minimum total filtration at various tube potentials.

Note: A minimum beam filtration is required to attenuate very low energy x-rays that are absorbed in the patient with minimum diagnostic benefit. The amount of beam filtration required depends mainly on the kVp, which in turn, is related to the thickness of the body part examined. HVL values are easily measured and serve as a useful determination of total filtration (inherent plus external) which is not always easily seen. The measured HVL should not exceed the table values.

<image>table_1.png</image>

7 The half value layer (HVL) of the useful beam for a given x-ray tube potential (kVp) shall not be less than 0.3 mm Al at 30 kVp and shall not be more than 4.1 mm Al at 150 kVp.
