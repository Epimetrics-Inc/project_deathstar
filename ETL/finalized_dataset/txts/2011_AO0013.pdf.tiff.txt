<subject>SUBJECT: Implementing Guidelines on the DOH Complete Treatment Pack to Ensure Sustainable Access to Essential Drugs and Medicines for the Marginalized Sectors </subject>


<body>
I. RATIONALE 

As the current Administration gears'toward the achievement of Universal Health Care (UHC) by 2016, it has to ensure additional resources for essential medicines, which is one the vital components of any functioning health system to enable it to deliver quality health services that will bring about better health outcomes for its people. With the epidemiological shift that the Philippines is now experiencing where the top leading causes of deaths and diseases are both communicable and non-communicable diseases (NCDs),with a pre-dominance of NCDs, the - availability and affordability of needed maintenance drugs to optimally control diseases like hypertension, diabetes, asthma and COPD bring the issue of access to medicines to focus as health facility surveys conducted by the DOH and WHO consistently show poor availability of these medicines in the public sector (WHO 2009). Several issues contribute to the problem such as the lack of national and local ﬁnancing for medicines, inefﬁcient pharmaceutical procurement practices, poor management and the lack of human resources to prescribe and dispense medicines at the point of service delivery. 

Furthermore, with the paramount goal to increase patient’s access to low cost quality medicines while at the same time emphasizing the importance of rational drug use, the P100 Program was launched by the DOH and piloted in government hospitals in 2008 providing affordable treatment packs in the public sector although these were still sold to patients. 

One of the measures that the government may avail of to promote and ensure access to quality drugs and medicines is to enter into mutually and socially beneficial agreements with pharmaceutical companies, under certain conditions such as pooled procurements of essential drugs for DOH programs to increase their affordability and improve availability in public health facilities. 

Public-private partnerships (PPPs) are meant to improve outcomes and increase efficiency in operations as well as expand the limited reach of government by attaining what it cannot attain when acting alone. Partnerships are meant to achieve win-win situations that lead to better health outcomes. PPPs serve a list of purposes that help us achieve a common collective goal, mainly better health outcomes in pursuit of nation building.
