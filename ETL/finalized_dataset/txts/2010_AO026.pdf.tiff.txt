<subject>SUBJECT: Implementing Guidelines on the Medical Health Care Assistance Program of the Department of Health. </subject>


<body>
I. BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE 

In 1996, the General Appropriations Act (RA No. 8174) allodated Php 9,500,000.00 for the Medical Care Assistance Program of the Department of Health. It was intended as ﬁnancial assistance to selected government hospitals, to subsidize the cost of medical/health care services to conﬁned indigent patients and under-privileged veterans. 

The program was lodged at the Ofﬁce of the Secretary, and a Medical Assistance Desk Ofﬁcer was assigned to assist all patients seeking medical assistance. In 1997, the increasing number of patients served by the program required the creation of a Public Assistance Unit (PAU), thereat. 

In 2000, funds amounting to two million (Php 2, 000,000.00) per hospital were allocated to each of the four (4) Specialty Hospitals of the Department of Health, namely, the Philippine Heart Center (PHC), the Lung Center of the Philippines (LCP), the Philippine Children’s Medical Center (PCMC), and the National Kidney and Transplant Institute (NKTI), to support the medical needs of indigent patients referred to the said hospitals by the Secretary of Health. The medical needs included drugs and medicines, medical supplies, surgical operations and other special procedures performed for indigent patients, A01101—A entitled “Management of the Indigency Fund at the DOH Specialty Hospitals”. . 

With the implementation of the Hospital Reforms in 1999, the DOH hospitals enhanced their ﬁnance management and accountability systems. To support the medical needs of indigent patients, A0133 and A0 7—Bs.01 entitled “Guidelines in the Management of Fund of JRMMC” was therefore formulated and issued. This was intended to subsidize drugs and medicines, medical supplies, surgical operations and other special procedures, funds in the amount of Php 3, 000,000.00 were provided to Jose R. Reyes Memorial Medical Center in 2000. 

Other DOH retained hospitals were likewise provided with funds in 2003, namely, Cotabato Regional Medical Center (CRMC), Davao Medical Center (DMC), East Avenue Medical Center (EAMC), Eastern Visayas Regional Medical Center (EVRMC), Western Visayas Medical Center (WVMC), Paulino J. Garcia Memorial Medical Center (PJGMMC), Philippine Orthopedic Center (POC) and Sulu Sanitarium. In 2004, Tondo Medical Center also became 'a recipient pursuant to AOl60s. 04 entitled “Management of the Indigency Fund at the Tondo Medical Center”. 

Additional budget in recent years provided an opportunity for the program to further expand its coverage to more health facilities. Likewise, the MHCAP is in support of the implementation of Executive Order No. 867 entitled “Providing for the adoption of the National Household targeting system for poverty reduction as the mechanism for identifying poor households who shall be recipient of social protection program nationwide”.
