<body>

For the preper implementation of Item N, Section 52, Rule VIII of the Implementing Rules and Regulation of Republic Act 7875 entitled “National Insurance Act of 1995” that provides “professional fees for services rendered by salaried public health service providers may be retained by the health care institution in which services are rendered for pooling and distribution among health personnel. The manner of distributing the professional fees is left to the discretion of the health care institution”, the following are the guidelines:

1.) All Department of Health retained and renationalized hospitals shall create a “common fund” where the professional fees (PF) for services rendered to Medicare patients shall be pooled and distributed among hospital workers.

2.) All hospital workers, whether Medical, (Doctor) or Non-Medical (non-Doctors) are entitled to a share from the "common fund” including those attending seminars/workshops, conferences and/or lectures, and in—service training as covered by corresponding Department Orders and/or Hospital Orders. All those hospital workers who are on vacation, sick and/or maternity leaves, on leave for study grants or tours abroad are entitled to a share from this “common fund” during such absences.

Personnel who are on suspension, and on leave without pay shall not be entitled to the common fund. Personnel who are undergoing in—service training shall receive their share of the common fund from their sending agency.

3.) For the purpose of grOuping the hospital staff, they are classiﬁed into Medical and Non-medical personnel. The Dentist is included in the medical group.

4.) The Professional Fee (PF) paid by Medicare patients to the attending physician, whether full time or part time medical staff of the hospital shall be classiﬁed into:

a.) Medicare professional fee (MPF) — the amount allocated by Medicare to pay for the PF of the attending physician.

b.) Over and above professional fee (OPF) — the difference between the prevailing PF of the attending physician and MPF.

5.) All of the MPF except that of private patients shall be pooled into a “common fund”

6.) Payment for the Philippine Medical Association (PMA), Local Component Society Annual dues and Philippine Health Insurance Corporation (PHIC) Accreditation Fee of Medical staff shall be deducted ﬁrst from the common fund after which, the common ﬁmd shall be divided as follows: 50% for medical professional and 50% for non-medical personnel. After which, these respective funds shall be divided equally among their members. However, professional fees from private patients shall be collected and paid to the Attending Physicians through the Hospital Billing and Collection Unit as stated in Administrative Order No. 172, s. 2001 (Policies and Guidelines on the Private Practice of Medical and Paramedical Professionals in Government Health Facilities.

7.) Each group (Medical and Non-medical) may create a contingency fund based on their needs out of their 50% share of the “common fund”. The amount should be deducted ﬁrst from the share of the group before dividing it equally among its members.

8.) Part Time Medical Staff shall get only half of their share of Full Time Medical Staff.

9.) Proper accounting of the disbursements cf “common fund” shall be established by the hospital concerned.

All concerned are enjoined to observe these guidelines.
