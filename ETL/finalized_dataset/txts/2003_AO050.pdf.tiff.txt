<body>
I. Background

The promotion and maintenance of the health of the citizens in a country is an essential ingredient to national development. In order to attain specific national health objectives, the Department of Health (DOH) has to lead and coordinate the health sector. The health sector is complex, it being made up of various organizations and units. The DOH as an organization within the sector is itself big and complex. The local government, now mandated by the Local Government Code of 1991 to provide the frontline outpatient health services, is further composed of numerous offices and facilities, each having their own complex organizations. The private health sector, which include the providers and suppliers of goods, machines and services that the health sector needs, are also complex organizations.

If DOH has to successfully lead the whole health sector, it has to be internally cohesive and effective in planning, managing and coordinating health programs. Over the years, DOH programs have undergone numerous changes that have to be well disseminated down to all frontline health facilities. Health priorities change and response to these changes have to be quick and effective. Institutional memory of past programs and recent breakthroughs in scientific knowledge have to be constantly reviewed, tested, blended, integrated, simplified or synthesized.

Traditionally, the DOH is a vertically-run organization where policies and program strategies are formulated at the central office. National program managers of varying training, qualifications and experience have to design, test and disseminate health ideas, working closely with partners like the World Health Organizations (WHO) and UNICEF in transforming international experience into local interventions.

Because of the complexity and magnitude of the problems and interventions, there is uneven implementation of various health programs nationwide, some fully developed and mature like the immunization program and the TB prevention and control program, while others still needing major improvements.

Even at its best, a vertically-run DOH organization can no longer adequately manage the many tasks and changes. In complex organizations, no one can really have full control over entire processes. Control can only be achieved When concerned units work together as a team to manage the process together. To attempt to strengthen a vertically-run organization is not the solution to the above-named predicaments. The only sustainable solution is to take control of key processes through better communication and empowerment of various decision units throughout the organization. The DOH has to change its way of managing its leadership role.

To do this, the current DOH administration is ushering in a new era where the emphasis is shifted from technical health programs - putting formulation of new technical health programs "on hold" and streamlining the implementation of already formulated technical programs - to "systems improvement" programs. Streamlining of technical programs will be done through streamlining of the systems and processes by which plans and operations are carried out. This is really a way to de-clutter the health care delivery system of runaway policies, guidelines and procedures. Using quality improvement tools, a method of self-clean-up wOuld be in place that would lead to clarification and interconnection of processes and implementers of these processes, leading to better control of the entire health delivery system.

For CY 2003-2004, the One Script Work and Financial Planning is the first step in the implementation of the "getting connected" systems improvement program. The five Strategic priorities of the current DOH administration shall be the fundamental policy to guide the "script writing". Even as new health thrusts emerge with each change in administration, the processes and procedures instituted using the 5 current thrusts shall remain as a way to maintain interconnectedness among the various offices and units in the DOH and the health sector as they go through constant change and improvement.

II. Program Description and Scope

The "One Script Systems Improvement Program" shall focus on systems improvement rather than on technical health programs. Systems improvement aims to standardize management and operations processes through the:

■ consistent use of systemic evidence-based system and processes analysis model
■ team management techniques.

The program shall be initially institutionalized within DOH to effect changes and improvements in all major processes from the top management processes of policy and strategy formulation to operations processes within all the DOH field units - regional and hospital levels. Once institutionalized within the DOH, other organizations, units and stakeholders of the health sector such as the local health units at the provincial and municipal levels, the providers and users of health services, both public and private - shall be more actively involved in the change process.

III. Program Goal

To improve the effectiveness. of the DOH as the leader of the health sector in achieving national health objectives. The DOH leadership will be more effective when its organization and the other organizations within the health sector have better control of the major systems and processes in health planning and management so that these truly create health impact as intended

IV. Objectives and Targets

By the end of 2003:

A. To install the systemic evidence-based management and processes analysis model to guide health planning and operations through clearer role definition and complementation and better use of field data and indicators of multi-sector performance;

B. To use team management techniques to design effective, practical, interconnected processes using systematic team problem solving tools, self-monitoring and shared feedback mechanisms;

C. To train and organize one-script teams and monitoring and coaching teams that shall institutionalize and maintain the proper utilization of the above-named quality improvement techniques and approaches

Starting in 2004:

To expand the installation of the One-script Systems Improvement Program to include local government systems and the systems of other partners within the health sector

V. Policies, Direction And Priorities

The Systems Improvement Program shall be guided by these fundamental policies, priorities and thrusts:

A. The National Health Objectives shall continue to guide specific health targets. However, the following five current strategic priorities within these objectives shall be given focus:

1. To lower the price of medicines and make quality health services affordable (Affordability): The primary program is the GMA 50- Gamot na Mabisa at Abot Kayang Halaga. Other projects and programs to reduce cost of medicines and services shall be developed, such as the promotion of high quality, low cost, locally manufactured generic products, local financing schemes and cost-saving programs.

2. To make quality primary, secondary and tertiary care services, as appropriate, more accessible to underserved in rural and urban communities (Accessibility): The primary program is the social health insurance through the Philippine Health Insurance Corporation. Other programs and projects to improve access to quality primary and hospital services shall be included such as the completion of the hospital development plan, the development of diagnostic facilities and Sentrong Sigla certification

3. To prevent epidemics and diseases and their undesirable consequences (Prevention of diseases and epidemics): The primary programs are the National TB Program (NTP), the Expanded Program on Immunization (EPI), the Micronutrient Program (especially salt iodization and Vitamin A supplementation and fortification), Maternal Care and Family Planning Program and the Rabies Prevention and Control Program

4. To enable citizens to live healthy lifestyles as individuals, families and communities (Promotion of Healthy Lifestyle, including responsible parenthood): This includes programs to actively promote healthy diet (including exclusive breastfeeding & proper complementary feeding), adequate physical activity and responsible parenthOod, and the prevention and cessation of smoking and alcohol and drug abuse.

5. To protect citizens from fake, substandard products and services (Protection): This includes the transformation of BFAD and its regional units into efficient and effective regulatory units, as well as programs to strengthen all regulatory functions and networks.

B. To contribute to the building of a Strong Republic under the administration of President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo, emphasis shall be on the State of the Nation Address (SONA) and the National Socio-Economic Summit (NSES) commitments.

C. Allocation and realignment of resources among the DOH units shall be based on good performance of action plans as verified by intensified monitoring activities.

D. In the light of the process improvement, processes and procedures that are determined to be no longer necessary shall be discontinued. These may include:

1. Routine program-specific (involving only specific program managers) consultative workshops, review and reports. All programs should be developed and monitored in an integrated manner during meetings and reviews of assigned cross-functional teams. This will be more difficult for national managers but will be better for the teams since the applicability of nationally proposed interventions will immediately be validated using specific conditions in each regions.

2. Conduct of nationally-initiated activities that have not yet gone through the One Script planning process: these include trainings, surveys, symposia and other activities that are not related to previously planned IEC campaigns. This is to encourage advanced planning of 1-2 years for all such activities.

Campaign-related, program specific consultative and preparatory meetings may still continue, provided these have been previously scheduled for the year and/or unless initiated by top management as a new priority for urgent reasons.

VI. Strategies

A. Use of system modeling for better, inter-unit communication and complementation and joint identification of strong and weak links: System models were developed for the five thrusts and broad strategies identified by the current DOH administration (Refer to Annex A). Additional system models are provided for central DOH teams (Refer to Annex B). The pertinent DOH cross-functional teams shall clarify their roles in each model and identify the strongest and weakest components in the model by supplying the neceSsary data and indicators relevant to their areas of responsibility. The system model analysis approach is detailed below.

B. Organization of cross-functional teams: One Script Teams (OSTs) shall conduct Continuing, systematic team problem solving and process designing while Monitoring and Coaching Teams (MCTs) shall ensure the translation of thrusts and priorities into more detailed strategies and action plans.

VII. Procedures for Cross Functional Teams

For One Script Teams (OST):

A. System modeling

This is a way of graphically putting together the various components, inputs and processes that work together to produce a particular outcome. This method can illustrate where linkages should be and where components or linkages are weak. With the use of concrete data about the various components, the analysis can show whether the desired outcomes are really achieved. This is also a good method to communicate with various groups in a big organization especially when different units of the organization contribute to various inputs and processes. System modeling is a good way to organize group discussions, progress and plans.

The OSTs shall follow the steps below to use these models:

1. Analyze the models and modify, if needed, to include other components (inputs, processes or outcomes) that are relevant to your situation. Complete the data checklists for all models.
2. Provide the appropriate data as needed using as a guide the data checklists developed. Identify additional data needs, if necessary.
3. Using the data, assess whether your system is performing the way it should be.
4. Identify weak or missing components, areas where quality falls short, or where good data is lacking.
5. Use the findings to plan for solutions to problems identified.
6. Develop additional system models, if necessary.

B. Systematic team problem solving

This is a method of using data and resource persons who know and really understand the problem to analyze the root cause of the problem and to formulate good, practical solutions as a team. It is best that the OSTs organize systematic team problem solving when good, reliable data are available and when the right people involved in the problem are in the meeting. It is also important to have the right attitude during these sessions, that is, to have genuine motivation to find practical solutions. Many root cause analysis sessions fail because of lack of data, poor use of data, lack of relevant people, or poor attitude.

The systematic team problem solving sessions should end with clear agreements and commitments to action by each team member to pursue the solutions. For particularly difficult problems, some solutions may be tentative and need to be tested first before these are accepted as the best solution for the problem, This may mean that a series of systematic team problem solving sessions are needed for particularly chronic or difficult problems before finalizing the best solution to be fully implemented.

The central level teams should be alert on international and local trends such as those related to new insights and technologies, economical and financial developments, socio-cultural needs and changes, and political and legal factors. Testing and incorporation of proven interventions should be more deliberate and more systematic to avoid waste of resources.

C. Process designing

To plan to execute a solution or any intervention, the OSTs should decide what to do by defining the steps and procedures, who will do what and how, in collaboration with whom, in what sequence or timing with what resources (goods, information, services, people's time, equipment, funds). This should be described through a process flowchart that may start with general tasks and functions. However, targets and indicators of performance (major final outputs) should be clear and concrete. Detailed steps may be added later on by persons who will actually do the tasks. Data collection and decision steps should be marked in the flowchart.

The process design should be reviewed and finalized through simulation.

D. Performance reviews

1. Monthly reviews

This should be centered on the review of the process - whether the assigned persons are doing their assigned processes according to the process design.

Step 1: Compare outputs with targets
Step 2: Check the variation of the performance over the month
Step 3: Check the inputs: (e.g. change in supplier; Material
Step 4: Check the wise use of resources
Step 5: Check the flow and soundness of the activities (e.g. Animal bite centers - not worth doing because it will not affect prevention and control; besides, bites are better treated immediately and properly at home)

During the monthly reviews, the team should be able to detect and correct sporadic process dysfunction or non-compliance with the agreed steps and procedures. Modifications in any step in the process, unless there is an obvious mistake, are preferably done during quarterly reviews to have more data and to give more time for the processes to be understood by the assigned staff.

2. Quarterly reviews:

The OSTs should follow same major steps as in the monthly reviews. This time the team should be able to observe variations of performance over a longer period of time and thus detect and correct systematic process dysfunction, for example, frequent delays in drug distribution. Efficiency measurements - time spent, resources allocated, etc. - can also be better reviewed with more data available over time. This is a good time to institute improvements in efficiency, to simplify complicated processes and to innovate new and better ways of doing things.

3. In depth reviews

The OSTs should identify areas of concern where in depth review is needed in their area. These are usually concerns where data is unsatisfactory or those needing the voice of clients or partners. In depth and comprehensive reviews are useful in gathering first hand opinions and impressions of the actual situation.

In depth review using survey methodology may be conducted and should, in fact be planned to be done annually. As many programs as possible should be integrated in such reviews to generate balanced recommendations .for improvements. Regional offices may initiate their own comprehensive or in depth reviews. (refer to Annex C for an In-Depth Review Guide)

E. Reporting formats

There shall be three reporting forms to include the following (Refer to Annex D):
1. Form OST - 1: Results of Systems Analysis
2. Form OST - 2: Performance Indicators
3. Form OST - 3: Results of Reviews

Monthly reports are to be submitted to MCT leaders, who, in turn, will analyze these, identifying issues needing action at central office level, and outlining action options and recommending preferred actions, for presentation at ExecutiVe Committee (Execom) meetings. Consolidated performance trends shall be prepared by the Information Management Service (IMS).

For Monitoring and Coaching Team (MCI):

The MCTs are crucial to the success of the One Script Program because they are the groups that disseminate the policies and new procedures and make sure that these policies and procedures are followed properly. A script is useless if the players do not follow it.

The spirit of monitoring should not be to find fault or to ridicule anyone, but to find areas that the team can help improve. Reviews should be regarded as open and shared with the spirit of genuine concern to solve problems, not to cause embarrassment when weaknesses are discussed. Thus, the members of the MCT should be well prepared to handle such situations. This will be done, though training of the MCT members.

It is also crucial that MCT members truly understand and internalize the policies, strategic priorities & goals. Personal preference, biases and doubts should be carefully threshed out during the training. (Annex E shows the specific tools and procedures for MCTs).

Determining Baselines Performances

I. OBJECTIVES:

1. To determine current level of performance which may facilitate interpretation of future monitoring results;

2. To provide some idea of the availability and integrity of required source records of information.

II. DEFINITION:

Baseline data is a measurable variable used as a standards or reference in evaluating the performance of an organization. Baseline may be based on current trends and the best projections available or it may be drawn from existing research, planning document, internal experience of the organization or from legal requirement.

III. PURPOSE

Baseline is often used to gauge changes in performance over time. Its purpose is to provide a benchmark against which the effectiveness of strategies, which are implemented, can be evaluated. Performance of the unit regarding set targets. may be interpreted/understood better when related to baseline data.

<image>figure_22.png</image>

Monitoring

I. PURPOSE

> To achieve efficient and effective performance by providing feedback to management at all levels in improving operational plans and taking timely corrective actions in case of shortfalls and constraints

II. DEFINITIONS

> Continuous or periodic surveillance over the implementation of an activity to ensure that input deliveries, work schedules, targeted outputs and other required action are proceeding according to plan

> Routine gathering, documentation and reporting of accomplishment against measures of expected performance

III. PHASES OF MONITORING;

> Gathering information

> Analysis of information

> Providing support or intervention (actions to be taken)

IV. MONITORING STRATEGIES/DATA COLLECTION

1. Direct Observations

Teams of observers record what they see and hear at a site, using a detailed observation form. Observation may be of physical surroundings or of ongoing activities, processes or discussions.

2. Key Informant Interviews

Involves interviews with key individuals selected for their knowledge and to reflect diverse views. interviews are qualitative, in-depth and semi structured. Interview guides listing topics are used, but questions are framed during the interview, using insinuating probing techniques

3. Focus Groups

Several homogenous groups (of 8 to 12 each) discuss issues and experiences among themselves. A moderator introduces the topic, stimulates and focuses discussion, and prevents domination of discussion by a few.

4. Surveys

Involves interviews of individuals, usually selected using non-probability sampling techniques. Structured, questionnaires are used that focus on a limited number of closed-ended questions. Generates quantitative data that can often be collected and analyzed quickly.

5. Records Review

Includes review of records, plans and other documents pertinent to what is being analyzed. This can also generate quantitative data that can be collected and analyzed quickly.

6. Plenary Presentation

A more active approach in reviewing documents which involves presentations of information in a plenary session. This can also generate quantitative data that cart be collected and analyzed quickly.

V. KEY TERMS IN MONITORING
