Technical Services, Regional. Health. Offices, or external
sources, the USEC/COS, with staff support from the HPDS,'will
consolidate the responses into a DOH position paper through a
consultative process-and forward it to the Congress through
the DLLO with copies furnished to the concerned Technical
Service/Regional Health Office. DOH personnel _ from the
Technical Services or regional Health Offices will be
requested to appear at Congressional Hearings.

4. The DLLO will monitor the responses once they have been sent
