<subject>SUBJECT: National Policy on Strengthening the Prevention and Control of Chronic Lifestyle Related Non Communicable Disease </subject>


<body>
I. BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE 

Cardiovascular diseases (CVD), cancers, chronic respiratory diseases and diabetes (DM) are among the top killers in the Philippines, causing more than half of all deaths annually. Hypertension and diseases of the heart are among the ten leading causes of illnesses each year. These diseases are collectively known as Lifestyle Related Non-Communicable Diseases (NCDS), as defined in the National Objectives for Health 2005-2010, particularly because these diseases have common risk factors which are to a large extent related to unhealthy lifestyle. 

The risk factors involved are tobacco use, unhealthy diet, physical inactivity and alcohol use. The Food and Nutrition Research Institute (FNRI) National Nutrition and Health Surveys in 1998 to 2008 (Acuin and Duante, 2010) showed that there is increasing prevalence in the associated risk factors between 1998 to 2008: hypertension from 21% to 25.3 %; diabetes from 3.9% to 4.8%; among adults who are overweight, there has been a significant increase from 20.2% to 26.6%; and those with high blood cholesterol levels had increased from 4% to 10.2%. Furthermore, the study found out that the following groups are at risk for NCDs: age group from the 40’s onwards and those with Body Mass Index (BMI) 3 23, dyslipidemia, high waist circumference and waist hip ratios. Moreover, dietary intake trends show increasing consumption of energy dense foods high in fats and sugars, while almost the entire adult population has low levels of physical activity in all domains: occupation, non-occupation, leisure, transportation. ' 

Children and adolescents are also exposed to the above-mentioned risks. Latest data from the Global Adult Tobacco Survey in 2009 shows prevalence of tobacco use (current smokers) among population 15 years old and above to be 28.3% (17.3 million Filipinos); 47.7% of these are men (14.6 million) and 9% are women (2.8 million). On the other hand, the prevalence rate of overweight among adolescents 9-11 years old has increased two folds from 2.4% in 1993 to 4.8% in 2005. Similarly, the prevalence rate of overweight for children 6-10 years old doubled from 0.8% in 2001 to 1.6% in 2005. (Source: Philippine Nutrition Facts and Figures 2005). About 30% of teenage students are physically inactive, spending three or more hours per day sitting and watching television, playing computer games, talking with friends, or doing other sitting activities. (Source: Philippines Global School—based Student Health Survey, 2007). And, data shows that in 2008 hazardous alcohol intake stands at 26.9% (FNRI—NNHeS 2008). 

The Philippine Renal Disease Registry (PRDR) illustrates that for 2009, diabetic nephropathy, a complication of diabetes remained the most common etiology of end stage renal disease while clinical hypertensive nephrosclerosis, a complication of hypertension ranked as the second most common etiology of end stage renal disease. Unless something is done to control these non-communicable diseases, renal complications will escalate to a degree that will compromise the current capacity to care for these types of patients. 

Other non—communicable diseases which are not lifestyle-related include violence and injury. These are also major problems in the country. Thus, a policy on the prevention of violence and injury came into effect through Administrative Order No. 2007-0010. 

The cost of care of lifestyle-related non—communicable diseases may cause people to fall into poverty and create a downward spiral of worsening poverty and illness. They also undermine the country's economic development. In response to the increasing prevalence of lifestyle related diseases in the country, vertical programs on the prevention and control of cardiovascular diseases, cancers and diabetes were put in place in the mid 1990’s. The individual programs however, were focused on treatment and management of those who were already sick and thus were competing with each other for resources and for attention upon ﬁeld implementation. 

Recent evidence shows that the most cost-effective way of controlling these non- communicable lifestyle related diseases is by the prevention of the emergence of the risk factors in an integrated manner, employing health promotion strategies across the life course and intervening at the level of family and community. This is essential because the causal risk factors causing these illnesses are deeply entrenched in the social and cultural framework of the society. Thus, an integrated comprehensive program for the prevention and control of these non- communicable lifestyle related diseases has to be put in place. 

II. STATEMENT OF POLICY 

The prevention and control of chronic lifestyle related non communicable diseases shall be guided by the following policy statements. 

1. The country shall adopt an integrated, comprehensive and community based response for the prevention and control of chronic, lifestyle related NCDs. 

The underlying causes of NCDs are multi-faceted and are deeply rooted into the community and individual’s socio-economic status, cultural orientations and personal preferences. Key measures and interventions that help prevent and control NCDs lie beyond the health sector. An integrated, comprehensive and community-based approach shall be adopted in responding to these issues. 

2. Health promotion strategies shall be intensified to effect changes that would lead to a significant reduction in mortality and morbidity due to chronic, lifestyle related NCDs. 

There are three major changes that need to take place in order to achieve significant reduction in the morbidity and mortality due to NCDs. These require (i) changes in lifestyle of the individual and of the population, (ii) changes in the environment supportive to the desired improvement of lifestyles, and (iii) change in the way the overall health care delivery system works. It is believed that these three changes can be realized through health promotion. Health promotion entails 5 action areas which include (i) building healthy public policy (ii) creating supportive environments, (iii) strengthening community action, (iv) developing personal skills through information and education (v) reorienting health care services toward prevention of illness and promotion of health. 

3. Complementary accountabilities of all stakeholders must be ensured and actively pursued in the implementation of an integrated, comprehensive and community based response to chronic, lifestyle related NCDs. 

With devolution, the primary mandate of delivering basic health services was transferred to the LGUs. The DOH shall encourage LGUs to perform adequately in the area of NCD prevention and control. 

Also, since new directions in the health sector requires maximizing the participation of the private sector and Other stakeholders, public-private sector collaboratiOn shall be explored in the area of financing, service delivery, surveillance, capability building and other areas as necessary. 

III. GUIDING PRINCIPLES 

1. Equity. NCDs are highly prevalent among populations of low socio-economic status, thus the delivery of NCD prevention and control services should therefore be made accessible to all Filipinos with bias to those who are most vulnerable and disadvantaged. 

2. Sustainability. The desired reduction of disease burden and death due to NCDs can only be attained through unified and sustained efforts by all the concerned sectors at various levels of operations thus it is important for sustainability measures to be built-in to every NCD prevention and control initiative. 

3. Rights-Based. Respect of rights, gender and culture should characterize the delivery of NCD prevention and control services. . 

4. Continuum of Care throughout the Life Cycle. In order to generate optimum health for all, actions for NCD prevention and control should take into account the consistent practice of healthy lifestyle throughout the life cycle and must ensure that these are emphasized and pursued in various health programs using the life cycle approach. 

5. Evidenced-Based. Designing and implementing approaches for NCD prevention and control in the country must be based on scientific evidence thus the capability of stakeholders to collect, analyze and utilize these evidences must be enhanced.

VII. ACTION FRAMEWORK FOR THE PREVENTION AND CONTROL OF CHRONIC LIFESTYLE RELATED NON-COMMUNICABLE DISEASES: 

The Action Framework for the National Program on the Prevention and Control of Chronic Lifestyle Related Non-Communicable Diseases is based on the Causation Pathway Model for Major Chronic Diseases as contained in the WHO Western Paciﬁc Regional Action Plan for Addressing Non-Communicable Diseases, where the underlying determinants, common risk and intermediate risk factors that would lead to lifestyle-related diseases are identified (Figure 1)


Figure 1. Causation Pathway Model for Major Chronic Diseases 
<image>figure_1.png</image>

The action framework (Figure 2) has seven action areas as follows: (1) Environmental interventions; (2) Lifestyle interventions; (3) Clinical interventions; (4) Advocacy; (5) Research, surveillance, monitoring, and evaluation; (6) Networking and coalition building; and (7) Health system strengthening. It draws primarily from the WHO Western Paciﬁc Regional Framework for Addressing Non-communicable Diseases and emphasizes the requirement for integrated comprehensive approaches that encompass and address the various levels of determinants and risks for non—communicable lifestyle related diseases (Figure 2). 

Figure 2: Action Framework for the Prevention and Control of Chronic Lifestyle-Related Non-communicable Diseases 

<image>figure_2.png</image>

The framework clearly identiﬁes areas for intervention according to the causation pathway shown in Figure l by utilizing a comprehensive approach that simultaneously seeks to effect change at three levels: 1) Environment Interventions such as policy and regulatory . interventions seek to create a supportive environment for healthier choices. They address the multiple environmental determinants brought about, for example, by globalization and urbanization that give rise to the development of unhealthy lifestyles. 2) Lifestyle Interventions address the common risk factors and intermediate risk factors by providing population-based lifestyle interventions (for example, information and education and behavioural interventions for those who are already at risk). 3) Clinical Interventions, palliation and rehabilitation address the capacity of the health system to treat and manage diseases through screening, risk factor modification, clinical management, palliation and rehabilitation. To support change in these three levels of interventions, additional actions are needed in the following areas: advocacy; research, surveillance, monitoring and evaluation; networking and coalition building across all sectors of the government and society, and health system strengthening through primary health care to make it more responsive to chronic care. 

The framework highlights the balance between "healthy choices" and "healthy environments" because it recognizes that supportive environments are needed to empower healthy choices. It also redistributes responsibility across the whole of society, with government, the health sector, the private sector, nongovernmental organizations, communities, families and individuals all sharing accountability for putting in place the necessary elements that promote healthy lifestyles and quality care for non-communicable lifestyle related diseases. 

VIII. GENERAL GUIDELINES

iii. The acute attacks and exacerbations from failed prevention, financial barriers in access to acute care and financial risk that must be addressed by adequate financing. 

iv. The co—morbidities requiring coordination by various providers and teams that must be managed by proper governance infrastructure. 

4. Health care settings shall provide access and availability of services that collectively span the care continuum and to include (a) prevention and health promotion; (b) lifestyle interventions to modify risk factors; (c) screening; (d) clinical interventions for high-risk individuals and groups and those who are already sick; (e) rehabilitation; and (f) palliation. A fictional referral system shall be in place to facilitate access and ensure continuity of care across health facilities at various levels. 

5. Primary level health facilities such as rural health centers and primary hospitals shall provide appropriate services particularly on early detection and screening and primary prevention. Community participation shall also be enhanced to strengthen awareness on prevention and control of lifestyle-related diseases and to provide a supportive environment conducive for behavior change towards healthy lifestyle. 

6. Interventions shall address health equity concerns and take into consideration the needs of the most vulnerable and marginalized sectors. 

7. Services shall cater to various age groups addressing age-related needs throughout the human life cycle.
