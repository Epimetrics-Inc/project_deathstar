<subject>SUBJECT: National Policy on the Prevention and Management of Abortion Complications (PMAC)</subject>


<body>
I. BACKGROUND/RATIONALE 

Maternal mortality and morbidity due to complications from unsafe abortion is a public health, medical ethics and human rights issue. The latest data available on abortion reﬂects an - estimated 610,000 unsafe abortions, over 100,000 hospitalizations, and 1000 deaths of women due to abortion-related complications each year (Alan Guttmacher Institute (AGI), Unintended - Pregnancy and Induced Abortions in the Philippines: Causes and Consequences, page 3, 2013). Majority of these women are poor, married, Catholic and already have at least three children (Singh S et al., Unintended Pregnancy and Induced Abortion in the Philippines:- Causes and Consequences, New York: Guttmacher Institute, 2006). This translates to about 70 women who induced abortion every hour, 11 women hospitalizedevery hour and three women who die every day from unsafe abortion complications (AGI, Meeting Women’s Contraceptive Needs in the Philippines, 1 In Brief 2 (2009); citing 2008 projections from 2000 statistics on abortion incidence in the Philippines). 

To address the harmful impact of unsafe abortions in the country and contribute to the reduction in maternal mortality to meet the Philippine’s commitment to the Sustainable ' Development Goals to decrease the maternal mortality ratio to two-thirds of 2010 levels, a policy on the Prevention and Management of Abortion and its Complications (PMAC) is needed to ensure- safe and quality post abortion care enhanced with humane, respectful, non-judgmental, and compassionate approach to care. This new PMAC policy supersedes AO No. 45-Bs 2000. 

II. OBJECTIVES 

This Order is aimed to set overall policy directions and identify the roles and functions of Department of Health (DOH), its ofﬁces and partner agencies in the provision of quality post» abortion care in hospitals and all health facilities both public and private in the service delivery system. It shall also provide the guidelines for the integration of PMAC in the Reproductive Health (RH) programs.
