<doctype>ADMINISTRATIVE ORDER</doctype>
<docnum>No. 93 s. 2003</docnum>

<subject>Subject: Allowable Rates of Payment for Health Human Resource Development Activities of the Department of Health</subject>

<body>
I. Rationale:

Memorandum Circular (MC) No. 43, s. 1993 issued by the Civil Service Commission on 14 October 1993 provided for the streamlining and deregulation of human resource development functions. In view of this, the Department of Health (DOH) issued Department Memorandum (DM) No. 25, 3. 1995 dated 15 June 1995 which prescribed allowable rates for HRD activities. It further defined human resource development to include all orientation and training activities, workshops, seminars, conventions, assemblies, conferences, symposia, scholarships, fellowships and other human resource development strategies of this Department. Considering inflation and other economic factors, the allowable rates as prescribed in said DM 25 have been assessed to be unrealistic and not appropriate to prevailing conditions. This Order is therefore issued to prescribe adjusted and more reasonable rates for HRD activities.

II. Coverage:

This Order shall cover all health HRD activities sponsored and for conducted by the DOH which are funded by the Government of the Philippines (GOP) and Foreign Assisted Projects (FAPS).
