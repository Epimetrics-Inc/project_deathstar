<body>

I. BACKGROUND:

The CY 2001 Budget is the first budget for the Reengineered Department of Health.

To further advance the bold steps initiated for the health sector reforms, the budget for this year is focused on the full implementation and capability building of stakeholders for Health Sector Reform Agenda (HSRA).

However, the reenactment of CY 2000 Budget and the current budget deficit, has resulted in a considerable decrease in the CY 2001 Proposed Budget. Therefore, efﬁciency in utilization of available resources and focusing and prioritization of resource allocation becomes very important.
