<subject>SUBJECT: Additional Delegation to Regional Health Directors and Officers in Charge of Regional Health Offices Designated by the Minister of Health to Appoint Senior Resident Physicians in District/Emergency Hospitals in the Regions</subject>

<body>
In order to further decentralize the appointment process and thus expedite personnel transactions at the Regional level, Regional Health Directors and Officers in Charge of Regional Health Offices who have been designated by the Minister of Health are hereby delegated the authority to appoint Senior Resident Physicians in district or emergency hospitals.

Similar positions in provincial hospitals, whether these are teaching and training hospitals or not, are excluded in this delegation as part of the continuing program of this Office to upgrade the medical capabilities of these hospitals. Accordingly, such appointments shall as heretofore be prepared for the signature of the Minister of Health.

In the exercise of this delegated authority, the following provisions of Administrative Order No. 45 dated September 17, 1979 are hereby re-stated for strict compliance:

1. That the general policies of the Ministry of Health governing the selection, appointment and promotion of personnel embodied in existing administrative issuances as well as applicable civil service rules and regulations shall be strictly observed;

2. That certified xerox copies of all appointments issued under this delegated authority by the Regional Health Office concerned, which have been approved by the corresponding CSC Regional Office, together with the sworn personal data sheets and personal history statements of the appointees, shall be submitted in summary form at the end of every month to this Office for personnel review and control purposes.

3. That this delegation of authority shall not be construed as a limitation on the power of the Minister of Health to review and/or overrule any action taken by the Regional Health Director or Officer in Charge of the Regional Health Office concerned which does not conform with the existing policies of the Ministry.

4. The Regional Protests and Evaluation Committee shall undertake the resolution of protest cases of appointments signed under this delegated authority.

All appointments signed under this delegated authority shall bear the words “By authority of the Minister of Health” above the title of the signing official.

Any and all orders of the contrary are hereby superseded or revoked.

This Order takes effect October 1, 1981.
