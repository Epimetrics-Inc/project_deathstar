<subject>SUBJECT: Implementing Guidelines on Monitoring and Evaluation for Equity and Effectiveness (ME3) in Support of Health Sector Strengthening Through FOURmula One for Health</subject>

<body>
I. RATIONALE 

The DOH is vigorously pursuing health sector reform support through the Fourmula One for Health (F1) implementation strategy. To measure the progress on how F1 has contributed in attaining the goals and results that the health sector has set in terms of final health outcomes, responsiveness of the health system, equitable ﬁnancing, and equity, a Monitoring and Evaluation for Equity and Effectiveness (MES) System is being developed. 

ME3 is a system that aims to detennine if reforms have equitably and effectively achieved goals in the health system. It has been developed to measure health sector performance in terms of equity and effectiveness. 

ME3 aims to measure performance on “Equity" to improve the social conditions and provide adequate social protection for the poor. The poor and the underserved are the most significant clients, or the government because of the value of social justice, equity or fairness. This goal gains importance under a globalizing environment that may compromise opportunities and welfare of the poor. 

ME3 is also designed to measure the “Effectiveness” of F1 in achieving goals and outcomes of the health system and how these are achieved better and faster. The goals by which Ft shall be judged includes its desired final outcomes of improved health status, more equitable financing, and greater responsiveness of the health system. Effectiveness in achieving desired intermediate outcomes of access, quality, financial impact and efficiency in the health system shall also be assessed.

This order is being made to protride the policies and guidelines in the implementation of ME3. 

II. GOALS AND OBJECTIVES OF THE MES3 

A. General Objective: 

The ME3 shall primarily guide policy makers, program managers and stakeholders in the assessment otthe benefits of health reform efforts. 

B. Specific Objectives: 

1. To provide a uniform framework for monitoring and evaluation of F1 among all stakeholders that shall allow accurate measurements of outcomes most valuable to the Filipino poor.
2. To establish a system/set of procedures for generating, collecting, reporting, analyzing and using information to guide and enhanoe implementation ofreforms in the health sector. 
3. To advocate and institutionalize the use of scorecards which will measure and report comparative performances of stakeholders in asystem of open accountability. 

III. GENERAL PRINCIPLES 

1. ME3 shall be the monitoring and evaluation system to be used to track the progress at implementation of Fourmula One for health in the country 
2. The Performance indicator Framework (PIF) and Scorecard components of the ME3 shall be the tools to monitor F1 implementation. 
3. The PlF and different Scorecards shall be implemented inrall the province Wide health systems of the country, but with priority application to all the F1 sites for baseline gathering and pilot testing. 
4. The PlF shall be implemented every three to, five years with baseline gathering to start in 2008.
5. The scorecards for the DOH Central Office, DrOH—CHD, DOH- Hospitals and Donors shall be implemented yearly with baseline gathering to start in 2008. 
6. The LGU Scorecard outcome indicators shall be implemented yearly and output indicators every three years, both of which will have its baseline gathering in 2008.
7. A reporting mechanism for the M and E results shall be fovrmulated and institutionalized. 
8. Nationwide publication and dissemination of results shall be done yearly. Regional and provincial publications and dissemination. shall be under the discretion of the local officials of each speciﬁc area. 

IV. COMPONENTS OF ME3 

The Monitoring and Evaluation for Equity and Effectiveness (ME3) includes the 
following components: a) Performance Indicator Framework, (PlF); b) the Scorecards; c) Data System; and d) Management component, which are described as follows: 

A. Performance IndiCator Framework (PIF) for F1 

The PlF is a hierarchy of performance indicators on outcomes desired and outputs required for the Filipino people. The principles which have guided this hierarchy were impact on the poor, relevance to health outcome, and measurability. There are three levels of indicators in the hierarchy: the Final Outcomes, the Intermediate Outcomes and the Major Final Outputs. (see Annex A) 

1. Final Outcome Indicators. 
The indicators for Final Outcome are the highest level in the IF which reflects results, consequences or outcomes valuable to the Filipinos. Final Outcomes for the health system shall include:  

a. Health status, which measures the health at the population and includes a summary of major health indicators such as summary indicators for mortality and morbidity rates, prevalence of diseases and others; 
b. Financial Risk Protection or Equitable Health-care Financing, which measures the degree to Which all citizens are protected from the ﬁnancial risks of ill health, particularly the poor; 
c. Responsiveness of the Health System and Client Satisfaction, is the degree to which citizens are satisﬁed with the services provided by the health sector. It is the ability of the health system to respond to the non-health 0r non-clinical expectations of clients from the health system. 

2. Intermediate Outcome Indicators 
The second level of the hierarchy is composed of the performmce indicators for intermediate Outcomes which measure features of the health system that leads to the ﬁnal outcomes. It focuses on measuring the performance on the MDG, NOH and F1 outcomes for: 
a. Access, which represents physical availability of health care; 
b. Quality, which reﬂects compliance to speciﬁed standards; 
c. Efficiency, which includes allocative and technical efﬁCi'ency; and d. Financial Burden, which specifies the burden of major stakeholders in financing care. 

3. Major Final Output Indicators 
The third level in the hierarchy is composed of the indicators for Major Final Outputs (MFO's), which are products, goods and services' resulting from the; implementation of F1 strategies on service delivery (public health and hospitals), health financing, regulation and governance. MFO’s are goods and services that clients expect from the producer of such outputs for which the producer has the authority ormandate of producing, and is directly accountable for.

The PIF will apply two gauges to judge or measure performance on the outcomes and outputs. The first gauge involves looking at the performance level as national average of outcomes, Wherein the country‘s overall average performance can be used as a benchmark and compared with comparable countries, past performance or international/national goals. The second gauge Considers: performance distribution or equity distribution of outcomes among different groups (socio economic, gender, region, ethnicity, etc), and focuses on performance among the poorest groups in the popUIation. Assessing the distribution of performance measures across other groups will enable policy makers, planners/managers to identify groups that are doing poorly and guide efforts to improve equity. 

B. Scorecards 

Scorecards are tools for measuring and reporting on comparative performance of stakeholders for outputs and outcomes which they are accountable for and to report on performance in a manner that clients and stakeholders can easily comprehend The indicators used for the scorecard is a subset of indicators from the Performance Indicator Framework (PIF). Scorecards for major stakeholders include: (a) LGUs; (b) DOHs Centers for Health Development; (c) DOH Hospitals; (d) DOH Central Ofﬁce; and (e) Donors. 

1. LGU Scorecard 

The LGU Scorecard is a composite scorecard of stakeholders- within the province-wide healthsystem (PWH'). These include the clients, the public and private providers within the component municipalities, cities and provinces, and the municipal, city and provincial government. The local governments as stewards of the local health system is accountable for each of their local health systems. 

2. CHD Scorecard 

The CHD Scorecard reflects the performance of the Center for Health DeveIOpment as extenSIon producers of the DOH Central Office in its- mandate and function of steering and leading the national health system. Performance indicators include the quantity and quality of goods and services desired by the local health systems in the regional coverage area, and prescribed by the DDH management along the 4 main strategies of F1. Performance indicators also include indicators on satisfaction of clients with the CHD services and products. 

3. DOH Hospital Scorecard 

The DOH Hospital Scorecard reflects the performance of the DOH Hospitals in the execution of their mandates, on health outcomes expected of hospitals and the production of goods and services desired by their clients. Performance indicators include the extent of achievement of key interventions of F1 referrable to DOH Hospitals and included In the Performance Based Budgets for DOH Hospitals 

4. DOH central Office Scorecard 

The DOH Central Office Scorecard reflects performance of the Policy and Standards Development Office for Service Delivery, Regulation and Finance, the Sectoral Management Support Off co and the Internal Management Support Off ce Performance indicators include the extent of achievement of national Implementation elements of key Intewentions of F1 referrabie to each Office. 

5. Donor Scorecard 

The Donors become stakeholders when they commit Specific support to F1 Such support may be in the form of! program assistance, site- speciﬁc assistance F1 pillar assistance or agency-woe assistance. Donor assistance shall be evaluated on the basis of health system ﬁnal and intermediate outcomes it contributes to, the extent of assistance to F1 and Sector Development Approach for Health, and will be monitored on the basis of F1 policy levers (major final outputs, inputs, structures and processes) the assistance produces. 

C. Data System

1. The sources of data for indicators on outputs and Outcomes are from existing and institutional data Sources such as FHSIS, NDHS Health Accounts, etc. Additional data sources shall be established as needed Population or Household Surveys Facility Surveys, Evaluation and Special Studies shall also be utilized. 

2. A baseline study shall be conducted on the identified indicators for the different scorecards. The baseline study shall provide information on (a) status of performance of the health system; (b) areas of the MES that needs to be improved or revised; (c) targets that needs to be revised or set; and (d) assess the strengths and weaknesses of the data sources and the ouaiity of its findings. An evaluation study shall be conducted in 2011 

3. The Local Health lnfonnation System shall be utilized to collate existing data sources the MES repon and the data collected forthe LGU Scorecard. 

4. Regular Conferences shall be c-onducted by different stakeholders for the different scorecards to report on monitoring data and to discuss progress 
a) Annual Conference at. the National level for all F1 sites; 
b) Semi Annual Conference at the Regional level for all F1 sites for each region, and 
c) Quarterly Conference for all PHO‘s and MH‘O"s in the Province-Wide Health System (PWHS).
