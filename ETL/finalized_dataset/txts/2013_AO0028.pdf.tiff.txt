<body>
	

 
I. RATIONALE: 

Vector-home diseases are infectious diseases that are transmitted by organisms that include insects, snails and rodents. Some of the most debilitating of these diseases we have in the Philippines are malaria, dengue, lymphatic ﬁlariasis and schistosomiasis and Japanese B encephalitis. Lymphatic ﬁlariasis can cause morbidity for life and dengue causes the highest mortality among young children. Communities are commonly at risk for more than one vector- bome disease. 		

Distribution of vector-borne diseases follows the geographical distribution of the vector. There are vectors that can transmit more than one vector-borne disease, like Anopheles ﬂavirostris can transmit both malaria and ﬁlariasis. There are areas where vector-home diseases co-exist because both vectors are present in the area such as dengue and ﬁlariasis, as well as dengue and malaria; malaria and ﬁlariasis. 

Disease prevention through vector control is an important component of disease control. It can reduce or interrupt disease transmission, because without the host—vector contact, these diseases cannot thrive. Vectors have usually been controlled by environmental management or modifying breeding sites. Attention shifted towards the use of insecticides by 19503, notably  indoor residual spraying. Pyrethroids are the most commonly used insecticide group for public health and the only group for treating mosquito nets. A number of non-chemical methods are available to suppress vector population and contribute to vector-home disease control especially when used in combination with insecticidal methods. 

Most vector-borne disease control programs focus on a single disease. Vector control implemented is conﬁned to the health sector and they depend on the use of chemical application as the only intervention in most cases. There are opportunities for controlling several diseases that occur inthe same area, thus resulting in greater efﬁciency and cost saving for vector control. 

Today, a new generation of vector control program is needed which should integrate W chemical and non—chemical interventions. They also have to be adapted to the requirements imposed by the health sector reforms with a dynamic inter-sectoral collaboration. Other sectors and communities are often not aware that the risk of vector-borne disease is partly or largely determined in their domestic sphere of inﬂuence and thus they could contribute to vector control and personal protection. 

 
This guideline shall provide guidance to managers of vector control programs and others involved in setting policy to support IVM, as IVM requires interdisciplinary collaboration for the health sector and other public sectors and stakeholders. 

II. OBJECTIVE: 

This Order shall set the guidelines in the adoption of an Integrated Vector Management to 

support vector-home disease prevention and control program through vector control. 

III. SCOPE AND COVERAGE: 

This Order shall apply to all health workers in the national, regional, provincial, municipal 

and city health ofﬁces whose functions and activities contribute to support the adoption of integrated vector management in all areas endemic for malaria, dengue and ﬁlariasis and to all National Government Agencies, Environmental Management Bureau (EMB), Department of Agriculture, Local Government Units (LGUs), Public and Private Health Facilities, Non- Government Organizations (N GOs) whose functions and activities contribute to the adoption of IVM to support disease prevention through vector control. 

IV. DEFINITION OF TERMS:  

Vector is any organism responsible for the transmissionof the diseases from one person to another by inoculation into the skin or mucous membrane by biting; or by deposit of infective materials on the skin or food or by biological reproduction Within the organism such as Anopheles species for malaria, Aedes, Mansonia and Culex species for ﬁlariasis and Aedes species for dengue. 

Vermin is a group of insects or small animals such as ﬂies, mosquitoes, cockroaches, ﬂeas, lice, bedbugs, mice, rats and others which are vectors of diseases. 

Vector control is measures directed against the vector of diseases. 

Vector-borne diseases (VBD) are infectious diseases where part of its life cycle is completed within the vector. 

Filariasis is a disease caused by a worm Wuchererza bancrofti. 

Biological control is a vector control method which utilizes predators, parasites and natural enemies of vector species to reduce or eliminate the vector population. 

Chemical control is a vector method which utilizes insecticides, pesticides or rodenticide to kill the larval or adult stage of the vector. 

Mechanical control is a pest control method which utilizes mechanical devices like rodent traps; ﬂy traps, mosquito traps, air curtain, window screens and ultra-violet lights to reduce the pest population. 

Environmental management is a method which seeks to change the environment to prevent or reduce vector propagation and human contact with the pathogen by destroying or altering the environment. 

Insecticides are chemicals used to kill insects. 

Larvicides are chemicals used to kill the larval stages of the vector. 

Rodenticides are chemicals used to destroy rats. 




m: Sanitation Inspector is a government ofﬁcer employed by the national, provincial, city or municipal government, who enforces sanitary rules, laws and regulations and implements environmental sanitation activities under the supervision of the provincial/municipal/city health ofﬁcer/ sanitary engineer. 

n. Urban Pest Control Applicator is any individual who uses or supervisees the use of pesticides or any methods or services for urban pest control or implementation of vermin abatement program. 

o. Integrated vector management is a rational decision-making process to optimize the use of resources for vector control. IVM aims to improve the efﬁcacy, cost-effectiveness, ecological soundness and sustainability of vector control. It is based on evidence and integrated management, promoting the use of a range of interventions — alone or in combination — selected on the basis of local knowledge about the vectors, disease and disease determinants. IVM approach addresses several diseases concurrently, because some vectors can transmit several diseases and some interventions are effective against several vectors. 

V. GENERAL GUIDELINES: 

A. The concept of IVM builds on selected vector control which was deﬁned by the WHO Expert Committee on Malaria as the targeted use of different vector control, alone or in combination to prevent or reduce human-vector contact cost-effectively, while addressing sustainability issues (WHO, 1997). 

B. In 2004, the WHO adopted the Global Strategic Framework on Integrated Vector Management as a ﬁrst step towards implementation of new approach to vector control. 

C. IVM shall be guided by the following principles: 

1. Evidence—based decision-making = decision—making based on evidence of the local and contemporary conditions of diseases and disease transmission; 

2. Adopting a multi-disease approach = taking into account all prevalent vector-borne diseases within one strategy of vector control; 

3. Combining vector control interventions = taking into account all relevant vector control methods to make use of supplementary effects, while using chemical insecticides selectively and judiciously; 

4. Involving other sectors and communities = other divisions of health, other sectors and communities playing a major role in vector control and personal protection; and 

5. Community empowerment = planning and implementation and evaluation of vector control at the most localized level. Local representatives will know better the needs of their citizens (WHO, 2010) 

D. Vector control shall be strengthened by making it increasingly based on local evidence, by integrating several interventions where appropriate and by collaborating with divisions within W the health sector and with other sectors while actively engaging communities. 

E. Implementing Rules and Regulations of Chapter XVI- Vermin Control of the Code on Sanitation the Philippines (PD 856) stipulates in Section 7, 7.1-4 that vermin abatement program must be basically between the private and the government sector. Also in Section 7.2.1-6 that a vermin abate program shall include any or combination of environmental sanitation control, naturalistic control, biological and genetic control, mechanical and physical control, chemical control and integrated control. In Section 8, 8.1-12 stipulates control measures and methods for insects. ' 

F. Vector control activities do not constitute individual program, but are components of integrated disease control programs.

G. Vector control interventions shall be undertaken with the view of preventing, reducing or interrupting disease transmission.

H. Vector control interventions shall be based on a sound knowledge of ecological and epidemiological situations, cost-effectiveness analysis and judicious integration of the available options. 

I. Vector control shall be evidenced-based, sustainable, environmentally sound, economically feasible and socially acceptable. 

J. Integrated vector management encourages effective collaboration within the health sector and with other sectors and the empowerment of communities, shall therefore be the basis for the implementation of vector control in the Philippines. 

VI. SPECIFIC GUIDELINES: 

A. IVM approach shall address several diseases concomitantly, because one vector can transmit several diseases and some interventions are effective against several vectors. IVM is based on a solid understanding of the inter-relationship between the vector, the environment and humans which leads to the selection and deployment of the management cost-effective and sustainable intervention, either individually or combined to achieve the maximum possible reduction or local elimination of the disease. 

B. IVM strategy shall consider the following elements (WHO 2008):

a. Advocacy, social mobilization and legislation — promotion and integration of the principles of IVM into the development policies of all relevant agencies, organization and civil society; establishment or strengthening of regulatory and legislative controls for public health; empowerment of communities, etc. 

b. Collaboration within the health sector and with other sectors- consideration of all options within and between public and private sectors; application of the principles of subsidiary in that it promotes planning, implementation and evaluation of vector control at the most localized level; strengthening all channels of communication among policy—makers, managers of vector-home diseases program and other IVM partners. 

c. Integrated approach — ensuring rational use of available resources by controlling several diseases concurrently; combination of non-chemical and chemical methods; integration with other disease control initiatives. 

d. Evidenced—based decision-making —adoption of strategies and intervention to local ecology, epidemiology and resources, guided by operational research and subject to routine monitoring and evaluation. 

e. Capacity-building —- development of necessary physical infrastructure, ﬁnancial resources and human resources of national and local levels to manage IVM. 

C. IVM shall insure regular monitoring of susceptibility to pesticides of vectors and pests of public health importance. Training and capacity building on judicious use of public health pesticides shall be an integral part of vector-borne disease control programs. 

D. In the planning of IVM, decision shall be made on the type of intervention methods, targeting and timing of interventions, management of resources and stakeholder participation. Make available, accurate and valid information on the main diseases and vectors aimed at section of the population to be targeted; vector control options available; ﬁnancial and human resources; local health services and partners’ contributions and participation of the community. This shall include the following steps: 

1. Epidemiological assessment to determine the incidence and prevalence of vector-borne- diseases. Reliable and current data on disease incidence, prevalence and mortality. Overlay mapping to identify where two or more diseases co-exist. 

2. Stratify/classify geographic areas according to burden of the Vector-Borne Diseases (V BD) to set priorities for allocation of resources to areas where they are most needed. Differentiate provinces according to levels of endemicity. 

3. Conduct vector surveillance of vectors of all vector-bome diseases; to know the vector species and characteristics per stratiﬁed areas, vector breeding sites, behavior, seasonality and susceptibility to insecticides.


4. Analyze the local system to ascertain the determinants of the disease and their changes in time and space. Parasite-related (parasites causing the disease; drug resistance), vector- related (resting, feeding, breeding preferences of the vector); human-related (population groups, movement, local practices and attitudes, access to health care, economic situation; environment-related (rainfall pattern, land-use, local ecosystem). 


5. Review available vector control measures and make an optimal selection of methods. 

The following are vector control methods and their applicability to vector— borne disease:

6. Assess the needs and outline available human and ﬁnancial resources. These shall include: 

a. Inventory of resources and organizational structure with participation of local stakeholders. 

b. Coordinate services with locally on— going programs or government services. Potential resources received from VBD control programs, local government units and other sectors (agriculture for vectors breeding in irrigated agriculture; for vectors breeding in peri-domestic environment demand community participation in removal of breeding sites). Also, the selected method has implication for the type of resources, like IRS requires trained spraying teams under proper supervision with ﬁnancial and logistic support. 

c. Capacity strengthening of community members and health workers, agricultural extension workers on vector biology and vector control methods. 

7. Develop an IVM strategy 

a. When to implement - Environmental management could be at the onset of rainy season when new breeding habitat is created leading to increased transmission; or in the dry season when breeding sites are limited and vector are most vulnerable to control measures. IRS shall be applied before the onset of rainy season; LLIN does not need speciﬁc timing because of its long lasting effect but distribution shall be before the peak of transmission which follows one month after the rainy season, advocacy shall be carried out before the rainy season. 

Source reduction against Aedes requires frequent activities; larviciding with chemical or biological products lasts only a few week; frequency of IRS and treatment of conventional nets is every six months. 

b. Where to implement — Source reduction (removal of outdoor breeding containers of Aedes mosquitoes) in and around residential areas; ITNs and LLINs to all endemic areas. 

Every port or ai1ports shall be kept free from vector of diseases of epidemiological signiﬁcance; disinfecting public utility vehicles prior to departure to prevent migration of vermin/vectors with epidemiological signiﬁcance. 

c. Vectors targeted — Which vector species are targeted; some interventions are effective against several vector species; Anopheles ﬂavirostris/mangyanus/litorals/balabacensis are . vectors of malaria; Aedes poicilius, Mansonia bonneae/uniformis/Culex quinquefasciatus for LP; Aedes aegzpti/albopictus for dengue. 

d. Role in implementation ~— Promotion, creation of awareness and distribution of LLIN/ITNs shall involve the municipal health ofﬁces, barangay health workers. 

The Sanitation Inspectors as stipulated in the IRR of Vermin Control of the Code on Sanitation of the Philippines (PD 856) are mandated to conduct control measures against insects to include 1) larviciding and other biological control methods by destruction of adult insects by fogging, misting, residual spraying, dusting, poisoning, trapping and swatting; 2) warding off and repelling adult insects by using botanicals, electrical and biological methods; 3) covering, screening (mosquito net gauge no. 16 wire mesh) of all water stock container; 4) changing of water in ﬂower vases every 3 three days; and 5) preventing the accumulation of water in containers such as tin cans, tin boxes, broken or empty bottles, old tires, etc. 

The quarantine ofﬁcer or the local health ofﬁcer from each port and airport shall take practicable measures to help port and airport installations ﬁne of vermin (PD 856). 

The community or the barangay health workers shall be tapped for source reduction; local spraying team for IRS; environmental management (stream clearing) shall be a community participated activity. 

e. Responsibility- Interventions such as IRS demand logistic support from the health sector (Centers for Health Development, Provincial Health Ofﬁce); environmental interventions shall be managed by the Department of Agriculture, Environment Management Bureau and the Local Government Units for management of logistic and human resources. 

A functional organizational structure which may be in the form of committee or task force on IVM at the municipal level shall be established for effective coordination of activities with participation of stakeholders including the community. 

f. External monitoring and evaluation — Local partners shall monitor and evaluate the implementation of their activities to identify shortcomings and suggest remedial measures. Monitoring and evaluation is not conducted by the entity responsible for implementation but by external partner to ensure unbiased results. 

E. Vector control interventions shall be planned within speciﬁc disease control program involving all stakeholders. Entomologists, epidemiologists and environmentalists shall work with the program manager to determine appropriate vector control intervention to be implemented by the LGUs against a single vector-borne disease or against two vector-bome diseases coexisting in a particular area. Guidelines for monitoring and evaluation of IVM (WHO 2012 (1) could be utilized for harmonization. 

F. Members of the barangay council, household heads, mothers and young adults shall be requested to attend/participate in planning of vector control interventions. Their roles shall be deﬁned by the program manager (Regional Directors, Regional Coordinators of VBD, PHOs, MHOs, CHOs) requesting for their commitment. They shall be urged to form speciﬁc groups (barangay council, household heads, and mothers, young adults) to assist/ facilitate implementation of VC interventions; Household heads to assist IRS operations; mothers in distribution of nets and advocacy on the regular use of nets and young adults in dengue vector surveillance. 

G. Collaboration among infrastructure projects; irrigation, dams, road construction, developmental projects shall be established between the program managers and project implementers. Vector control services shall work closely with sectors of Departments of Public works and Highways, Agriculture, Education, Environment and Quarantine to harmonize approaches towards IVM strategy of vector control. 

H. Vector control services at the provincial, municipal and city health ofﬁces shall be strengthened/re—organized for an effective implementation of IVM. 

1. Pre-service/refresher training of spraymen shall be conducted by the regional/provincial staff. Sanitary Engineers shall be oriented on the conduct of spraying operations; and Sanitation Inspectors shall be trained to assist in spraying operations; to become certiﬁed pesticide applicators (fogging machine operators) or supervised during the conduct of fogging operations.
