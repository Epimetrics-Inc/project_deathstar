<subject>SUBJECT: Guidelines for the Nationwide Implementation of Dengue Rapid Diagnostic Test (RDT)</subject>


<body>
I. RATIONALE 

The Philippines ranked ﬁrst in the Western Paciﬁc Region among countries with most number of dengue cases from 2013 to 2015. A total of 200,415 suspected dengue cases and 598 deaths were reported nationwide in 2015. There is no speciﬁc medicine against dengue and treatment for dengue involves supportive measures such as ﬂuid management and monitoring of warning signs. Early detection and prompt management are very critical. Mortality rate is reduced to &lt 1% as compared to 20% death rate if proper management is initiated early (WHO, 2016). 

The introduction of the Rapid Diagnostic Test (RDT) for Dengue Non-Structural protein 1 (N Sl) antigen, Complements the overarching 48 Strategy of the National Dengue Prevention and Control Program speciﬁcally in seeking early consultation. The 48 Strategy includes: Search and Destroy, Seek Early Consultation, Self-Protection Measures and Saying Yes to fogging when there is an impeding outbreak. Through the Dengue NSl RDT, test results are produced Within the day making early detection, prompt treatment and timely referral possible. 

The early recognition of dengue through clinical examination, complemented with a simple and rapid diagnostic tool is the cornerstone of its early diagnosis. Hence, the introduction and adoption of Dengue NSl RDT by the National Dengue Prevention and Control Program shall upgrade our existing facilities at the point-of—care and strengthen the diagnosis and management capabilities of our Rural Health Units. 

II. OBJECTIVE 

This issuance shall provide technical and procedural guidelines on the nationwide implementation of Rapid Diagnostic Test at the Rural Health Units (RHUs) and other point of care. 

III. SCOPE 

This issuance shall apply to the DOH - Central Ofﬁce, Regional Ofﬁces, DOH — ARMM, Philippine Health Insurance Corporation and Rural Health Units. 

IV. DEFINITION OF TERMS: 

1. Rapid Diagnostic Test (RDT) — a collection of reagents and other materials for in vitro diagnostics, intended to be used for the detection of either antigen or antibody from clinical samples, usually blood, within a shorter period. 

2. Dengue Non-Structural protein 1 (N S1) RDT- is an immuno-ehromatography based test used to detect the Dengue virus non-structural protein 1 antigen in human serum, plasma, or whole blood to suggest acute Dengue infection. 

3. Suspected Dengue Case- a person with an acute febrile illness of 2—7 days duration with 2 or more of the following: headache, body malaise, retro-orbital pain, myalgia, arthralgia, anorexia, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, ﬂushed skin, rash (petechial, Hermann’s sign). (Refer to PIDSR Manual of Procedures, 3rd Edition 2014). 

4. Probable Dengue Case-4": a suspected-*case and with a laboratory test result of at least CBC with -'*leueopenia withor. without thrombocytopenia and/or a positive Dengue NSl antigen test or dengue lgM antibody test. (Refer to PIDSR Manual of Procedures, 3rd Edition 2014). 

5. Conﬁrmed Dengue Case— a suspected case with positive result for viral culture isolation, and/or Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR). (Refer to PIDSR Manual of Procedures, 3rd Edition 2014). 

V. GENERAL GUIDELINES  

1. Aligned with the Dengue Program 48 strategy of “Seeking Early Consultation”, a suspected dengue case shall be eligible for Dengue NS] RDT test if the signs and/or symptoms manifest between day one and day ﬁve of the illness. THE DENGUE NSl RDT SHALL NOT BE USED TO A PATIENT BEYOND FIVE DAYS OF ILLNESS. 

2. Dengue NSI RDT shall be used in support for the clinical diagnosis of suspected dengue. However, it shall not be the sole basis for the ﬁnal diagnosis of dengue. (RT-PCR, Hemagglutination Inhibition test and virus isolation remain to be the “conﬁrmatory test” for the detection of dengue virus in human blood.) 

3. Dengue NSl RDT shall be performed by a health care worker, such as medical technologist, nurse, midwife, barangay health worker (BHW), and other health professional who has undergone appropriate training on its use. 

4. The performance of Dengue NSl RDT shall be supported by a quality assurance system. 

VI. SPECIFIC GUIDELINES 

A. Screening and Early Diagnosis of Patient 

1. An initial assessment of a suspected dengue case based on history of illness and physical examination shall be guided by A0 2012-0006: Revised Dengue Clinical Case Management Guidelines 2011 prior to using dengue NSl RDT. (Refer to Annex 1: Guide in the Initial Assessment of Suspected Dengue Case.) The Dengue NSl RDT shall only be performed to a patient who ﬁts the criteria of a SUSPECTED DENGUE CASE. 

2. Serum, plasma or whole blood specimen shall be used for Dengue NSl RDT. Capillary blood shall be used if the health facility has limited laboratory equipment or there is no medical technologist available to perform the venipuncture. 

3. A positive result shall be deﬁned as probable dengue case. However, a negative result does not rule out Dengue infection and therefore shall be correlated with the clinical information of the patient. The health provider shall rule out a window or convalescence period, wherein the virus may no longer be detected and antibody titer starts to rise. In this case, other laboratory tests may be performed. 

B. Performing the Test 

1. Specimen from the capillary blood may be obtained from a ﬁnger prick. (Refer to Annex 2: Methods for Collecting Specimen.) 

2. The dengue NSl RDT shall be performed and the result shall be made available during the time of consultation. It shall observe the same day testing and releasing of result. 


C. Recording and Reporting 

1. All positive results shall be recorded as PROBABLE DENGUE CASE, while negative cases shall be recorded as SUSPECTED DENGUE CASE and shall be reported using the PIDSR Case Report Form (CRF) (Refer to Annex 4). Those with invalid interpretation after the second test shall still be recorded as SUSPECTED DENGUE CASE. 

2. For interpretation of invalid results, the test shall be repeated on the same day when the ﬁrst test is done. The result of the second test shall be used as basis of the ﬁnal interpretation. Two invalid results shall still be classiﬁed as SUSPECTED DENGUE CASE and shall be managed accordingly. 

3. The frequency for reporting shall follow the PIDSR reporting system. 

D. Quality Assurance Program 

1. Lot Testing 

a. Pre-shipment lot testing: RITM shall subject ﬁfteen percent (15%) of RDT kits to evaluation prior to shipment to health facilities. 

b. Post-shipment lot testing: RITM shall evaluate the RDT kits sent to three selected health facilities and then returned to RITM. 

c. Report of the pre-shipment and post shipment testing shall be available after 2 weeks of receipt of the RDT kits. 

2. External Quality Assurance 

a. RITM shall conduct a proﬁciency testing to health facilities at least every two years. 

b. Health facility passing the EQA shall receive a certiﬁcate valid for 2 years. 

c. Health facility that will not pass the EQA shall subject to onsite assessment, retraining, and close monitoring of performance until all recommendations are satisfactorily met. 

3. Validation 

a. RITM and DPCB shall select 50 health facilities to send samples for validation. 

b. Selected health facility shall store one sample per week collected from the agreed day and shall be sent to RITM on a quarterly basis. 

c. RITM shall perform testing of these samples.
