<body>
I. RATIONALE: 

The State has a duty to promote and protectthe right of health of the people and instill health consciousness among them (Section 15, Article II, 1987 Constitution). The State shall also establish and maintain an effective food and drug regulatory system and undertake appropriate health, human resource development, and research, responsive to the country’s health need and problems (Section 12, Article XIII, 1987 Constitution). 

Thus, Republic Act No. 3720, as amended by Executive Order No. 175 series of 1987, otherwise known as the “Food, Drug and Devices and Cosmetics Act” establishes an effective system in the registration, monitoring and regulation of processed foods, drugs, medical devices and cosmetic products to protect the health of the people. 

Seetion 21 of RA 3720 provides that full reports of investigations which have been made to show whether or not such drug is safe, efficacious and of good quality for use based on clinical studies conducted in the Philippines shall be submitted to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), aka BFAD; 

Republic Act No. 7394, otherwise known as the “Consumer Act of the Philippines,” declares that it is the policy of the State to promote the interest and general welfare of the consumer by implementing measures for: 1. protection against hazards to health and safety; 2. protection against deceptive, unfair and unconscionable sales acts and practices; 3.provision of information and education to facilitate "decision making in choosing the products and exercise of rights of consumers. 

Pharmacovigilance is deﬁned by the World Health Organization in 2006 as “the science and activities relating to the detection, assessment, understanding and prevention of adverse effects or any other possible drug— related problems,” WHO 2006. The deﬁnition of the World Health Organization includes the investigational substances used in the clinical trial studies. Thus, pharmacovigilance is therefore one of the important tools in pre-marketing/ pre-clinical monitoring of adverse drug effects/ reactions and post-marketing surveillance by ensuring the safety of pharmaceutical and related health products. 

The FDA undertook several initiatives for pharmacovigilance, amongst which are: Memorandum Circular No. 5 s 1994 which directed the industry to submit adverse reports on their products to FDA and Department Order No. 345-1 June 1994, creating the National Adverse Drug Reaction Committee (NADRAC) which assisted FDA in the technical evaluation of adverse reports and recommends the course of action needed to ensure the safety of pharmaceutical products. 

In August 1994, the ADR Monitoring Program started as an Aus Aid project of the National Drug Policy Program (NDP) and was formally recognized by the WHO as a National Monitoring Center. Thus, it included the Philippines as the 42nd member in February 1995. 

Bureau Circular No. 01 series of 2002 required applications to be notarized and to submit Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) for handling adverse reaction reports which further adds credibility to the applications for registration of products, to FDA. 

In October 2002, the ADR unit was transferred to the Product Services Division from the Regulation Division I which continues to receive and acknowledge reports from the industry. 

With a strong inﬂux of products such as food supplements, medical devices, local and foreign pharmaceutical products and cosmetics and the foreign safety alerts and product reports, it is crucial to provide a legal basis for institutionalizing a National Pharmacovigilance Program that would meet the demands of the country in ensuring the health and welfare of the Filipinos in terms of pre-clinical and post-marketing surveillance.
