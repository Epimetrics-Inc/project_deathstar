<subject>SUBJECT: Implementing Rules and Regulations of Republic Act No. 8243 Otherwise Known as The Traditional and Alternative Medicine Act of 1997</subject>

<body>

Enclosed for information and guidance, is a copy of the Rules and Regulations to implement Republic Act No. 8423 otherwise known as the Traditional and Alternative Medicine Act of 1997. As of January 3, 2000, this IRR has already been in effect. PITACH is now considered as an attached agency of the Department of Health whose management is now the responsibility of a so-called Board of Trustees, members of which are Malacañang appointed sectoral representatives and officials from other government agencies. This Board is headed by the Secretary of Health who acts as the ex-officio Chairman of the Board of Trustees.

As an additional information, PTAHC is a government corporation whose financial operations are dictated upon by the Government Corporation Code of the Philippines. Based on a DBM Circular issued last year, all government corporations have to prove financial viability by 2005 or be included in the list of assets to be liquidated or privatised by government. The Department of Budget and Management as well as the Commission on Audit have advised PITACH to immediately account for product inventories, production equipment, real properties, financial statements and balances as well as work out the transfer of plantilla items and their corresponding salaries and other benefits in preparation for a completely separate CY 2001 PITACH budget.

The Office of the Secretary has also directed the Finance Service to assist PITAHC in transferring the FY 2000 Budget allotted to the Traditional Medicine Program to PITAHC’s Corporate Account so it may undertake the necessary transitional activities, e.g. planning, workshops, consultative meetings to address organization problems and issues it is now encountering. Likewise, the Regional Health Offices (RHOs) are directed to transfer the budget to the Herbal Pharmaceutical and Processing Plants (HPPPs).

To ensure the proper implementation of the said law, the Regional Directors from Regions II, VI, XI and XII are hereby encouraged to heed advisories issued by the Philippine Institute of Traditional and Alternative Health Care (PITAHC). These advisories are meant to guide the Regional Directors concerned as they transfer their responsibility and jurisdiction over the assets, personnel and facilities of the Herbal Pharmaceutical and Processing Plant to PITAHC as mandated under Section 17 of Republic Act No. 8423. The full cooperation of all concerned is vial to the viability of PITAHC as a DOH Corporation.

Please be guided accordingly.
