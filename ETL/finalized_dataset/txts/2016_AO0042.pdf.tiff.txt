Preferably, the Business Ofﬁce Shall be provided with transaction counters designed in such manner that the counter heights Shall not only accommodate normal transactions (inquiries and payments by patient’s companions and relatives) but also to allow visual access and communication between patients on wheelchair and Staff from the Business Office. 

2.2 The Toilet Facility for patients and visitors may be located near the Waiting Area for easy access especially for patient on wheelchair. 

2.3 The Staff Pantry or Break Room may be Situated near the Dialysis Service Complex but not inside the HD Treatment Room in order to maintain privacy of patients undergoing treatment. 

On the other hand, the Staff Locker and Dressing Room Shall be preferably located in such manner as to prepare first the HD Treatment Staff particularly for changing from street clothes into appropriate attire before entering the HD Treatment Room, improving Infection Control measures. 

2.4 In order to ensure further privacy for HD patients undergoing treatment and to maintain cleanliness for the HD Treatment Room, a ‘control door’ (with a widthlopening that can easily accommodate a wheelchair or stretcher) Shall be provided between the Reception Area/Section and the Dialysis Service Complex).

In addition, the Water Treatment Room shall be made presentable with floors finished preferably with ceramic tiles or approved equivalent and walls also tiled or painted. Further, it shall be well-ventilated and provided with exhaust fan/s. 

2.9 Likewise, the Waste Holding Cubicle/Area, Soiled Linen Cubicle/Area and Janitor’s Closet Shall be planned in such manner that they are accessible from the HD Treatment Section but at the same time ‘zoned’ for visual concealment purposes. 

2.10 The required emergency generator set room shall also be located preferably ‘zoned’ from the rest of the dialysis clinic especially from the HD Treatment Section in order to avoid noise disturbance to HD patients as well as to ensure restricted access. Moreover, the emergency generator set room, when warranted, shall have acoustical insulation or sound absorbing material along walls to diffuse, lessen, if not totally eliminate the noise disturbance of the genset when in operation. In addition, room for the emergency generator set Shall have Space for maintenance access and Shall be provided with appropriate ventilation for cooling and elimination of fumes.

5.0 Space Planning Considerations: 

5.1 The Reception and Registration Office (or Business Office) shall be located in such manner as it will be afforded of visual control of the main entry to the Medical Facility. The office layout, transaction windows and counters of the said room shall allow the receptionist and other office staff to see and acknowledge incoming OFW clients and at the same time facilitate their transaction activities. 

5.2 The Waiting Area shall be planned in such a way that it is easily accessible from the main entry and located adjacent to the Reception and Registration Office. Furthermore, the Waiting Area shall have a pleasing environment for the OFW clients preferably a homelike and restful one. Also, the Waiting Area shall be adequately spaced and provided with appropriate furniture. If it is possible, the room shall permit a view of the outside such as of those found in nature like flowering plants, trees or distance and if not, an interesting view of people and activity (as can be made possible in a shopping mall or street fagade location) will serve as a second choice. 

5.3 The space components of the Administrative Service namely the Office of the Medical Director, Reception and Registration Office or Business Office, Medical Records and Waiting Area shall be planned contiguous to one another as they are closely related in terms of function. Thus, easy accessibility between these administrative areas is highly recommended. 

5.4 The Laboratory Section provided with Specimen Collection Room/area and Medical X—Ray Facility shall also be planned contiguous or adjacent to one another as they compose the ‘Ancillary Zone' of the Medical Facility. Appropriate waiting areas for these rooms shall be provided. 

5.5 Space or room components of the Clinical Service may be clustered with a common waiting area or sub waiting area/s or even perhaps situated along a waiting corridor planned in accordance to the procedural arrangements that may be set by the management of the Medical Facility. 

5.6 Lastly, support service room components shall be planned in such a way that they are accessible to both clients and staff but concealed from direct view or “zoned away’ from the rest of the major areas of the Medical Facility for aesthetic purposes. These rooms may be clustered in a service zone or perhaps located at corridor ends.
