I. BACKGROUND/RATIONALE 

In July 4, 1946, the Quarantine Service was formally turned over to the Philippine Government from the United States Public Health Services. The following year, Republic Act No. 123 “An Act Prescribing the Reorganization and Operation of the Bureau of Quarantine Service and Promulgating Regulations Thereof” was approved on July 14, 1947. (Bureau of Quarantine Documents) 

At the global scene, the International Sanitary Regulation (ISR) by the World Health Organization to which the Philippines is a signatory was adopted by the Fourth World Assembly in 1951. (Quarantine Regulations of 1955, International Health Regulations, 2005) 

In 1969, the ISR was renamed the International Health Regulation or Regulations. The 1969 Regulations were later amended in 1973 and 1981 respectively. (International Health Regulation, 2005, Bureau of Quarantine Documents) 

Due to the above developments, the Quarantine Regulations to implement Republic Act 123 or the Quarantine Law was revised. The directive was issued through Administrative Order No. llS-C, entitled “Revised Quarantine Rules and Regulations”, dated March 6, 1992. 

In 2004, the dynamic changes occurring worldwide concerning diseases of international concern prompted the government to ratify Republic Act 9271, “ An Act Strengthening the Regulatory Capacity of the Department of Health in Quarantine and International Health Surveillance, Repealing for the Purpose RA No. 123 of 1947”. In line with this, the Implementing Rules and Regulations (IRR) of the said Republic Act were promulgated. The [RR was issued through Administrative Order No. 186, series of 2004. 

On the other hand, the F orty-eight World Health Assembly in 1995 called for a substantial revision of the [HR which was adopted in 1969. And, in 2005 the Fifty—eight World Health Assembly adopted the 2005 International Health Regulation. (International Health Regulation, 2005) 

With these developments and in consideration of the increase in international travel and trade, and the emergence and re-emergence of international disease threats and other public health risks, there is a need to update the current Implementing Rules and Regulations of RA 9271 otherwise known as the Quarantine Act of 2004 in order to adapt to the revisions of the current IHR and the phenomenon of globalization. 

In line with the strategic thrusts and implementation framework of the Kalusugan Pangkalahatan (KP) or Universal Health Care (UHC) of the Department of Health, the revised Implementing Rules and Regulations will strengthen the overall performance of the Bureau 111 consonance with the mission and objectives of the department speciﬁcally at the Points of Entry (POE) 

II. OBJECTIVES 

In order to ensure the provision of maximum security against the international spread of diseases with minimum interference to world trade and travel, the following objectives are formulated: 

A To deﬁne the standards and requisites for quarantine functions involving international and domestic operations; 

B. To outline measures to respond to public health emergencies of international concern through an effective entry-exit management at points of entry; 

C. To provide penalties for violations of RA 9271 in order to protect and promote the health of the public from health threats subject to the International Health Regulations; and 

D. To prescribe guidelines relative to the authority to utilize income per Section 9 of Republic Act 9271 to support various Quarantine operations in safeguarding public health at points of entry. 

III. SCOPE AND COVERAGE

The Bureau of Quarantine shall have the authority to issue quarantine certiﬁcates, bills of health, and/or other equivalent documents and formulates sanitation requirements over such conveyances, wharfage, anchorage, airports and seaports for the proper enforcement of these Rules. 

Iv. IMPLEMENTING MECHANISM

PREFACE 

The Revised Implementing Rules and Regulations of Quarantine Act of 2004 (RA. 9271), serves as the updated version of the protocols in implementing surveillance and reSponse capabilities of the Bureau of Quarantine. This includes the implementation of the International Health Regulations (IHR) of 2005 of the World Health Organization (WHO) in which the country is committed to observe and implement as a member state. 

Parallel to the strategic thrusts and the implementation framework of the Kalusugan Pangkalahatan (KP) or Universal Health Care (UHC) as one of the advocacies of the Secretary of the Department of Health focusing on health strengthening implementation, ensuring the beneﬁts of health reforms, accessibility to quality health care and services for all Filipinos. This new regulation will strengthen the overall performance of the Bureau of Quarantine’s in consonance with the mission and objectives of the Department speciﬁcally at the Points of Entry (POE). 

Being the health authority at the Points of Entry (POE), the Bureau of Quarantine is mandated to ensure health security against the introduction and spread of infectious diseases to include the emerging and re-emerging diseases and public health emergencies of international concern. This encompasses the pro-active response to public health concerns on matters pertaining to food safety, sanitation and vector control in POE on conveyances, people, goods and cargoes. 

This will also respond comprehensively, rapidly and effectively to the epidemiological changes and continuing global trends which markedly have impact on disease surveillance, prevention and control. The promotion of these health regulations are balanced by an equal concern with the minimal interference on travel and trade and to meet the standards and requisites for quarantine operations involving both the international and domestic interests.
