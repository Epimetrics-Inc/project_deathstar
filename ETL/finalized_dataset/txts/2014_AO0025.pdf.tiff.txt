I. RATIONALE 

Executive Order 102 s. 1999, “Redirecting the Functions of the DOH”, mandates the Department of Health (DOH) to serve as the lead agency in ensuring equity, access, and quality of health care services. While the local government units (LGUs) have the primary mandate to ﬁnance and regulate the local health systems including the provision of Human Resources for Health (HRH) by virtue of sec. 16 and 17 of the Republic Act 7160, known as the “Local Government Code”, the DOH also recognizes that some LGUs have limited capacity to achieve recommended HRH to support universal health care, due to several factors including but not limited to geographical location, income class of the municipality, presence of armed conﬂict and certain provisions of national policies on personal services limitation. Hence, select cadre of HRH are being deployed by the DOH, in accordance with its ascribed roles and functions, to marginalized populations and other areas of need for the purpose of HRH complementation and health service delivery. Currently, the DOH deploys nurses, doctors, midwives, and other health professionals. Despite these endeavors, equity and access to critical health services remains inadequately addressed. 

Most of our HRH are primarily urban centered with 28% of them in the National Capital Region while other regions only have an average of 4% of the total HRH in health facilities. Autonomous Region of Muslim Mindanao has less than 1% share of these HRH (DOH NDHRHIS, June 2013). While there is no universal norm or standard for a minimum HRH density in any given country or region recommended by the World Health Organization, it was estimated that a density of fewer than 2.28 physicians, nurses and midwives per 1000 population generally fail to achieve a targeted 80% coverage rate for skilled birth attendance and child immunization (World Health Report, 2006). With the commitment to attain universal health care, HRH must be responsive to the needs of our country and support the achievement of our Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) targets. This would require the right quantity, quality and relevance of HRH to our health system needs. Therefore, there is a need to harmonize the policies and processes for the placement and distribution of health professionals through the deployment programs. 

In order to ensure the success of HRH as a strategy for universal health care, there is a need to create standard operational and administrative directions for all HRH deployed by DOH. 

This Order aims to provide the structure and mechanism for the deployment of HRH managed by DOH. 



II. OBJECTIVES 

A. General: 

To provide policies and guidelines for the implementation of HRH deployment programs for the purpose of improving access and health service delivery towards attainment of Universal Health Care. 

B. Speciﬁc: 

1. To provide guidelines for implementation of HRH deployment programs at the national and local levels of governance. 

2. To facilitate the implementation of HRH deployment by providing structure on the manner by which provinces and component LGUs and cities manage their local HRH. 

3. To provide a mechanism for program monitoring and evaluation. 

III. SCOPE 

This Order shall apply to the entire public health sector, DOH bureaus, Regional Offices, hospitals, DOH attached agencies, and local government units that are involved in the management of deployment of human resources for health. 

This Order shall cover the implementation of regular deployment programs of the different HRH including doctors, nurses, midwives, dentists, nutritionist dieticians, medical technologists, pharmacists, physical therapists, occupational therapists, and public health managers as needed. This involves the process of deployment from the pre-recruitment to program evaluation. It shall not cover deployment under case of nation emergencies and disasters or the movement of regular personal of the DOH by means of reassignment or tranfers.

This intends to unify existing guidelines for deployment of health professionals for the purpose of Improving access and health service delivery through the provision of HRH  

IV. OPERATIONAL DEFINITION OF TERMS 

A. Deployment— means by which select health professionals are physically transferred to areas of need to complement the existing HRH in health facilities and for effective and efﬁcient health service delivery. 

B. Geographically isolated and disadvantaged area (GIDA)- communities with marginalized population, physically and socio-economically separated from the mainstream society such as island municipalities, up—land communities, hard-to reach areas, and conﬂict-affected areas.

D. Human Resources for Health (HRH) - refers to health professionals currently engaged in actions Whose primary intent is to enhance health. They include physicians, nurses, midwives, dentists, and allied health professions with valid license/registration from the Professional Regulation Commission (PRC). They work in the different domains of the health system including curative, preventive and rehabilitative care services as well as health education, promotion and research. Under UHC, it is an instrument to ensure that all Filipinos have access to professional health care providers capable of meeting their health needs at the appropriate level of care. 

E. Indigenous cultural communities/indigenous peoples -as deﬁned in Republic Act No. 8371, otherwise known as "The Indigenous Peoples Rights Act of 1997". Also refer to indigenous peoples who have retained some or all of their own social, economic, cultural and political institutions, but may have been displaced from their traditional domains or who may have resettled outside their ancestral domains as deﬁned under DOH—NCIP-DILG Joint Memorandum Circular No. 2013-01 entitled “Guidelines on the Delivery of Basic Health Services for Indigenous Cultural Communities / Indigenous Peoples”.

H. Medical Pool Placement and Utilization Program (MPPUP)- is a program that deploys physicians as medical ofﬁcers or medical specialists to government hospitals to strengthen medical human resource for the delivery of quality health care responsive to the needs and priorities of the country. 

I. National Database of Human Resource for Health Information System (NDHRHIS)- is a DOH web-based repository of data on facility-based HRH. It aims to collect, store, process, and generate aggregate data on the demographic and employment information of health providers and provide up-to-date statistics on the supply and geographic distribution of health providers. 

J. Other Health Facilities- refer to smaller government facilities devoted to the promotion and maintenance of health. This includes primary care facilities (rural health centers, city health ofﬁces, BEMONC facilities/ birthing centers) managed by the local government units as deﬁned and classiﬁed under Administrative Order 2012-0012 known as “Rules and Regulations Governing the New Classiﬁcation of Hospitals and other Health Facilities in the Philippines”. 

K. Poor families— refers to families whose income fall below the poverty threshold as deﬁned by the National Economic and Development Authority and/or cannot afford in a sustained manner to provide their minimum basic needs of food, health, education, housing and other essential amenities of life.

I. DOH Regional Ofﬁces and other DOH health facilities shall endeavor to become effective instruments to inﬂuence local health systems through various means, such as but not limited to, establishment of referral systems and networks. 

J. There shall be coordinated and harmonized participation of stakeholders to include: academe, professional societies, non-government organizations for support to program implementation and evaluation.
