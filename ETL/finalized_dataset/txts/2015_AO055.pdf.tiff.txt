<subject>Subject: National Guidelines on the Management of Acute Malnutrition for Children under 5 years </subject>
<body>


I. BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE 

Despite the many gains in improving nutritional status of children under-5 in the Philippines, there remain persistent nutrition issues which impact their survival and long-term development. To address these issues, the Philippines in 2013 signed up to be part of the global Scaling-Up Nutrition (SUN) Movement, which unites governments, civil society, businesses and citizens in a worldwide effort to end under—nutrition. 

One pressing issue is acute malnutrition or “wasting”. According to the 2013 National Nutrition Survey of the Food and Nutrition Research Institute, wasting for children under ﬁve years has gradually increased from 6.9% in 2009 to 7.9% in 2013, which, as per World Health Organization’s public health problem threshold for global acute malnutrition, is considered poor. 

Wasting is the life-threatening form of malnutrition. If not properly treated with evidence-based interventions, children with severe acute malnutrition are 9.4 times more likely to die compared to normal children. Nutrition situation is threatened to worsen during times of emergencies when the risk of developing wasting is high. In recognition of this, SUN countries, including the Philippines, have identiﬁed the reduction of wasting in children as a key nutrition target for reduced child mortality and long-term development. The increasing national trend of wasting and the life-threatening nature of the condition make it a public health nutrition issue that needs to be urgently addressed in both development and emergency scenarios. 


Globally, acute malnutrition has been effectively managed in the last decade through an intervention called Integrated Management of Acute Malnutrition (IMAM). Death rates have been signiﬁcantly reduced to less than 10% (from as high as 30—50%) through a largely community-based programme using standardized medical and therapeutic care protocols. The intervention is recognized by UNICEF and WHO as the only established, evidence-based intervention which successfully addresses the problem of acute malnutrition and saves children’ s lives. It also falls into the category of “highly cost-effective” intervention in terms of Disability- Adjusted Life Years (DALYS) averted, a key measure of the cost-effectiveness of a public health intervention used by WHO. 


In the Philippines, IMAM has already been demonstrated for the past 5 years both in the emergency and non—emergency programs. A draft protocol has been contextualized and adopted by the IMAM Technical Working Group and aptly named it as the Philippine Integrated Management of Acute Malnutrition (PIMAM). It has used successfully in response to major emergencies such as Tropical Storm Sendong, Typhoons Pablo and Yolanda, Bohol earthquake, Zamboanga City Siege, and the prolonged armed conﬂict in Central Mindanao. In 2014 alone, almost 3,500 children with severe acute malnutrition (SAM) have received life-saving care in all emergency areas. Several municipalities and cities with high burdens of severe acute malnutrition have adopted this protocol through their rural health units. In particular, Davao City has included PIMAM into its regular nutrition programs and the city’s health workers are already I accustomed to the protocol, integrating it in the routine Integrated Management of Childhood Illnesses (IMCI) and Operation Timbang (OPT) Plus. 

This Order provides the policies and strategic framework to guide a multi-sectoral approach in the adoption and implementation of PIMAM.

V. DEFINITION OF TERMS 

1. Acute malnutrition (or Wasting and/or edema) — occurs when an individual suffers from current, severe nutritional restrictions, a recent bout of illness, inappropriate childcare practices or their combination resulting to sudden weight loss or the development of bilateral pitting edema. This can be reversed with appropriate treatment. 


a. Severe Acute Malnutrition (SAM) or Severe Wasting Very low weight-for—height deﬁned as less than 3 standard deviations below the median (&lt -3SD) of the WHO growth standards, characterized by visible severe wasting, or by the presence of bipedal. pitting edema (WHO), or a Mid-Upper Arm Circumference (MUAC) measurement of &lt 115 millimeters (&lt 11.50m). 

b. Moderate Acute Malnutrition (MAM) or Wasting Low weight-for—length/height deﬁned as between 2 and 3 SD below the median (&lt-2 and &gt= SD) of the WHO growth standards or a MUAC measurement of &lt 125mm and 2 115mm (&lt 12.50m and &gt= 11.50m). 

2. Appetite test — The most important criterion to decide if a patient shall be sent for in- or out-patient management. SAM cases 'with poor appetite indicates the presence of severe infection or major metabolic abnormality even in the absence of other signs, and shall be admitted for Inpatient Therapeutic Care. 

3. Mid-Upper Arm Circumference (MUAC) — MUAC is a measure of muscle wasting and has been shown to have the highest correlation with risk of mortality of any anthropometric indicator. It is also a simple and transparent measure and therefore the most appropriate for use in decentralized services. 

4. Ready—to-Use Food (RUF) — WHO recommended energy-dense, mineral and vitamin- enriched foods that deliver both macro and micronutrients and are ideally suited to the treatment of acute malnutrition in the community and at home. 

a. Ready-to-Use Therapeutic Food (RUTF) - an energy and nutrition-dense paste, containing 520-550 kcal/100g recommended by the WHO for the home-treatment of severe acute malnutrition. While RUTF must be consumed along with clean drinking water, no other foods besides breast milk are necessary for the rehabilitation of the severely malnourished child. 

b. Ready-to-Use Supplementary Food (RUSF) ——- types of RUF that are speciﬁcally designed either for the treatment-or prevention of MAM in children 6—59 months of age. It is eaten by the child in addition to breast milk and other family foods for about 3 months. It contains 534-543 kilocalories/ 100grams. 

5. Therapeutic Milk — a low protein formulation that delivers the right balance of macro and micronutrients recommended by the WHO for the treatment of severe acute malnutlition with complications in a health facility/hospital. Therapeutic milk is speciﬁcally formulatedfor management of SAM and is not equivalent to any commercial milk formula. _ 

a. F—75 Therapeutic Milk —— a type of therapeutic milk suited to stabilize the condition and restore normal metabolic function and nutrition-electrolyte balance of patients suffering from severe acute malnutrition while their medical complications are being I treated during phase 1 of treatment. 

b. F-100 Therapeutic Milk — a therapeutic milk formulation similar to RUTF for the recovery of patients suffering from severe acute malnutrition in- the nutritional rehabilitation phase of treatment (transition phase and phase 2). 

VI. GENERAL GUIDELINES

7. All implementing agencies shall develop, implement, and sustain information management systems and strategies to ensure that appropriate, timely and evidence-based information are available at all times and levels. Systems shall be put in place for making the information available and accessible in the case of disasters and emergencies. 

8. Coordinating, advocacy, networking, and partnership mechanisms shall be established and/or strengthened at all levels for effective and efﬁcient PIMAM service delivery during routine health programs and emergencies. 

9. The components of PIMAM shall be Community mobilization, Inpatient Therapeutic Care (ITC), Outpatient Therapeutic Care (OTC), and Targeted Supplementary Feeding (TSFP). These components shall sit within a multi-sectoral range of health and nutrition interventions and services which focus on tackling the determinants of undernutrition in the ‘critical 1000 day window’

VII. SPECIFIC GUIDELINES

B. Assessment and Diagnosis 

1. Acute malnutrition shall be diagnosed by assessing the child to be of inadequate weight relative to height based on the WHO Child Growth Standards and/or by identifying muscle wasting using Mid Upper Arm circumference (MUAC) and for bilateral pitting edema; 

2. Acute malnutrition shall be classiﬁed as moderate or severe according to the degree of wasting in comparison to speciﬁc cut-off points or reference standards. Children with bilateral pitting edema are always classiﬁed as having severe acute malnutrition. 

3. Assessment shall be made in the CPD of an Inpatient Therapeutic Care (ITC) facility or in an Outpatient Therapeutic Care (OTC) facility (BHS, BHC, or RHU). Other venues such as daycare centers shall also be used as the need arises. 

4. Once a child has been diagnosed with SAM, it is important to make sure that he or she shall be correctly assigned to outpatient or inpatient care based on his or her condition. This is based on whether the child has appetite (conduct Appetite Test using RUTF) and/or any medical complication based on IMCI criteria.

E. Referral and Management 

1. Inpatient Therapeutic Care (ITC) for infants and children shall focus primarily on the nutritional stabilization of the child and appropriate management of medical complications. Inpatient care shall be provided in order to: 

a. Recover infants &lt 6 months with SAM who require intensive treatment. 

b. Stabilize children with SAM aged 6 to 59 months who also have medical complications or a lack of demonstrated appetite sufﬁciently to allow them to continue their nutritional rehabilitation with OTC.  

c. Provide complete nutritional rehabilitation in inpatient care for children with SAM where there is no access to OTC. 

d. Children in outpatient care may also be referred to inpatient care for a period of more intensive treatment/monitoring when they are not responding appropriately to treatment as an outpatient. 

ITC has 3 distinct phases described below. Children aged less than 6 months shall be treated using speciﬁc protocols for this age group. 

a. Phase 1/Stabilization: Patients with an inadequate appetite and/or an acute major medical complication shall be initially admitted for stabilization treatment. F75 shall be used during this phase to stabilize and reverse physiological and metabolic abnormalities and correct electrolyte imbalances. There is no expectation for wasted children to gain weight during Phase 1. 

b. Transition Phase: This phase marks the transition from stabilization to OTC where these facilities exist, or to Phase 2 inpatient care when it is not possible to refer to OTC. Clinically, the return of appetite, and/or the improvement of clinical signs and symptoms related to the medical complication shall indicate entry into this phase. In this phase, the diet shall be transitioned from F75 to RUTF (or to therapeutic milk _ F100 for Phase 2 inpatient care). Wasted children start to gain weight, while children with edema may continue to lose weight until the edema is resolved. Once the child is taking the prescribed amount of RUTF and complications are adequately resolved they shall be referred to OTC to continue their treatment at home. 

c. Phase 2: Where it is not possible to refer to OTC,'children shall remain as inpatients until cured of acute malnutrition. This phase shall continue treatment with F100 therapeutic milk or RUTF, increasing the intake so as to promote rapid weight gain. The child shall remain under treatment until the criteria for discharge are reached. 

2. Outpatient Therapeutic Care (OTC) provides treatment for children with SAM who have appetite and no medical complications. These children can be treated at home with simple routine medicines and RUTF. All cases admitted to OTC shall be provided with oral antibiotics in line with IMCI guidelines. 

3. Targeted Supplementary Feeding Program (TSFP) provides treatment for children with MAM. These children can be treated at home with RUSF or locally available supplementary food (fortiﬁed with micronutrient poWders) and intensive nutrition counselling plus routine health care (consistent with IMCI guidelines, outpatient treatment of infections or referral to hospitals), in line with national Supplementary Feeding Guidelines 

F. Recovery and Links with Existing Programs 

The child being treated for acute malnutrition suffers from some combination of nutritional deﬁcit and infection and often may come from the poorest families in the community. 


In order to continue healthy growth and prevent relapse, follow up care shall be sought. Depending on services available locally, the following shall be considered by health and nutrition community workers and hospital staff: 


1. Referral to a supplementary feeding program. 

2. Strengthen on— going IYCF support coupled with intensive nutrition counselling (e. g. IYCF Peer counselling, Family Development Sessions, Pabasa sa Nutrisyon) with referral to milk bank facilities or provision for wet/ cross nursing options. 

3. Micronutrient supplementation in line with national guidelines. 

4. Referral to Mother support groups and activities on Promotion of Good Nutrition. 

5. Enrollment in routine growth monitoring program Operation Timbang Plus (if not yet enrolled). 

6. Referral to a food security and livelihood program. 

7. Social welfare services available and referral to any relevant programs. 

8. Ensure enrolment and coverage of the child and mother in Phil Health or other social safety nets, as required by the family. 

G. Supplies and Logistics 

1. The overall management of all drugs, supplies, therapeutic and supplementary commodities, and diagnostic I tools for PIMAM, and the development and dissemination of corresponding guidelines and protocols shall be the responsibility of the DOH and the local government units. 

2. The local governmentunits shall ensure that policies and guidelines for SAM treatment supplies management are implemented properly at their level. They shall also actively participate in the monitoring and evaluation of the implementation of these policies and guidelines. 

3. Quantiﬁcation and ordering shall be based on utilization rate, projected 1ncrease of cases due to strengthened case ﬁnding and provision of buffer stocks for emergencies. Buffer stocks shall be maintained at 20% to be lodged at the DOH Regional Ofﬁces or Provincial Health Ofﬁces as needed. 

4. Medicines and nutrition supplies shall be stored under appropriate conditions and accounted for through proper recording and reporting. Stock status shall be reﬂected in the National Online Stock Inventory Reporting System (N OSIRS) 

5. The DOH Regional Ofﬁces, PHOs, and CHOs shall ensure that drugs and diagnostic supplies are promptly distributed to the next level. The DOH Central Ofﬁce shall deliver the commodities to the DOH Regional Ofﬁces. DOH Regional Ofﬁces shall deliver the commodities to the PHOs/CHOs. PHOs and CHOs shall ensure the prompt delivery of the commodities to RHUs/Hospitals which shall serve as the Point of Care under the Service Delivery Network. 

6. Disposal of expired and damaged medicines and nutritional supplies shall follow government rules and regulations. 

7. The DOH Regional Ofﬁces shall be responsible for the reproduction of all forms used 1n the treatment of SAM to be distributed to PHOs/CHOs, RHUs, and hospitals.

8. LGUs shall set aside funds for the emergency procurement of sufﬁcient quantities of drugs and nutrition supplies in times of impending shortage to ensure continuous availability of SAM treatment commodities at their service delivery points.

H. Monitoring and Evaluation of PIMAM 

1. Monitoring and data collection in order to report on PIMAM indicators shall be performed through meetings, registration and reporting from community and health facility level, and through speciﬁc assessments conducted at municipality level of coverage. 

2. Monthly collation and analysis shall be performed at the health facilities. Quarterly and annual consolidated and analyzed reports shall be submitted to the next higher level using the prescribed schedules, forms and templates in line with the Manual of Operations. 

3. Among the many indicators to be monitored in PIMAM, there are core indicators that can facilitate efﬁcient monitoring and evaluation and even bottleneck analysis. The following SAM indicators shall be measured both at the community and the facility level disaggregated by age and gender:  

a. Number of admissions — total number of SAM children admitted into the program  during the reporting month. 

b. SAM Cure Rate — number of admitted SAM children &lt 5 years successfully discharged cured as a percentage of all discharged SAM cases during the reporting month; Discharge is the sum of children cured, died, defaulted, and non-cured (Target: >75% cured). 

c. SAM Default Rate — number of admitted SAM children &lt 5 years who defaulted (recorded as absent for 3 consecutive sessions - 3 visits in OTC or 3 days in ITC) as a percentage of all discharges during the reporting month (Target: &lt 15% defaulted). 

d. SAM Death Rate -— number of admitted SAM children &lt 5 years who died during treatment as a percentage of all discharges during the reporting month (Target: &lt 10% died). 

e. SAM Non-Cured Rate w number of admitted SAM children &lt 5 years discharged as non-cured as a percentage of all discharged SAM cases during the reporting month; non-cured is deﬁned as not reaching discharge criteria after 4 months in the program as long as all possible interventions and follow-up have been attempted. 

f. RUTF or F75 Stock-out Rate — number of health facilities with stock-outs of RUTF or F75 in the last 3 months as a percentage of all health facilities managing these commodities. 

g. SAM Human Resources Rate —- number of health workers who have been trained on SAM management as a percentage of all health workers in SAM implementation/target areas. 

h. Geographical Access — number of health facilities offering SAM treatment as a percentage of all health facilities 1n SAM implementation/target areas. 

i. Utilization Rate —~ number of children &lt 5 with SAM who were admitted for SAM treatment as a percentage of identiﬁed SAM cases in implementation/target areas). 

The following MAM indicators shall be measured by all PIMAM implementers and program managers: 

a. MAM Cure Rate — proportion of children 6-59 months with MAM discharged as cured out of total number of discharged MAM cases; Discharge is the sum of children cured, died, defaulted, transferred (children who transferred from one SFP to another), and non-responder (Target: &gt 75%). 

b. MAM Default Rate — proportion of children 6-59 months with MAM recorded as ' absent for 3 consecutive sessions out of total number of discharged MAM cases (Target: &lt 15%). 

c. MAM Death Rate — proportion of children 6- 59 months with MAM who died while in treatment out of total discharged MAM cases (Target: &lt 3%). 

d. MAM Non-Responder Rate - proportion of children 6-59 months with MAM who had been referred for medical investigation and are discharged non-responder according to discharge criteria after 4 months of treatment out of total discharged MAM cases (Target: &lt 15%).

I. PIMAM in Emergencies and Disasters 

a. Where PIMAM is implemented, a support for BNS / BHW in screening for cases of SAM in the community, aiming to augment rather than replace current services; volunteers / assistants may provide ancillary help at the BHS / RHU. 

- Provision of mobile OTC teams for communities unable to access health care and/or the establishment of temporary OTC sites in camps where health centers and / or health staff are affected by disaster. 
- Provision of additional resources such as medicines and RUTF — based on calculated post-emergency caseload; buffer stocks from regular program may be used to ensure that children who need. it are provided the service immediately. 
- Implementation of IYCF in emergencies services. 
- Temporary ITC sites if hospital services for cases of SAM with complications where hospital services become inaccessible. 
- If TSFP is available, ensure proper screening and referral of children with MAM. 

b. Where no SAM treatment service is currently implemented, the implementation will likely require the assistance of neighboring local government units or local or international NGOs with previous experience on PIMAM. Coordination of programming for the treatment of SAM shall be done through the relevant local authorities and the Nutrition Cluster. 

-The focus is on achieving high treatment coverage and early admission to treatment before complications can develop. As such, community mobilization and OTC services shall always be prioritized over ITC. 
-Before implementation, the emergency program must have a well-deﬁned and sustainable ‘transition strategy’.
