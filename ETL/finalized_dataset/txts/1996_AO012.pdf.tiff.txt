<subject>SUBJECT: Implementing guidelines on Sustainable Preventive and Vector Control Measures of the Malaria Control Program.</subject>

<body>


The Philippines was among the 96 member countries of the World Health Organization (WHO) which indorsed the New Global Malaria Control Strategy. This was adopted during the Ministerial Conference on Malaria in Amsterdam, Netherlands last October 1992. The essential elements of the Strategy include Sustainable Preventive and Vector Control Measures.

In response to this commitment, the Department of Health (DOH), through the Malaria Control Service (MCS), conducted a series of Consultative Meetings to come up with the implementing guidelines. The participants were the MCS staff, the Malaria Coordinators, the Assistant Provincial Health Officers and the WHO Consultants.



1. DEFINITIONS

Sustainable Preventive and Vector Control Measures refer to the adoption of measures for the prevention and control against the malaria parasite and the mosquito vector, which are affordable, applicable and appropriate under our local conditions so that these measures can be sustained throughout the duration of malaria control operations. 

These control measures are applied in the appropriate endemic areas in accordance with the following stratification criteria: 

A. Type “A” area - has a Parasite Rate in children 10 years old and below of ≥2%; is mountainous and forested; and with temporary/makeshift houses, cultural minorities, seasonal population movement and agriculturally-less developed

B. Type “B” area - has a Parasite Rate in Children 10 years old and below of ≥2%; is in the forest fringes, plains or coastal areas, and with more or less permanent houses and agriculturally developed.

C. “MEPA” (Malaria Epidemic Prone Area) is any area with a Parasite Rate in children 10 years old and below of ≤2%.



2. OBJECTIVES

2.1 To reduce the source of infection in the human population.

2.2 To reduce the man-vector contact.

2.3 To reduce the density of the mosquito vector population.



3. GUIDELINES


3.1 On Chemoprophylaxis

3.1.1 Drugs are given as a preventive measure to residents (from non-endemic areas) who are visiting malaria endemic areas; otherwise, this is not recommended.

3.1.2 Only Chloroquine drugs should be given, to be taken at weekly intervals, starting from 1—2 weeks before entering the endemic area and continued until 4-6 weeks after leaving the area. In pregnant women, it is given starting on the 4th month of pregnancy. 

3.1.3 The following table is the Chemoprophylaxis Treatment Schedule Guide.

3.1.4 This can be performed by the Field Assistance Worker (FAW), the Rural Health Midwife (RHM) or the Municipal Malaria Coordinator (MMC) in their respective areas of coverage-at the Main Health Center (MHC), at the Barangay Health Station (BHS) or in the ﬁeld. 

 
3.2 On Insecticide—Treatment of Mosquito Net

3.2.1 Mosquito nets are soaked in an insecticide solution and allowed to dry, and used as a protective measure against the vector mosquito while asleep at night.

3.2.2 The coverage includes all malaria-endemic areas, with priority implementation given to type “A” and type “B” areas based on stratiﬁcation guidelines.

3.2.3 The insecticide shall be provided by the Malaria Control Service (MCS).

3.2.4 The MMC or the FAW shall inform the barangay leaders who, in turn, shall inform their respective communities, on the schedule of this activity.

3.2.5 This shall be undertaken by the MMC, FAW or any MCP personnel every 6 months at the BHS, barangay hall or any selected place.

3.2.6 The mosquito net shall be secured by the respective household owners. Those who are unable to do so can make a request from the barangay leaders how to obtain them. Regarding this, the MCS has allocated and provided guidelines to the RFOs for the distribution of mosquito nets as seed investment for the different malaria-endemic provinces. The LGUs, in their respective areas of jurisdiction, shall collaborate with the MCP personnel concerned regarding the distribution process. It is suggested that they develop ﬁnancial schemes or income-generating activities to enable the community to provide mosquito nets for all households

3.2.7 The household owners within the catchment malaria—endemic areas shall bring their respective mosquito nets to the designated place at the scheduled date for the mosquito net treatment.


3.3 On House Spraying

3.3.1 Insecticide is applied to the indoor surfaces of the house through spraying. 

3.3.2 Based on the Stratiﬁcation, this is undertaken in type “B” areas only; while Focal Spraying is done in MEPA (Malaria Epidemic-Prone Areas) areas where epidemics have occurred and upon the discretion of the provincial MCP Unit. This can also be done in other areas during epidemics upon the discretion of the provincial Epidemic Team.

3.3.3 The insecticide and spray equipment shall be provided by the MCS, through the provincial MCP Unit. 

3.3.4 The MMC or the FAW shall inform the barangay leaders who, in turn, shall inform their respective communities on the schedule of this activity, including the target areas and houses.

3.3.5 This shall be undertaken by the FAWs or any MCP-personnel who will visit all targetted houses within the barangay on at least a 1-cycle basis each year and should be completed before the peak of transmission in the area concerned.

3.3.6 The household owners shall be encouraged by the barangay leaders to submit their houses for spraying; they shall be instructed by the sprayman on the precautionary measures before and after spraying the house.

3.3.7 The LGUs shall provide assistance to the spray teams within their respective areas of jurisdiction: this could be m the form of temporary quarters, location guide or even security against social unrest, particularly in rebel-infested areas.

3.3.8 The Spraying Operations should be undertaken on the 4th quarter of the present year or on the 1st quarter of the following year.


3.4 On Stream Seeding

3.4.1 This is the propagation of ﬁsh that eat the larvae of the vector mosquito. This larvivorous ﬁsh, then, are sowed in breeding streams after a month.

3.4.2 This is implemented in all malaria-endemic areas based on the stratification; but only the foothill streams are targetted, the number of which shall be determined by the MMC.

3.4.3 The construction of bio-ponds for fish propagation shall be the responsibility of the LGUs and their corresponding communities. The number of bio-ponds to be constructed, as sources of larvivorous ﬁsh, for each malaria-endemic municipality will depend on the number of streams to be seeded with the propagated larvivorous fish.

3.4.4 The MMC or any MCP personnel shall provide guidelines for the ﬁsh to be seeded, the construction of the bio-ponds,. the fish propagation, the streams to be seeded and the stream seeding procedure.

3.4.5 The community shall obtain for the fish fingerlings to be propagated or the larvivorous ﬁsh to be seeded and shall undertake the propagation and stream seeding activities.

3.4.6 Seeding shall be done once a year during the vectors’ peak density months.

3.4.7 The MMC shall provide information on the peak density months.

3.4.8 Approximately 2—4 ﬁshes per sq. m. are needed to produce an immediate impact; on the other hand 200-400 ﬁshes per ha. are needed for a delayed effect.


3.5 On Stream Clearing

3.5.1 Vegetations overhanging along stream banks are cut to expose breeding streams to sunlight, rendering it unsuitable for mosquito vector habituation.

3.5.2 Implemented in all malaria-eddemic areas based on the Stratiﬁcation, but the MMC shall determine the target streams to be cleared in the respective barangays.

3.5.3 The MMC or any MCP personnel shall provide guidelines for the streams to be cleared and the stream clearing procedure.

3.5.4 The Community shall obtain the clearing instruments and shall undertake this activity every 3 months.


3.6 Other Preventive Measures

3.6.1 Clothes which cover arms and legs should be worn in the evening.

3.6.2 Outdoor night activities, particularly during the vector’s peak biting hours from 9 pm to 3 am, should be avoided.

3.6.3 Mosquito repellents such as mosquito coils, soap, lotion or other personal protection measures advocated by the DOH/MCS.

3.6.4 Neem trees or other herbal plants which are (potential) mosquito repellents as advocated by the MCS/MCS should be cultivated.

3.6.5 Zooprophylaxis which makes use of domestic animals like the carabao, cow, etc. and placed near human dwellings to deviate mosquito bites from man to these animals. 

Please be guided accordingly.
