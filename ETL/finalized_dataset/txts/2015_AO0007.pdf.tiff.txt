BASIC PRINCIPLES OF FOOD SAFETY 

SECTION 5. Food Safety Requirements. To ensure food safety, the following general guidelines shall be observed: 

Rule 5.1 Food safety requirements shall guide decision—making on potential adverse health effects that may occur from the consumption of the food and the need to identify risk management options. 

Rule 5.2 The food business operator (F80) and the regulatory agency shall take the necessary steps to be knowledgeable of the conditions under which food could become unsafe or injurious to health. 

(a) In determining whether food is unsafe, the following shall be considered: (1) The normal conditions of the use of food by the consumer; 

Rule 5a.1. Food shall be presented in accordance with their intended use as provided for in the specific guidelines developed and determined by the FSRA. 

(2) The normal conditions maintained at each stage of primary production, processing, handling, storage and distribution; 

(3) The health of plants and animals from where the food is derived; 

(4) The effect of feeds, crop protection chemicals and other production inputs on otherwise healthy plants and animals; and 

(5) The information provided to the consumer. This includes the information provided on the label or any information generally available to the consumer. This should aid consumers in avoiding specific health effects from a particular food or 

Rule 5a.2 All information provided to consumers on food and its preparation, such as during cooking demonstrations, cooking shows, fresh and processed food product launching and other similar activities, shall observe the requirements for hygienic food handling and other practices for safe food preparation. 

(b) In determining whether food is injurious to health, regard shall be given to the following: 

(1) The probable immediate, short—term or long-term effects on subsequent generations of that food on health; 

Rule 5b.1. The DOH shall monitor the effects of food on the health of individuals and on subsequent generations (e.g. non-communicable diseases, micronutrient deﬁciencies). 

(2) The probable cumulative effects; and 

(3) The particular health sensitivities of a speciﬁc category of consumers where the food is intended for that category. 

(c) In determining whether food is unﬁt for human consumption, regard shall be given to the unacceptability of the food according to its intended use due to contamination by extraneous matter or through putrefaction, deterioration or decay; 

Rule 5c.1 In declaring a food unﬁt for human consumption, the condition of the food shall be evaluated through physical, chemical, microbiological, microscopic and other tests, whenever necessary. 

(d) Where unsafe food, is part of a batch, lot or consignment of food of the same class or description, it shall be presumed that all food in that batch, lot or consignment is also unsafe; 

(e) Food that complies with speciﬁc national law or regulations governing food safety shall be deemed safe insofar as the aspects covered by national law and regulations are concerned. However, imported food that is declared unsafe, by the competent authority of the exporting country after entry into the country shall be withdrawn from the market and distribution channels; and 

(f) Compliance of a food product with speciﬁc standards applicable to a speciﬁc food shall not prohibit the competent authorities to take appropriate measures or to impose restrictions on entry into the market or to require its withdrawal from the market, where there is reason to suspect that such food product shows food safety related risks. 

Rule 5f.1 FSRAs shall restrict entry into the market or apply other measures to protect consumer health when food meeting speciﬁc standards is subsequentlyfound to be a potential source of food safety related risks. The measures shall be, enforced until new scientiﬁc data are obtained and /or after appropriate testing (I‘ll and inspection are carried out to conﬁrm safety of the food). 

 
ARTICLE IV 

GENERAL PRINCIPLES 

SECTION 6. Food Law Objectives. - Food law shall aim for a high level of food safety, protection of human life and health in the production and consumption of food. It shall also aim for the protection of consumer interests through fair practices in the food trade.
