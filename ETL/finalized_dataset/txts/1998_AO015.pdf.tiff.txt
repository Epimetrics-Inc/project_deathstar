<body>

I. RATIONALE

In the interest of the service and in line with the human resource management program and policies of the Department, the guidelines relative to secondment of DOH officials and employee are hereby prescribed. These guidelines are consistent and in accordance with Section 9, Rule VII (Other Personnel Actions) of Book V of Executive Order 292 and Omnibus Rules.



II. COVERAGE

These guidelines shall cover all DOH officials and employees, including those from the Special and Specialty Hospitals and Attached Agencies. 



III. DEFINITION OF TERMS

1. SECONDMENT — is a movement of an official or employee from one department or agency to another, or to any international body/organization recognized by the Philippine government. It is temporary in nature which may
or may not require the issuance of an appointment but may either involve reduction or increase in compensation. 

2. MOTHER AGENCY - refers to the Department of Health (DOH).

3. RECEIVING AGENCY - refers to any other national government agency or international organizations recognized by the Philippine government (e.g. WHO, UNICEF, WORLD BANK or IMF) where. an official/employee shall be seconded; also known as the “seconding agency”.



IV. POLICIES / GUIDELINES

1. The grant for permission of secondment shall consider the following:

a.) continued delivery of specialized and targeted assignments of the office, in particular, and the smooth operations of the Department, in general, are ensured. Hence, an understudy who can equally perform the duties and functions of the seconded official/employee shall be trained and placed, especially if the latter holds a key and critical position, the exercise of which is so vital as to affect the quality, quantity and/or timeliness of the expected outputs and services of the agency.

b.) balance between the organizational requirements and the needs of the, applicant-official/employee. In case of competing and conflicting needs, organizational needs should be given preference. 

c.) yield transfer of knowledge and skill gained by the seconded official/employee from the Receiving agency to the Department.

2. Not more than 5% of the total occupied first level (SG 1—9) and second level (SG 10-26) plantilla positions of an office (Service/Bureau, etc); and 5% of the total occupied third level (SG 27 and above) positions in the Department, may leave at any one time for purposes of secondment. 

3. Officials and employees who wish to be seconded must have served the Department for at least five (5) years.

4. Secondment shall in no case exceed one (1) year. If extension is requested, it shall be subject to approval of the Secretary as well as by the Civil Service Commission.

5. Secondment shall always be covered by a written agreement between the mother agency (DOH) and the receiving agency and concurred in by the seconded official/employee. Such agreement shall be submitted to the Civil Service Commission for records purposes.

6. The seconded official/employee shall be on leave without pay in his/her mother agency for the duration of the secondment, i.e., he/she shall have a gap in his/her service in the Department during such period. 

However, the services of an official/employee who is seconded to international body can be considered government service if he/she is holding a position in the said international organization in compliance with an international commitment of the Philippine Government. Thus, in such case there shall be no gap in his/her service with the Department of Health.

7. During the period of secondment, the seconded official or employee may earn leave credits which are commutable immediately thereafter at and payable by the receiving agency. 

8. While the seconded official/employee is on leave without pay in his/her mother agency, an approved leave application shall no longer be needed, because the written agreement shall be enough basis for approval of the
application for secondment.

9. Payment of salaries of seconded official/employee shall be borne by the receiving/seconding agency. In case of a higher compensation covered by the duly issued appointment within the Philippine government, the same may be used for the purpose of computing his/her retirement benefits but not for the purpose of commutation of leave credits earned in the mother agency. In case of lower compensation, the mother agency shall pay the difference. This rule does not apply in cases of secondment to international agencies.

10. In case of secondment of first and second level employees, the Head of Agency may fill the seconded employee’s item by a SUBSTITUTE APPOINTMENT during the period of his/her secondment.

11. Officials/employees who have scholarship service obligations may be allowed to be seconded provided they have served at least six (6) months or 1/2 of their service/obligations, whichever is longer.

12. An official/employee who had already been seconded may be seconded again under the following items:

13. Secondment may be terminated earlier when the exigencies of the service so require and such a condition shall be expressly indicated in the agreement or contract. 



V. MECHANICS 

1. Should there be an instance for secondment, the official/employee shall submit a written request, duly recommended by the Head of Agency/Assistant Secretary/Undersecretary concerned, to the Office of the Secretary for approval. 

2. Upon approval, the official/employee-applicant shall come up with a Memorandum of Agreement (MOA) to be prepared by the Receiving Agency.

3. The MOA shall then be endorsed to the Office of the Secretary for signature through the Personnel Division, Administrative Service.

4. Before the secondment finally takes effect, the official/employee shall clear him/herself from reports required, as well as all money and property accountabilities.

5. The Personnel Division and Records Section of the General Services Division, Administrative Service shall be furnished copy/ies of the signed MOA for notation and recording purposes.
