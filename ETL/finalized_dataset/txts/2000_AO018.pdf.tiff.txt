<subject>SUBJECT: Amendment of the Department of Health (DOH) Clearance Certificate Form to include Management Information Systems Division of the Management Advisory Service (MISD—MAS)</subject>

<body>

The Management Information Systems Division — Management Advisory Service (MISD-MAS) as the information technology group of the Department at Health (DOH) supports other services/units under the Department in ensuring availability of information technology equipment and devices. As such, as assistance to these units, MAS loans computers and computer peripherals on a temporary or permanent basis.

In order to properly transfer accountability for equipment/spare parts which have been loaned out and thereby avoid loss of government property when employee or responsible staff retires/resigns from the DOH, the Clearance Certificate is hereby amended to include

This revised form as attached shall be in effect March 1, 2000.
