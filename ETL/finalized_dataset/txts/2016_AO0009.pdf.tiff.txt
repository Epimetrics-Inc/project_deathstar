<subject>SUBJECT: Revised Implementing Guidelines for the Electronic Drug Price Monitoring System (EDPMS)</subject>


<body>
I RATIONALE 

In 2008, Republic Act (RA) No. 9502, otherwise known as the Universally Accessible Cheaper and Quality Medicines Act was enacted mandating the Secretary of Health to establish an electronic price monitoring and regulation system for drugs and medicines. In line with this directive, the Department of Health piloted. the Electronic Essential Drug Price Monitoring System (e—EDPMS) through A0 No. 2008—0014. 

After pilot implementation of the system and following consultation with the end—users and stakeholders, the e—EDPMS was simplified to make it more responsive to the needs of users. Electronic Drug Price Monitoring System (EDPMS) Version 2 was issued through A0 2011- 0012 to expand the scope of implementation to cover all drug establishments and outlets, establish guidelines on data validation, analysis, reports generation and dissemination, monitoring and evaluation, and strengthen and provide more coherent roles and responsibilities of the different agencies and stakeholders involved in the implementation of the system. 

In the course of implementing AO No. 2011-0012, iss'ues and concerns have been raised regarding the difﬁculty of. uploading data into the system resulting in a low turn-out of data collection. The most recent information showed that only an average of 25% of drug establishments and outlets are reporting to the system before the moratorium was issued. Complaints vary from inaccessibility of the website, difficulty of sending data to the server, unavailability of internet connection in far ﬂung areas and lack of training of IT personnel. 

The primary aim of the EDPMS is to address the information asymmetry in medicine prices and to empower patients and consumers in exercising intelligent choices when purchasing medicines fromboth the public and private retail outlets. The EDPMS shall be used likewise as a vital reference of the DOH in formulating pricing policies for essential medicines to ensure the afibrdability and availability of essential medicines in the market. 

It is in the above light, that this revised implementing guideline is issued to improve the system and make it more efﬁcient and effective, such that data gathering and data analysis becomes more relevant and manageable.
