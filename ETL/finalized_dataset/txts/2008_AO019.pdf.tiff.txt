<doctype>ADMINISTRATIVE ORDER</doctype>
<docnum>NO. 2008 - 0019</docnum>

 

<subject>SUBJECT: Revised Schedule of Fees for the Registration and
Licensure of Dental Laboratories in the Philippines</subject>

<body>
I. Rationale

By virtue of Administrative Order No. 2008-0010, known as “Revised Rules and Regulations Governing the Registration and Licensure of Dental Laboratories in the Philippines”, the classification of dental laboratories according to service capability was revised. Dental laboratories were previously classified as either primary, secondary, or tertiary. They are now classified as either removable prostheses services, fixed prostheses services, removable and fixed prostheses services, or limited services.

In this regard, the Bureau of Health Facilities and Services, the main
instrumentality of the Department of Health responsible for setting and reviewing regulatory policies and standards of health facilities, is amending the schedule of fees for the registration and licensure of dental laboratories embodied in Administrative Order No. 2007-0001, known as “Revised Schedule of Fees for Certain Services Rendered by the Bureau of Health Facilities and Services and Centers for Health Development in Relation to the Regulation of Health Facilities and Services and Validity Period of License to Operate, Accreditation, Authority to Operate, and Clearance to Operate for Certain Health Facilities and Services”.

II. Objective

This Order prescribes the schedule of fees for the registration and licensure of dental laboratories.

III. Scope

The schedule of fees shall apply to any individual, corporation, association or organization; national, provincial, city, municipal or other political unit; or department, division, board or agency thereof applying for the registration and licensure of dental laboratories.

IV. General and Specific Guidelines

A. Fees

2. The CHD may charge an additional fee of not more than twenty percent (20%) of the initial or renewal fee depending on the actual costs incurred by the CHD for services rendered.

3. If additional inspection/s is/are needed before issuance of license to operate (LTO), re-inspection fee equal to one hundred percent (100%) of the initial or renewal fee shall be imposed over and above the initial or renewal fee for every re-inspection.

4. If renewal of LTO is filed within 90 calendar days before the expiration date, a ten percent (10%) discount on the renewal fee shall be granted.

5. If renewal of LTO is filed less than a year after the expiration date, surcharge equal to fifty percent (50%) of the renewal fee shall be imposed over and above the renewal fee.

6. The LTO not renewed for more than a year after the expiration date shall be considered lapsed and registration cancelled. The dental laboratory shall register and apply for an initial LTO before it can be allowed to operate. Arrears equal to one hundred percent (100%) of the renewal fee for every year lapsed shall be imposed over and above the fees for registration and initial LTO.

7. Fees are non-refundable. They are paid to the CHD Cashier in person or through postal money order

Any administrative issuances, rules and regulations inconsistent herewith are hereby repealed, modified, or amended accordingly.

In the event that any section, paragraph, sentence, clause or word of this Order is declared invalid for any reason, the other provisions thereof shall not be affected thereby.
