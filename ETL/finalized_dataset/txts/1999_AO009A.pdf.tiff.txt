I. RATIONALE

The Integrated Community Health Service Project (ICHSP), under the Department of Health (DOH), is a response to the changes brought about by the implementation of the Local Government Code in the health care delivery system.

One of the strategies employed by the HRMD component is on continuing professional education in terms of skills development, value-orientation workshops, upgrading and enhancing capabilities on management, and exploring innovative but effective methodologies from other known models for adoption to ensure efficient and effective delivery of health service to the Filipino people.

In this light, the Integrated Community Health Service Project provides continuing educational programs for both hospital-based and public health workers and local government unit personnel and staff involved in program implementation. To ensure maximum benefits from these opportunities, a rational and systematic process in the implementation of local and foreign scholarships shall be institutionalized.
