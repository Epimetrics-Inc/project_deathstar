SECTION 12 EVALUATION PROCEDURES

The evaluation of dental health programs is of paramount importance. Effectiveness of such programs may be presumed, however, such presumption may not be always safe. Unforeseen circumstances, insufficiency of prescribed methods and activities and other factors may have altered the effectiveness of a program hence, the need of evaluation. Perhaps, a method is workable in some countries, but not in ours or perhaps, our program is truly workable and effective. Then, we have to show proof that it is so.

The representative from the Department of Health and/or the Regional Health Office represented by a Regional Health Offices shall evaluate programs of the private school dental services. The private school dentist shall likewise evaluate his/her own program.

For the purpose of evaluating the efforts and effects of a program, two methods may be utilised, namely: direct method for efforts and the indirect method for service statistics.
