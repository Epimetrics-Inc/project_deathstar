The Department of Health (DOH) through its Visual Health Program is mandated to ensure that cataract surgery is made available, accessible and affordable to every Filipino in order to reduce the prevalence of cataract in our country. Among the critical area of concern is the proper management of its logistics, hence the formulation of this guideline.
