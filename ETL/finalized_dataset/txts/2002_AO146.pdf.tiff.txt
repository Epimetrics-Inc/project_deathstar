<subject>SUBJECT: IMPLEMENTING GUIDELINES OF THE ELECTRONIC PROCUREMENT SYSTEM IN THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH CENTRAL OFFICE USING A PRIVATE SECTOR PARTNER PLATFORM</subject>

<body>
I. RATIONALE

The Department of Health (DOH) in line with the government's efforts to uphold transparency and accountability, and achieve equity, effectiveness, efficiency and economy in its' operations, had sought to implement an electronic procurement system.

The DOH is authorized to avail of the services of the private sector to perform activities beneficial to the public as prescribed in the pertinent provisions of several statutes. Such authorization are prescribed specifically in Republic Act No. 7718 (An act amending certain sections of RA. No. 6957 entitled "An act authorizing the financing, construction, operation and maintenance of infrastructure projects by the private sector, and for other purposes") and National Computer Center (NCC) Memorandum Circular (MC)99-02 entitled "Prescribing Guidelines for I.T. Resource Acquisition in Government" particularly section 5.2. The latter issuance succinctly provide the degrees of preference on the mode of acquisition of service, to wit:

"Preferred Acquisition Mode in the financing of IT resources, preference is given in the following order: BOT and its' operating variants, Grants, Counter-trade, Foreign Loans and the General Fund as the last option."

The DOH in its bid to continuously comply with the Republic Act No. 8792 also known as the "Electronic Commerce Law of 2000" which obliges Government Agencies to establish electronic commerce portals by 2002, had availed of the services of an interested private sector organization to establish its electronic Procurement System requirements through a scheme that is functionally equivalent to the Build-Own-Operate operating variant wherein the DOH shall own the information that shall be generated by the electronic Procurement System platform and yet will be free of the burden of cost. And that costs shall be yoked upon the vendors who wish to enroll in the electronic-Procurement System that shall be maintained and owned by the private sector business organization.

And so as stated in the preceding, the DOH had entered into an Agreement with the firm Our-bid.corn last October 18, 2001 through a Memorandum of Agreement which was renewed recently last August 1, 2002. Further giving impetus to the MOA was that the system has been duly evaluated for its conformity with the Implementing Rules and Regulations of Executive Order No. 40, entitled, "Consolidating procurement rules and procedures for all national government agencies, government-owned or controlled corporations and government financial institutions, and requiring the use of the government electronic procurement system".
