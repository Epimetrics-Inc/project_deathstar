<subject>SUBJECT: Amendment to Administrative Order No. 2010-0017 dated June 18, 2010 regarding Guidelines in Surveillance and Response to Adverse Events Following Immunization (AEFI) </subject>


<body>
When a serious AEFI occurs, appropriate actions have to be taken immediately otherwise this will erode the conﬁdence of the public on the immunization program of the Department of Health resulting to a drop in the immunization coverage. It is on this premise that the National AEFI Committee (N AEFIC) was established at the national level to conduct causality assessment and address other issues about serious AEFIs nationwide. However, after series of consultative workshops, the local government units expressed their concern for the need to organize an AEFI committee at the regional and provincial levels whose function is to conduct immediate preliminary causality assessment of reported serious AEFIs. This important concern however, is not deﬁned in the present guidelines for surveillance and response to AEFIs. If this concern is addressed, it is expected that there will be signiﬁcant changes or adjustments in the guidelines because this will have a direct effect to other provisions or sections of the document. 

For efﬁcient and effective implementation of AEFI surveillance and response at the local level, Administrative Order No. 2010-0017 is hereby amended as follows: 

Section IV - OBJECTIVE 

This Order aims to guide the concerned stakeholders on the early detection and appropriate response to adverse events following immunization. 

Section V — DEFINITION OF TERMS 

2. AEFI Table and its deﬁnition shall be deleted 

3. Changed Causation—infact to: 

Causality Assessment - A systematic review of data about an AEFI case to determine the likelihood of a causal association between the event and the vaccine(s) received.

8. Deﬁnition of Immunization Safety shall now be: 

The public health practices and policies dealing with the various aspects of the correct administration of vaccines, focusing on minimizing the risk of transmission of disease with vaccination and maximizing the effectiveness of the vaccine. The term encompasses the spectrum of events from proper manufacture to correct administration. ' 

12. Change Pharmacovigilance to: 

Pharmacovigilance Unit - The unit responsible for the monitoring, collecting, assessing and evaluating adverse event reports from pharmaceutical products and recommending policy/ guideline to prevent further occurrence of . adverse effects or any other medicine related problem.
