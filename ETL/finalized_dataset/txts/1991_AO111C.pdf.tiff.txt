1.4  “Veterinary Drug and Product Outlet” refers to drugstore, pharmacy or other business establishment registered with Bureau of Food and Drugs (BFAD)/Bureau of Animal Industry (BAI) which dispenses or sells veterinary drugs and products.

SECTION 2. 	GUIDELINES ON DISPENSING BASED ON PRIOR LAWS
