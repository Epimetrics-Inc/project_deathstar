<subject>SUBJECT: Guidelines On the Referral System for Adverse Events Following Immunization (AEFI) of DOH Programs</subject>


<body>
I. BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE 

These guidelines were develOped to strengthen and enhance the referral network System for the AdVerse Events Following Immunization (AEFI) in order to improve the satisfaction level of the beneﬁciaries and their families. Establishment of a functional referral system has been mandated by the 1991 Local Government Code, thus this guideline is reiterating existing policies that mandated the establishment of these systems and provide mechanisms that make them responsive to the needs. of the beneﬁciaries of the Immunization Programs. These policies include the following; 

Administrative Order No. 2016-0006, Revised Guidelines on Surveillance and Response to Adverse Events Fellowing Immunization, that provide guidelines for concerned Stakeholders 0n the early detection, reporting, investigation and appropriate responSe to adverse events following immunization. 

Administrative Order No. 2014- 0046, Defining the Service Delivery NetWorlcs (SDNS) for Universal Health Care or Kalusugan Pangkalahatan, mandated the establishment and organization of SDNS in all Local Government Units to efﬁciently and effectively cover the needs of priority groups and the general population for UH/KP programs and projects. This shall be done in coordination with the program managers and regional ofﬁces. Section V.A.2 of the said policy stated; “SDN shall ensure access to quality” care for every family in the province/ city wide health Systems for: 

a. Population Health interventions, Primary health Care and primary care ' 

b Emergency Medical/Surgical Intervention in General Hospitals 

c. Referral links to Specialty Hospitals & Other Healthfacilities” 

Department of Finance (DOF), Bureau of Internal Revenue (BIR), Department of Health (DOH), Department of Budget and Management (DBM) and Department of Agriculture (DA) Joint Circular No 001 2014, Implementing Rules and Regulations fOr Section 288, Subsections (B) and (C) of the National InternaLﬁevenue Code, as amended by Republic Act No 10351, mandated in Section 4, “The DOH, through the Regional Ofﬁces (ROS) and 1n coordination with the LGUS, shall deﬁne and facilitate the establishment of Service Delivery Networks (SDNS) or local health referral systems for the integrated coordinated and efﬁcient provision of health care to Specific covered ' - populations. The DOH Shall also ensure that skilled health professionals and other allied health professionals hired within an SDN possess the clinical competencies required to deliver quality health care services provided in their facility. The SDNS shall be the basis for estimating the requirements for medical assiStance and health enhanCement facilities program.” 

DOH Manual on Interlocal Health Referral System (ILHRS) Manual, 2002, provided the guidelines in the establishment of an Interlocal Health Referral System, mandated in the Local Government Code. The manual provided a framework on the interlocal health referral system, one that is “often called two-tiered since it involves mainly (1) the-barangay health station, rural health facility, and primary referral hospital (municipal hospital) which provides primary medical care, and (2) a core referral hospital (district hospital) which provides secondary care. In Situations where a provincial hospital falls within an ILHZ’S coverage area, the provincial hospital will act as the core referral hospital. A referral within the ILHZ will only be as strong as the weakest link in the chain of health facilities.” 

Administrative Order No. F AE-007 s. 1998, Policies and Guidelines on the Transfer and Referral of Patients between DOH Metro Manila Hospitals. The guidelines “ensure that proper procedures are followed in transferring emergency room patients as well as in referrals of admitted patients”.
