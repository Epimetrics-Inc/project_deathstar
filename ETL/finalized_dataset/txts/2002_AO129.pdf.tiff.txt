The said model scoring system requires the infrastructure project under review to meet several criteria which include 'project impact', 'project's geographical location' and 'project's priority level' among others ;

4. Approved infrastructure projects costing more than fifteen percent (15%) of the contract cost of the initial or preceding project shall be subject to further review by the Committees; and
