<body>

I. RATlONALE

Presidential Decree 1542 known as the Registration and Licensing of Dental Prosthetic Laboratories and the Revised Administrative Order No. 117â€”B, s. 1992 known as the Revised Rules and Regulations Governing the Registration, Licensure and Operation of Dental Prosthetic Laboratories in the Philippines.

For more than two decades since the enactment of the law, the Bureau of Dental Health Services has been in charge of DPL licensing. By virtue of EO 119, the function was transferred to the Bureau of Licensing and Regulation. Inspections are done yearly prior to the issuance of license to operate. Due to the adoption of economic measures there is a need to change the schedule of inspection of Dental Prosthetic Laboratories from annual to biennial.


II. OBJECTIVE/IMPLEMENTATION

The objective of the revision is to strengthen the efficiency and effectiveness of the Dental Prosthetic Laboratories Licensing system in the Philippines. This revision shall be implemented by all the Regulation Officers at the Central Office and in the Regional Field Office on all Dental Prosthetic Laboratories.


III. SPECIFIC GUIDELINES

A. Dental Prosthetic Laboratories shall be inspected every two years.

B. The licenses to operate shall however be renewed annually as provided for in the revised Administrative Order 117-B, s. 1992.

C. Monitoring of Dental Prosthetic Laboratories shall continue to be undertaken to ensure compliance of licensing requirements.


IV. EFFECTIVITY

This order shall take effect immediately upon its approval. All other existing issuances inconsistent with this Administrative Order are hereby rescinded.
