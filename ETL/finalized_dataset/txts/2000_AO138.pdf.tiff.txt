<subject>SUBJECT: Sustaining the Procurement and Distribution System for Drugs, Medical Devices and Supplies initiated under the FAMUS Project in Support of the Health Sector Reform Agenda</subject>

I. RATIONALE

The quality or health care in hard-to-reach areas of the country is determined largely by the availability of logistics support for health programs particularly drugs. In more urban areas, drug supply may be available in adequate quantities but may not be necessarily  accessible to the majority of the population by reason of cost.

In order to rationalize and improve access to important commodities and to attain utmost quality of health care particularly for the poor, the establishment of a support system for distribution of drugs, medical devices and supplies needs to be carried out.
This system is best pursued in consonance with the objectives of the Health Sector Reform Agenda to improve the delivery of quality healthcare at the local level.

The DOH is currently implementing the FAMUS project with the assistance of the German Government through two development institutions, namely: the German Technical Cooperation (GTZ) and the German Bank for Reconstruction (KfW). The main purpose of the project is to improve the capabilities of identified poor families to manage their own health by providing access to drugs, medical devices and supplies.

The main strategy employed by the project to meet its objective is the development of FAMUS centers at different levels. The FAMUS Mains are located in the provinces and they are linked directly with the Provincial Health Offices. The FAMUS satellites are located in the municipalities and are linked with the rural health units and receiving supplies form the FAMUS mains. The FAMUS outlets are located in barangays and are linked with the barangay health stations and are receiving supplies from the satellites. These FAMUS Centers are managed and operated by trained barangay or family health workers. The basic services provided through the family workers are those of family planning and other reproductive health services. The supply of essential medical and family planning commodities is done through a procurement and distribution system that the FAMUS project developed as part of its project deliverable.

By the Year 2001, the FAMUS project will end its second term and an evaluation shall determine the final phase of the project. However there are serious concerns about the sustainability of its current operations. At the moment the project is largely dependent  on donated commodities provided under the grant agreement with the German Government. Therefore, a sustainability mechanism needs to be put in place to ensure continuity of the services provided by the FAMUWS centres.

It is in this light that the FAMUS project has embarked on an initiative for procurement and distribution of drugs, medical devices and supplies that will involve non-profit and legitimate private entities called pharmaceutical foundations. 

The objectives of this initiative are as follows:

1. To establish an efficient procurement and distribution system for drugs, medical supplies and medical device that will allow poor families access to quality, affordable, and essential drugs and commodities;

2. To ensure that the same procurement and distribution system shall be sustained beyond the project life by enlisting the support and services of non-profit and legitimate entities called pharmaceutical foundations. 


II. DEFINITION OF TERMS

* Drugs - means (1) articles recognized in the official United States Pharmacopoeia, official Momeopathetic Pharmacopeia of the United States, of official National Formulary, or any supplement to any of them; and (2) articles intended for use in the diagnosis, cure, mitigation, treatment or prevention of disease in man or other animals; and (3) articles (other than food) intended to affect the structure or any function of the body of man or animals; and (4) articles intended for use as component of any articles specified in clauses (1), (2), (3) but does not include devices or their components parts or accessories (source : Republic Act No. 3720 as amended).

* Device — means instrument, apparatus or contrivances, including their components, parts, and accessories intended for use in the diagnosis, cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease in man or animals (source: Republic Act No. 3720 as amended).

* Medical Supplies - for purposes of this Administrative Order, are referred to as, those items that are needed in different types of tests, treatments, and interventions at different levels of health care other than drugs or medical devices. 

* Procurement and Distribution System — a system for procuring and distributing formulary-determined drugs and acceptable medical devices and supplies which adhere to DOH and BFAD policies and standards. The system consists of a central wholesaler and distributor with a string of provincial distributors which are supplying a network of community pharmaceutical dispensing units.

* Pharmaceutical foundations — a network of non-government organizations or LGU- organized foundations, as the case maybe, involved in the procurement and distribution of drugs which are SEC-registered, BFAD licensed, DOH accredited, BIR registered and linked in a social franchising agreement for mutual benefit.

* Social franchising - a contract of adhesion entered into by a franchisor and franchisee that establishes a durable, long-term relationship that will impact on every aspect of their relationship especially in terms of effectively and efficiently delivering basic services which are mutually beneficial to them.


III. IMPLEMENTING ARRANGEMENTS

The following describes how the current FAMUS procurement and distribution system is operating, what needs to be done to transform the current system into a sustainable system, and how the new system will operate:

1. Currently, the DOH FAMUS project utilizes a procurement and distribution system for essential commodities using the established public health care delivery system wherein the commodities are provided for using project resources and LGU and NGO counterparts. This system is such that:

- the central warehouse and procurement system handles the procurement, warehousing and distribution of essential commodities to the different provincial units called main warehouse system;

- the main warehouse systems located in the provinces covered by the FAMUS project, handle the supply and distribution of essential commodities to the municipal satellite warehouse systems; 

- the municipal satellite warehouse systems, located in selected municipalities of the project provinces, handle the supply and distribution of essential commodities to the project outlets at the barangay level;

- the barangay outlets (service delivery outlets) handle appropriate dispensing of the commodities thereat through a cost recovery scheme.

2. The systems described above shall be sustained by transforming the current project- subsidized, government-based system into a self-sustaining, non- profit social enterprises. This will be done through the designation of established pharmaceutical  foundations as the organizations to sustain the above operations. The pharmaceutical foundations may take different organizational forms appropriate at the provincial level.

This is to be accomplished by providing initial operational resources coming from the FAMUS project to the national pharmaceutical foundation (NPF). These resources will specifically consist of available stocks and supply which are currently under the central warehousing system as well as the proceeds of the cost recovery scheme developed under the project.

Likewise, a revised implementation plan of the project will include the establishment and employment of capability building systems to ensure that needed skills and knowledge in sustaining the procurement and distribution system are in place.

3. The system described in no. 2 above shall be called the Procurement and Distribution System which will operate in the following manner:

- a national pharmaceutical foundation will be utilized to procure essential drugs from international and local suppliers and provide the provincial pharmaceutical foundations with essential commodities by applying the concept and principles of  social franchising. The DOH policy on procurement based on the Philippine National Drug Formulary volume 1 current edition and the Primary Health Care Drug List shall be followed.

- in turn, the provincial pharmaceutical foundations shall procure from the national pharmaceutical foundation drugs, medical devices and supplies and distribute the same to the barangay outlets/franchisees applying likewise the concept and principles of social franchising.

- barangay outlets/social franchisees shall procure from the provincial pharmaceutical foundation drugs and appropriately dispense these to clients in adherence to the social franchising agreement.

4. Under this system, the DOH shall:

- Support the implementation of the Procurement and Distribution System through  the pharmaceutical foundations and the implementation of the concepts of social franchising as applied to the pharmaceutical foundations;

- Ensure that the pharmaceutical foundations adhere to standards and regulations applicable to their operations and within the context of established guidelines in pharmaceutical procurement and distribution;

- Use this system as an input in the development of local health systems particularly the Health Passport Program;

- Facilitate for the system of service delivery by the outlets to become inputs into the overall effort for expanding social health insurance coverage.


IV. EFFECTIVITY

This Administrative Order shall take effect immediately and shall remain in effect and binding until such time that provisions related hereto are amended.
