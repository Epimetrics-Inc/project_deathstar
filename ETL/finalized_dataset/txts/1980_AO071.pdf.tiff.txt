For better control, the preparation of the periodical general payrolls shall become a function of the Personnel Division, Administrative Services. In this way, the handling of payroll preparation shall be independent of the cash disbursement function and the personnel handling the task do not have access to cash. Furthermore, aside from being actually an administrative matter, the work involves knowledge of the salary rates of individual personnel, record of actual services rendered and leave of absences with or without pay which the personnel division has. From now on, therefore, all general payrolls shall be prepared in said Division.

Payrolls prepared shall be sent to the respective chiefs of services or bureaus concerned for their certification which shall then be forwarded to the chief of Administrative Service for approval.

This Order is made of record.
