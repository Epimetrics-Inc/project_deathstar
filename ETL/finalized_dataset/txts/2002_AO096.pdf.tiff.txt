<subject>SUBJECT : Guidelines for Multiple Micronutrient Supplementatron for Pregnant Women in UNICEF CPC V Areas</subject>


<body>

I. Rationale:

Women in developing countries often have inadequate levels of micronutrients because of limited intake of animal products, fruits , vegetables and fortiﬁed foods. The Recommended Dietary Allowance ( RDA) including those for micronutrients increases substantially especially during pregnancy and lactation which is difﬁcult to meet by diet alone. Studies reveal that micronutrient deﬁciencies result in learning disabilities, mental retardation, poor health, low work capacity, blindness and premature death among women and children.

The Philippines is currently addressing the problem of iron deﬁciency anemia which affects 5 out of 10 pregnant women and 2 out of 10 of thesame women has nightblindness or suffering from vitamin A deﬁciency. Iodine deﬁciency is likewise a public health problem ( 1998 NNS FNRI—DOST) . The average Filipino diet is generally short of recommended daily allowances so that other micronutrients like Zn, Se, etc would also be found deﬁcient or inadequate hence, multiple deﬁciencies may exist.

The consequences of micronutrient deﬁciencies are many and could be permanent. They contribute to increase in morbidity and mortality of the pregnant women, increase incidence of low birth weights, and congenital malformations i.e, folate deﬁciency cause neural tube defects.

The Department of Health cognizant of the need to improve the health status of pregnant women have. designed programs like the iron/folate supplementation and vitamin A supplementationto post—partum mothers. ( AO no 3,s. 2000) However, limited coverage and compliance and ﬁnancial limitations to provide the total requirements and sustain the availability of the micronutrients are the reasons ,Why it is difﬁcult to make a dent in the prevalence of iron deﬁciency and iron deﬁciency anemia and vitamin A deﬁciency. Added to this is the poor economic conditions which make it difﬁcult to consume good food sources of the vitamins and minerals as they could be more expensive.

Multiple micronutrients supplementation have been found beneﬁcial based on a number of studies. It improves the micronutrient status of pregnant and lactating women and it could be one component of a strategy to address micronutrient deﬁciencies of women in developing countries. One major issue however , is what level of nutrient standards to be used. The Philippines have RDA (l989-FNRI) which could be followed for the country, however it is not complete and needs to be updated. On the other hand, the WHO have recommended values for women of reproductive age in developing countries which could be used for reference.

This guideline is issued to serve as reference for health workers in the use of the multiple micronutrient in UNICEF CPC V areas.

II. Objectives

1.To improve the nutritional status of pregnant women.

2. To reduce morbidity/mortality associated with micronutrient deﬁciencies among pregnant women.

3. To improve the health and nutritional status of breastfed infants.

III. Coverage

The use of multiple micronutrients is being recommended by the international communities on health and nutrition and to be considered as a strategy addressing micronutrient deﬁciencies among pregnant women.

United Nations Childrens' Fund (UNICEF ) is introducing the use of multiple micronutrient supplement in the country as part of the micronutrient supplementation program in CPC V areas. The supplement has passed Bureau of Food and Drugs (BFAD) and was approved as a food supplement.

The UNICEF CPC V areas are :

The micronutrient supplement has the following composition :

Literature review showed that the levels of nutrient that are contained in this multiple micronutrient preparation are the minimum daily recommended nutrient levels for women of reproductive age.

IV. Guideline /procedure for Supplementation:

Target : Pregnant women
Dose : One tablet per day
When to start : First trimester of pregnancy until delivery

Precautionary Measures/ Reminders:

Pregnant mothers who are receiving the multiple micronutrient will not be given the preventive supplementation of vitamin A 10,000 I.U which is given 1 capsule of 10,000 I.U . 2x a week from the 4th month of pregnancy until delivery.

Monitoring and Recording

Pregnant mothers taking the multiple micronutrient should be properly recorded and monitored in the target client list which records pre—natal visits and services rendered .

Evaluation

Evaluation shall be done to document impact of multiple micronutrient supplementation i.e., improved nutritional status of pregnant women during the period of gestation, decrease in maternal and child morbidity and mortality, decrease in low birth weights and pregnancy complications. Results of evaluation shall be the basis for future policy recommendations.

V. Implementing Mechanism
Roles and Responsibilities of the CHDs and Local Government Units
1. Oversee the delivery of multiple micronutrients in health facilities
2. Conduct proper orientation of health personnel on implementing guidelines for multiple micronutrient supplementation
3. Record, report and assess accomplishments particularly coverage, and compliance.

VI. Effectivity

This order shall take effect upon its approval.
