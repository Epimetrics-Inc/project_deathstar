<body>

I. Background and Rationale

Health promotion is a process of enabling people to take action-to improve health. The traditional view of promoting health through the one-onuone communication between a doctor and a patient has already been found to be inadequate. A socio-ecological approach to health promotion is now seen to be more appropriate. This takes into consideration the complex environment affecting a person’s well-being, to include lifestyles, behavior patterns, as well as, present and emerging technologies.

In the Philippines, the health situation still shows a high prevalence of infectious diseases like tuberculosis, measles, dengue, and malaria. There is also an increasing trends in degenerative and lifestyle diseases like cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, substance abuse, accident and violence, as well as mental disorders like depression, schizophrenia and anxiety; and the emergence of new diseases like AIDS.

Moreover, there are other factors that may inﬂuence health like globalization, which impact on food supply; transnational inﬂuences, which affect emerging infections, pollution and tobacco control, conﬂict, efﬁciency in governance, and lastly but more importantlyhthe devolution of health services to the Local Government Units (LGUs). This health situation is compounded
by these determinants of health. Determinants are factors that hinder or facilitate improvement in health status of an individual or population groups such as: peace, shelter, education, food, income, a stable ecosystem, sustainable resources, social justice, equity, social security, social relations, empowerment of women, respect for human rights, and poverty. These determinants thus require a secure foundation as basic pre-requisites for health.

Health Promotion is needed in order to:

- Build healthy public policy

Health promotion goes beyond health care. lt puts health on the agenda of policy makers in all sectors and at all levels, directing them to be aware of the health consequences of their decisions and to accept their responsibilities for health.

- Create supportive environments

The links between people and their environment constitutes the basis for a socio-ecological approach to health. Changing patterns of life, work and leisure have a signiﬁcant impact on health. Work and leisure should be a source of health for people. The way society organizes work should help create a healthy society. Health promotion generates living and working conditions that are safe, stimulating, satisfying and enjoyable.

- Strengthen community action

Health promotion works through concrete and effective community action in setting priorities, making decisions, planning strategies and implementing them to achieve better health. At the heart of this process is the empowerment of communities — their ownership and control of their own endeavors and destinies.

- Develop personal skills

Health promotion supports personal and social development by information, education for health, and enhancing life skills. By so doing, it increases the options available to people to exercise more control over their own health and over their environments, and to make choices conducive to health.

- Reorient health services

The responsibility for health promotion in health services is shared among individuals, community groups, health professionals, health service institutions and governments. They must work together towards a health care system which contributes to the pursuit of health.

II. Coverage and Scope

The National Health Promotion Policy shall apply to all health facilities and agencies in the health sector throughout the Philippines. This policy will better serve its priority target clients namely: women, children, older persons, adolescents, indigenous people and the poor and marginalized Filipinos; the legislators; other government agencies; non-governmental
organizations; people's organizations; and the academe. Likewise, it will serve the LGUs which are mandated by law as implementers of health programs and projects. Health promotion policies, therefore, put health in the agenda of implementers in the health sector at all levels making them aware of the consequences of their decisions and to accept their responsibilities to health.
