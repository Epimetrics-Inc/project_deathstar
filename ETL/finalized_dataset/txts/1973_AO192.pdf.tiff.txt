In order to properly implement the new mode of payment of these authorized allowances, the following procedures should be observed in the preparation of claims by those concerned, beginning September, 1973:

The required certification (No. 3 in the above enumeration of conditions) should, as called for, appear on the face of the voucher followed by the signature of the claimant. This voucher should be prepared in four (4) copies and immediately submitted at the end of the month not later than the 5th day of the succeeding month.

If the General Payroll is used, which, in the case of the Rural Health and Family Planning Center personnel would be preferable and advisable for reasons expedlency and economy, the said Payroll should be supported by duly signed individual statements or certifications of all claimants whose names appear in the payroll (sample of such certification attached). The payroll should also be submitted in four (4) copies immediately at the end of the month but not later than the 5th day of the succeeding month.

2. Certification No. 2 - in the payroll should be jointly signed by the Administrative Officer III and the Director, National Family Planning Office, or their authorized representative.

C. For purposes of determining the correct amount due a claimant and proâ€”rating claims on the basis of attendance and performance, a copy of the duly accomplished and approved time record of every claimant for the month covered by the claim should accompany the General Voucher or the General Payroll, unless an additional certification is made by the immediate supervisor and/or countersigned either by the Regional Health Director (for claims filed by the Regional FP Coordinators), or by the Provincial Health Officer (for claims filed by the Provincial FP Coordinators and the RH & FP Center Personnel) to the effect that full-time service has been rendered by each and everyone of the claimants, and that no absence nor absence were incurred during the period of the claim.

The usual flow of papers as laid down in Administrative Order No. 165, s. 1972 should be observed, except in "difficult areas" when the vouchers or payroll coming therefrom may be submitted direct to the National Family Planning Office.

All Department circulars, orderd, rules and regulations, directives, or memoranda, or parts of provisions thereof, which are in conflict with, or contrary to, this order are hereby rescinded or modified accordingly.
