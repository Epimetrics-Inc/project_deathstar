<subject>SUBJECT: The New Implementing Guidelines of the Philippine National Formulary System (PNFS)</subject>


<body>
I. RATIONALE 

The 1987 Philippine Constitution mandates the right of every Filipino to health. It enunciates the policy that “the State shall protect and promote the health of the people and instill health consciousness among them” (Article II Section 15). Moreover, it provides the adoption by the State of an “integrated and comprehensive approach to health development which shall endeavor to make essential goods, health and other social services accessible to all the people at affordable cost” (Article XII Section 15). 

To support these goals, several policies and laws have been passed. These include Republic Act No. 6675 known as the Generics Act of 1988 that was enacted to “ensure the adequate supply of drugs with generic names at the lowest possible cost.” It further states that “in the promotion of the generic names for pharmaceutical products, special consideration shall be given to drugs and medicines which are included in the Essential Drugs List to be prepared within one hundred eighty (180) days from approval of this Act and updated quarterly by the Department of Health on the basis of health conditions obtaining in the Philippines as well as on internationally accepted criteria.” 

Executive Order No. 49 (dated 21 January 1993, entitled “Directing the Mandatory Use of the Philippine National Formulary Volume I as the - Basis for Procurement of Drug Products by the Government”) strengthened the advocacy of the Generics Act by ensuring that only essential medicines identiﬁed in their generic names will be procured by all government institutions. 

Administrative Order No. 163 s. 2002 (entitled “Implementing Guidelines and Procedures in the Procurement and Requisition of Drugs and Medicines by the Department of Health pursuant to Executive Order No. 49”) provides the procedural bases that ensure requisition of essential medicines by the Government sector and the decision system for the inclusion and deletion of medicines in the Philippine National Drug Formulary (PNDF). 

The Philippine Health Insurance Corporation (PHIC) Board Resolution No. 265 (dated 15. July 1999) and the National Health Insurance Act of 2013 (Republic Act No. 7875 as amended by RA. No. 9241 and RA. No. 10606) provide that the PNDF Volume I shall be the basis for claims reimbursements for medicines both in the private and public sectors for equitable and efﬁcient use of limited resources. 

The more recent RA 9502 enacted in 2008 provides additional power to the President of the Philippines to impose, upon the recommendation of the Secretary of Health, maximum retail prices over medicines that include, among others, the “drugs and medicines that are included in the Philippine National Drug Formulary Essential Drug List.” 

The Philippine National Formulary continues to serve as the national reference for cost- effective and rational selection of the medicines which are vital in achieving optimal population health outcomes. Given the importance of the PNF in the attainment of universal access to quality essential medicines, the systems, procedures and processes to formulate and update the previous issuances, Administrative Order 2012-0023 (Revised Implementing Guidelines for the Philippine National Formulary System) and its addendum AO 2012-0023—A need to be reviewed and enhanced. 

II. OBJECTIVES 

This issuance aims to: 

A. Describe the new systems and procedures for: 

1. the selection of medicines to be included in or deleted from the Essential Drug List hereafter referred to as the National Essential Medicines list; 

2. the development of the PNF manual which integrates the Essential Medicines List and Formulary monographs; and 

3. the promotion of the use of the Formulary among the different levels of healthcare managers and providers and the consumers. 

B. Reconstitute the Formulary COmmittee and describe the implementation arrangements of the Philippine National Formulary System (PNFS). 

III. SCOPE 

This Order shall be applicable to all health facilities, units and ofﬁces of the entire government sector as a basis for drug procurement. It shall also be applicable to the entire health sector (both government and private) as a reference guide for rational use of medicines and as a basis for reimbursement of medicines by the PHIC. 

IV. DEFINITION OF TERMS 

A. Essential Medicines- These are medicines that satisfy the priority health care needs of the population and which are selected based on the evidence of their efﬁcacy, safety and comparative cost-effectiveness. The DOH shall endeavor to make these available and affordable at all times. 

B. Affordability- refers to the cost implications of including the drug in the Formulary expressed as total treatment cost per patient and budget impact to the government. 

C. Budget Impact Analysis- estimates the ﬁnancial consequences of the adoption and diffusion of a new health-care intervention such as drugs/medicines within the local speciﬁc health-care setting context given inevitable resource constraints. 

D. Conﬂict of Interest— a situation created when persons or entities in the public and/or private sectors that have personal, ﬁnancial, or any other interest in the pharmaceutical and/or medical device industry, such as but not limited to, having existing ownership or investment therein, being an ofﬁcer or a member of the Board of Directors of a corporation of a corporation (including its subsidiaries, afﬁliates and branches) or a partner in a partnership engaged therein, and receiving any contribution there from. This includes receiving or accepting any offer or contribution there from. 

E. Cost- effective- a term that is applied to a drug or health technology when its overall health gain to the health system outweighs the opportunity costs of ﬁnding that drug or technology. 

F. Evidence Review Group- composed of content and methods experts who shall evaluate medicines that are proposed to be included into or deleted from the PNF. 

G. Health Technology Assessment- the systematic evaluation of properties, effects, and/or impacts of health technology to inform policy decision making. 

H. Methods Manual— provides the principles and methods of health technology assessment that shall be undertaken to assess medicines that will be included into or deleted from the Formulary. 

I. National Health Program (N HP) — health programs and disease control strategies developed and funded by the Department of Health for the prevention and management of diseases that are of public health importance. 

J. Pharmaceutical Establishment— a sole proprietorship, a partnership, a corporation, an institution, an association, or an organization engaged in the manufacture, importation, exportation, sale, offer for sale, distribution, donation, transfer, use, testing, promotion, advertising, or Sponsorship of health products including the facilities and installations needed for its activities. 

K. Scoping- a process of determining the scope of drug review with relevant stakeholders in terms of the population who will beneﬁt, the comparator or the current standard of care and the relevant health outcomes to be considered. 

L. Systematic Review- a systematic search of all empirical evidence that would meet pre—speciﬁed eligibility criteria in order to answer a Speciﬁc research question. It involves an explicit reproducible methodology to assess the validity of the ﬁndings of the included studies. 

M. Urgent health situation- requiring immediate action to prevent death, permanent disability or a major or irreversible organ dysfunction and for concerns that are of public health importance upon decision and endorsement of the Secretary of Health.

1. The PNFEC shall ensure that any medicine considered for inclusion in the PNF shall be assessed based on its beneﬁt- risk assessment (efﬁcacy and safety), cost—effectiveness affordability and local public health relevance. 

2. The FDA shall provide the initial necessary data to the PNFEC to this effect, i.e. records of all medicines registered in the Philippine market covered with a Certiﬁcate of Product Registration (CPR). The FDA Shall likewise provide data on whether the medicine is available in the Philippine market or is still in the process of being registered. 

3. The PNFEC shall continuously review the list of medicines in the PNF. The PNFEC shall submit to the Assistant Secretary or Undersecretary of Health in charge of PD the list of recommended medicines for inclusion in or deletion from the PNF. Such Shall be published in the DOH-PD website, upon the approval of the Secretary of Health. 

4. The PNF adheres to the essential medicines list concept of the World Health Organization (WHO) which states that “essential medicines are those that satisfy the priority healthcare needs of the population.” As such, the major criteria for the selection of medicines in the PNF are: 

a. Local public health context- the drug addresses a priority disease or unmet health care need as determined by the DOH in consultation with the stakeholders. 

b. Burden of disease and avoidable burden of disease that shall be measured by its frequency, as indicated by its prevalence or incidence, and by its severity, as indicated by its quality—adjusted life years (QALY) or disability-adjusted life years (DALY) or, in their absence, a consensus of experts; 

c. Comparative efﬁcacy and safety relative to the current standard of care or a medicine listed in the PNF indicated for the same condition. This shall be based on pharmacological studies including systematic reviews andfor meta-analysis of Phase III clinical trials; 

d. Comparative cost-effectiveness— as a rule of thumb, the F EC sets an arbitrary threshold of less than or equal to one (1) GDP per capitaper QALY gained or DALY averted when evaluating potentially innovative treatments compared to the current standard of care which include the medicines listed in the PNF; 

e. Affordability of the drug to DOH and Philhealth- pertains not only to the unit cost of the drug but also the treatment cost per patient and the overall potential budget impact if all patients eligible for that treatment are funded by the national government; and 

f. Equity - the drug addresses the disease that places a great burden. on disadvantaged or special populations such as the poor, disabled, children, elderly, women, indigenous peoples that reﬂect the valuesthat should be considered by DOH policymakers as stipulated in existing DOH policies and national laws. 

5. For medicines belonging to the same pharmacologic class, the following preferential factors shall be used in choosing the best possible medicine: 

a. The medicine is the most thoroughly investigated and therefore the best understood with respect to its beneﬁts and risks; 

b. The medicine possesses clinical utility for the treatment of more than one condition or disease; 

c. The medicine has the most favorable pharmacokinetic properties, e.g., factors promoting better compliance or leading to lesser risk in various pathophysiological states; 

d. The medicine has dosage forms that are, easy for the health staff to dispense or that are easily and safely administered to the patient; 

e. The medicine is easy for the patient to take or promotes better compliance among most patients; and 

f. The medicine and its dosage forms have favorable stability under the anticipated local conditions in storage facilities. 

6. The medicines should be formulated as single compounds. Fixed-dose combinations, however, are acceptable only when: 

a. The value of concomitant use of more than one medicine is rational and clinically documented; 

b. At least equally effective or more cost—effective. The combination product is less than or does not exceed that of the sum of the individual products of the active ingredients of the combination. 

c. Plus any of the following: 

i. The combination provides an additive, synergistic and/ or complementary action; 
ii. The combination has no additional adverse drug reactions; and 
iii. The combination provides dosage convenience for better patient compliance. 

7. Criteria for the exclusion or deletion of medicines from the PNF are as follows: 

a. The medicine has been withdrawn from the FDA registry due to safety reasons; 
b. A more effective or equally effective but less toxic medicine becomes available; 
c. In light of new data, the therapeutic efﬁcacy of the medicine is found to be unsatisfactory; 
d. Toxicity, suspected toxicity, potential for abuse and dangerous interactions outweigh the medicine‘s therapeutic value; 
e. The medicine is no longer deemed cost-effective compared to other therapies; 
f. The medicine is a ﬁxed—dose combination that does not satisfy the requirements of A0. 96 S. l 990 and the prescribed criteria of the PNFEC; or 
g. Not affordable to the government (budget impact). 

8. Exemptions 

a. EO No. 49 s.1993 states that only medicines listed in the PNDF shall be procured by all government entities. Requests for exemptions will be considered provided that the medicine proposed for exemption meets all the criteria for exemption. There shall also be a simultaneous application ﬁled by the proponent for inclusion of the medicine in the PNF. 

b. The application for exemption shall have the following as attached documents: 

i. Accomplished proposal form that includes justiﬁcation, a report on disease burden and its ranking relative to the common diseases in the health facility or community; 
ii. Soft/electronic cOpieS of all cited studies and published articles; and 
iii. Other relevant documents (e. g. peer—reviewed local Philippine clinical practice guidelines which provides information on the indication or use of the product (preferred), excerpts from WHO documents or other formularies, etc., including photocopies of such). 

c. Only requests for exemption submitted by the PTC of the requesting facility or the DOH National Health Program shall be accepted. 

d. The request for exemption shall only be granted if it fulﬁlls ALL of the following criteria: 

i. The medicine has proven safety and efﬁcacy. 
ii. There is no other medicine listed in the formulary which is indicated for the same condition or appropriate for the current situation. 
iii. The medicine will be used for an urgent health situation. 

e. Potentially innovative medicines responding to a public health priority or where there are no other strategies or treatment to address a disease which is of grave public health importance may be granted an exemption provided that they have been tested in terms of clinical performance and safety, and have a certiﬁcate of product registration from the FDA. 

f. The Undersecretary or Assistant Secretary in charge of PD shall approve or disapprove the request based on the recommendation of the PNFEC. In cases where the procurement would amount to Php 500,000 and above, the Secretary of Health shall be the approving authority. 

g. The validity of the exemption is good for a period of one year or as prescribed, unless an adverse decision has been rendered regarding the application for inclusion. 

Medicines not registered in the Philippines may be considered for exemption or inclusion in the PNF provided that they are needed to address a public health priority as determined by the Secretary of Health upon the recommendation of the PNFEC. Provided also that the medicine is registered in any stringent national regulatory authority (i.e., accredited by the Pharmaceutical Inspection Convention and Pharmaceutical Inspection Co-operation Scheme (jointly referred to as PIC/S)).
