<subject>SUBJECT: Guidelines in the Management of Adverse Reactions to Anti-filarial Chemotherapy</subject>

<body>
I. BACKGROUND/RATIONALE

The knowledge of the pathogenesis of Lymphatic Filariasis has improved remarkably during the past years. This has led to the improvement of the diagnostic and therapeutic schemes being used and the possibility of eliminating this dreadful and debilitating disease.

The Philippines is committed to eliminate lymphatic filariasis. In partnership with all the stakeholders (DILG/LGUs, NGOs, private organizations & communities). The Department of Health has worked towards attaining the main goals of treatment for Lymphatic Filariasis namely: 1. interrupting transmission and eliminating the disease, and 2. alleviating the sufferings of those infested and having chronic manifestations. The Standard Selective Treatment with Diethylcarbamazine Citrate (DEC) has been used for many years (which is also being used in most other endemic countries) to halt transmission. This can only be effective if all people living in endemic areas will be subjected to Nocturnal Blood Examination. However in reality, only few people avail of such test because blood has to be collected at night. This resulted in the failure to contain the spread of infection. Now, therefore, with recent advances, health workers can now select the appropriate treatment strategy suited for a community-managed program of their local situation.

A review of the program since its creation in 1963 has shown that the problem of adverse reactions to anti-filarial drugs (ADRs) has affected the compliance to drug therapy. These guidelines are thus being issued for a. effective management of adverse reactions, b. prevention of progression of severe complications and c. widening the scope of exclusion criteria for use of combination drugs.

II. OBJECTIVE/PURPOSE:

To guide public and private providers to effectively manage adverse reactions to anti-filarial drugs.

III. COVERAGE/SCOPE:

This order will apply to all public and private providers in areas conducting treatment for filariasis.

IV. GENERAL GUIDELINES AND PROCEDURES:

A. Drugs

The known anti-filarial drugs that are listed In the Philippine National Drug Formulary are as follows:

1. Diethylcarbamazine Citrate (DEC) - shows activity against microfilaria and adult worms. It is rapidly absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract and reaches its peak levels in the blood 1-2 hrs after an oral dose of 6 mg/kg body wt. The half life in the blood is only 10-12 hrs.

2. Albendazole - Albendazole is one of the family of benzimidazole compounds and was registered for human use in 1981. Albendazole has an exceptional safety profile and is a highly effective treatment for a wide variety of intestinal parasitic infections and systemic conditions. Following a standard 400mg dose, plasma levels of albendazole sulfoxide, the active metabolite peak around 3 hours after dosing in fasted patients. Urinary excretion of the sulfoxide moiety is low and elimination appears to occur in the bile as conjugates. The half life is around 12 hours.

B. Treatment

There are two treatment regimens for anti-filarial drugs that are being used in the country, namely:

1. Mass Treatment- giving the drugs to all population living in established filariasis-endemic areas whether negative or positive for the infection on annual basis for a minimum of five years.

2. Standard Selective Treatment - giving anti-filarial drugs to individuals found to be positive for microfilaria using the standard dosage of the anti-filarial drug being used.

C. Usual Adverse Reactions to the Combination Drug

Adverse reactions associated with anti-filarial drugs are usually mild and transient. Reactions are usually felt by persons with high levels of microfilaria in the blood. Reactions maybe either localized or systemic. These include:

1. abdominal pain
2. headache
2. dizziness
3. fever
4. vomiting
5. joint/muscle pain
6. diarrhea
7. nausea
8. fatigue
9. rashes
10. presence of nodules

D. General Management of Adverse Reactions

The rapid killing of the microfilarial parasites releases enough antigen into the system to overwhelm the modulating effects of the host's immune system and to induce a variety of side reactions. The following are the recommended approach in the initial management of adverse reactions to selective or mass treatment with anti-filarial drugs:

1. Get the clinical history. Make a rapid clinical assessment and manage accordingly.

a. Gastrointestinal Symptoms (abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting & diarrhea)

• Give analgesics
• Manage dehydration (oral/Intravenous Fluid, as indicated)
• Give antispasmodic or antiemetic if necessary

b. Fever, headache pain & inflammation (usually in the inguinal area & the enlarged scrotum)

• Give analgesic/anti-inflammatory drugs
• Apply cold compress in the affected area
• Give antibiotics if indicated
• Advise the patient to rest. This intervention is provided to prevent the inflammation around the dead worm that can spread towards the foot or hand causing a tender cord but this is transitory.

c. Dizziness

• Advise rest
• Give anti-vertigo drugs, if necessary

If any of the above symptom progresses or persists beyond 24 hrs, refer the patient to the appropriate health facility. If an unexpected reaction or an Severe Adverse Reaction (SADRs) is observed, refer immediately to the appropriate health facility

E. Exclusion Criteria

The combination drugs is ABSOLUTELY CONTRAINDICATED to pregnant women, children below 2 yrs old, seriously ill, patients with kidney and cardiac disorder. Individuals with asthma, seizure disorders and severe malnutrition should be given with caution.
