<subject>Subject: Guidelines for Establishment of Performance-Based Budget for Public Health</subject>

<body>
I. BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE

Pursuant to AO 2005-0023, the DOH adopted FOURmula ONE for Health as the implementation framework for health sector reforms. The specific objectives of FOURmula One for Health are to: (l) secure more, better and sustained financing for health; (2) assure the quality and affordability of health goods and services; (3) ensure access to and availability of essential and basic health packages; and (4) improve performance of the health system.

FOURmula One for Health organizes the critical reform initiatives into four sets of instruments that must be effectively applied in order to influence the performance of a high decentralized public health care system and local health care markets. These instruments are financing, regulation, service delivery, and governance.

On financing, AO 2005-0023 has established strategies that include coordinating national and local spending, focusing direct subsidies to priority programs, and adopting a performance based financing system. Specifically, these strategies call for (a) a sectorwide approach to overall management of total health investments; (b) focusing direct subsidies from national and local governments from personal and curative care to basic and essential public health goods and services commonly used by the poor; and (c) a shift from historical and incremental budgeting system into one that is performance based.

On service delivery, AO 2005-0023 has adopted the following strategies to reduce public health threats: (l) undertaking disease-free zones initiative -areas where diseases such as malaria, filariasis, schistosomiasis, rabies, leprosy and vaccine-preventable diseases are major health problems shall be identified and targeted for intensive campaigns to eliminate these diseases as public health threats; (2) implementing intensified disease prevention and control strategies -Intensified disease prevention and control strategies for other priority diseases such as tuberculosis, HIV/AIDS and other communicable diseases shall be undertaken in intensified disease control zones where the greatest impact from health investments could be derived; and (3) enhancing health promotion and disease surveillance to reinforce the disease-free zones initiative and the intensified disease prevention and control strategies, enhanced health promotion and disease surveillance activities shall be undertaken, and to ensure that the targets for disease elimination, prevention and control are attained. Moreover, health promotion interventions shall be directed at the prevention and control of health hazards and health risk-taking behaviors, particularly those associated with lifestyle related diseases such as cardiovascular diseases, cancer, diabetes mellitus and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease among others.

Because of the public good nature of public health services and programs, these should be financed by the government. Public health programs are more cost effective and can benefit a larger segment of the population. Because it is financed by the government which has limited resources, spending for public health requires appropriate mechanism to ensure that public health programs are prioritized and managed efficiently. Thus performance-based budgeting system needs to be adopted.

This Administrative Order provides guidelines for prioritizing public health programs, and for adoption of a performance-based budget allocation and execution for priority public health programs including the implementation of performance-based awards to LGUs.

II. GOALS

The ultimate goal in the implementation of performance-based budgeting of priority public health programs is to improve health outcomes as follows:

1. To eliminate leprosy, schistosomiasis, filariasis, malaria, rabies as public health problem in specific areas

2. To improve health outcomes related to Vaccine Preventable Diseases, TB, HIV/AIDS, emerging infections

3. To improve reproductive health outcomes through maternal and child health programs (MMR, IMR, U5MR, TFR, CPR)

4. To improve lifestyle and risk management (anti-smoking, safe water, sanitation, among others)

III. OBJECTIVES

The specific objective is to provide guidelines for:

1. Prioritizing public health programs over time

2. Progressively allocating commodities for priority public health programs

3. Linking budget subsidies of DOH offices to specific outputs and outcomes for targeted reforms in public health programs.

4. Linking DOH assistance and transfers to LGUs to specific outputs and outcomes in public health programs that promote functional inter-local coordination on health.

IV. SCOPE AND COVERAGE

This AO shall apply to all DOH offices, and its attached agencies involved in critical activities related to public health thrusts and reforms.

V. GENERAL GUIDELINES

A. All priority public health programs that contribute directly or indirectly to the attainment of desired health outcomes shall be subjected to PBB. These shall be periodically reviewed and changed as outcomes are achieved and as need arises.

B. All programs, projects and activities under these priority public health programs shall be subjected to PBB. These shall include the existing functions from policy, standards and systems development, monitoring and evaluation at the central and regional levels as well as provision of technical assistance to and leveraging the performance of the LGUs.

C. Critical commodities shall be progressively allocated under the PBB on the basis of pre-defined criteria. A strategy for more efficient targeting and allocating of these commodities shall be developed for specific population groups by economic quintile.

D. PBB shall consist of three categories of fund schemes to be applied at all DOH levels:

1. Baseline Public Health Commodity Fund (BPHCF): This shall be comprised of funds for the procurement of PH commodities that will be allocated and distributed to the LGUs to achieve national public health targets and desired outcomes. The BPHCF shall be protected from any cuts, but shall be subject to performance benchmarks.

2. Public Health Programs Fund (PHPF): This shall include funds for policy and systems development and for provision of technical assistance by DOH offices to LGUs and health sector partners. The PHPF shall also include funds for fixed administrative/ utility costs for sustaining operations. The PHPF can be subject to cuts, based on agreed increments and agreed performance benchmarks.

3. Public Health Development Program Fund (PHDPF): This fund will comprise of savings generated or unallocated from the PHPF, grant and loan inputs from the ODA and funds shifted from hospitals to preventive and promotive health services. This fund will be used to provide incentives for early and timely accomplishment of annual benchmarks set over the medium term period.

E. PBB shall ensure development of a policy environment conducive for institutionalizing functional interlocal health zones.

F. The Performance-Based Budget for Public Health shall only apply to MOOE and Capital Outlay expense items from government budgets, donor grants or loans.

VI SPECIFIC GUIDELINES

A. Prioritization of Public Health Programs

1. Priority public health programs shall be identified on the basis of burden of disease, equity, economic efficiency, and cost effectiveness (See Annex A).

2. In order to focus limited health resources for greater impact, the following Millennium Development Goal (MDG) and Fl target disease shall be prioritized as follows:

a. Priority Level 1-Diseases of high impact and prevalence such as TB, vaccine preventable diseases and MCH concerns
b. Priority Level 2- All other MDG / F1 priority diseases such as malaria, HIV/AIDS leprosy, schistosomiasis, filariasis, rabies, environmental health risks among others

3. Prioritization of national health programs shall be reviewed every two years depending on evaluated need and capacity in the health sector, and after consultation with stakeholders.

4. In addition to national health program priorities, DOH shall also take into account specific diseases which are endemic in certain LGUs.

B. Progressive allocation of Public Health Commodities

1. The provision of commodities for priority programs shall be based on populations in need or at risk and other factors.

(See Annex B).

2. The key criteria for allocation by the DOH, through NCDPC, of public health commodities per region shall be based on regional poverty indices. Further, the key criteria for allocation of public health commodities by the CHDs to the intended beneficiaries in the LGUs shall be based on local poverty indices.

3. The DOH shall build capacity for more efficient targeting and provision of public health commodities for more effective coverage of the population with public health commodities. Strategies for providing full subsidy of public health commodities for the poor shall be sustained, to the fullest extent of current capacity and supply. Strategies, which may be on partial or no subsidy basis, for specific population groups that demand commodities and have the capacity to pay for these shall also be developed.

ANNEX A.

Considerations in Prioritization of Public Health Programs

In a dynamic setting associated with (and resulting from) health sector reform, there is a need to periodically review priority public health programs. Overall priorities may change as a result of success (or failure) in addressing a specific priority program. New information may become available that would allow a more rational ranking of priorities. Reestablishing priorities in the light of changes in the health system and in the general environment together with new information shall take into account a set of interrelated criteria for determining priorities that include the following:

1. Burden of disease considerations. Prioritize public health interventions based on current and changing disease patterns as measured by prevalence and incidence data in view of the lack of information to estimate DALY or similar measures.

2. Equity considerations. Focus public health interventions on the poor.

3. Economic efficiency considerations:

a. Public goods. Pure public goods, such as the provision of public health information, should received more public attention (and probably more public resources) than private goods.

b. Externalities. If externalities are large, public attention may be required, and in some cases public financing or even public provision is justified.

c. Risk pooling. Some health conditions are rare and too costly for most uninsured individuals to pay out-of-pocket. There are some characteristics of health insurance markets (moral hazard and adverse selection) that will most likely make these markets fail without some element of public intervention. Public intervention, therefore, to create insurance markets is justified on efficiency terms.

4. Cost-effectiveness. Prioritize public health interventions that are effective given their cost in achieving a given target improvements in health outcomes. Priority shall be given to those needed interventions that are doable and backed by sufficient groundwork and buy-in from implementation partners. Success in achieving targets in one program could promote the achievement of targets in other programs, e.g., family planning and child health. Greater priority should be giving to those critical interventions that strengthen linkages across public health interventions.

ANNEX B

Considerations in Allocation of Public Health Commodities

In order to improve commodity allocation to target those most in need, the following may be taken into consideration:

1. Current approaches to estimating commodity requirements/target population

Current approaches to estimating commodity requirements include using the "population at risk" concept for programs of EPI and programs involving mass treatment (i.e., malaria, filariasis and STH) and "population in need" for programs involving selective treatment (i.e. malaria, filariasis, rabies, schistosomiasis, TB and leprosy).

For population at risk, estimates of commodity requirements also involved setting ideal coverage rates. For population in need, estimates of commodity requirements involved estimating expected cases.

2. Refinements to the current estimates of commodity requirements

The following factors needs to be taken into account in refining multi-year national estimates of commodity requirements for priority public health programs:

a. Population growth. Data on population projection by age and sex are provided by the National Statistics Office. For planning purposes, National Statistical Coordination Board (N SCB) recommends the use of the medium series. However, the assumptions in the medium series may not be achieved, and the more likely population projection would be the high series assumption, implying a larger population for each year in the projection period. The difference may not be large within the five year planning period.

b. Epidemiology or disease burden, including time frame for elimination or control of particular diseases. Reduction in commodity requirements is expected if target coverage is achieved and sustained for a number of years, which for some diseases would take from three to five years (e.g., three years for soil transmitted helminthiasis and malaria, and five years for filariasis, and schistosomiasis). An effective surveillance system is needed to provide timely data.

c. Ideal target versus minimum target to prevent an outbreak. Should commodity requirements be estimated to achieve the ideal target coverage (e.g., for EPI 95%) or in the case of budget constraints, to shoot for a minimum target coverage to prevent an outbreak (e.g., for EPI 80%)?

d. Across the board versus phased geographic interventions in endemic areas. Should commodity requirements be estimated to reach all endemic areas at ideal coverage or in the case of budget constraints adopt a phase geographic targeting over a certain period of time such that some endemic areas are scheduled for

e. Poverty rate. Estimates of the poverty rate are provided by the NSCB every three years based on data from the Family Income and Expenditure Survey (FIES). Useful data are also provided by national health and demographic surveys (National Demographic and Health Survey (NDHS) every five years and Family Planning Survey annually except in the year when NDHS is conducted) that provide maternal and child care and family planning data by wealth status of households. For certain commodities (child vaccines), estimates could exclude households in the high income quintiles on the assumption that these households would typically obtain services from private providers. (For EPI, only 70% of the eligible children for immunization belong to the three lowest quintiles. This rise to 85% of eligible children if only the highest income quintile households is excluded). For other commodities where it is known that the commodity is not available from the private sector (e.g., praziquantel for schistosomiasis treatment), estimation of commodity requirements may be made based on target population at risk or in need irrespective of wealth status. However, it can be argued that households in the higher income quintiles are less likely to be exposed to infection than poorer household on account of occupation and sanitation practices.

f. Public sector coverage and private market share. Commodity estimates based on the assumption that all services will be provided solely by the public sector will overestimate commodity requirements if a segment of the client population obtain services from the private sector. Data on the share of the private sector in the health service market are generally not available. However, data on wealth status of households (by quintiles) can be used to estimate public sector coverage by assuming that households in either the highest or the second highest quintile would typically obtain services/information from private sector providers/dispensers. Estimates of commodity requirements of the public sector could thus be refined with this assumption regarding market share in mind.

g. Public sector performance (coverage rate and utilization rate) and projected improvements. Commodity estimates based on the assumption that target coverage/utilization rates are fully met will overestimate commodity requirements since typically such targets are typically not consistently met. Achieving additional performance towards the target coverage/utilization rates not only imply commodity estimates to achieve the targets but also other resource requirements to facilitate achievement of the targets. Since the delivery of services is undertaken by LGUs, these additional resource requirements to generate additional performance can be provided through a performance-based grants or awards system (to be discussed below).

h. Buffer stock. The commodity requirements over five years should avoid including a yearly requirement of additional standard percentage to cover for the buffer stock. Such an approach will lead to a compounding effect and would imply having a one year buffer stock by the end of a four year cycle.
