<subject>SUBJECT: ADOPTION OF FOURmula ONE FOR HEALTH (F1) OPERATIONS MANUAL FOR CONVERGENCE PROVINCES</subject>


<body>

I. BACKGROUND

The Department of Health formulated the FOURmula One for Health (Fl) as the implementing framework for health sector reforms required to address inequity and inefficiency and achieve the country’s health goals as stated in the National Objectives for Health in particular and the Millennium Development Goals in general. The main strategy is for the DOH to assist Fl. convergence sites by providing targeted support and intentioned assistance to selected provinces in the undertaking of integrated implementation of the reform components. A convergence province develops a Province-Wide Investment Plan for Health (PIPH) with the assistance of the DOH and. using the F1 framework. The PIPH serves as the province’s medium term health plan. Reforms are to be implemented under a sector—wide approach, which encompasses a management perspective that covers the Province’s entire health sector and an investment portfolio that encompasses all sources of funds.

For the first 16 convergence provinces, the collaboration between the DOH and each of these provinces in implementing the respective PIPHs has been formalized through a Memorandum of Agreement (MOA) that defined the roles and responsibilities of each of the two parties. An annual Service Level Agreement is also signed between the DOH and each of these provinces to define the outputs and performance milestones to be reached, and amount of funds to be provided to the provinces. Implementing guidelines for operationalization of the PIPHs is therefore in order.

2. OBJECTIVE

To adopt the Pl Operations Manual for Convergence Provinces version 1.1 dated November 2007, as the implementing guidelines for operationalization of the PIPHs of the convergence provinces.

3. SCOPE OF APPLICATION

The F1 Operations Manual for Convergence Provinces provides guidelines for operationalization of the PIPHs of F1 convergence provinces. It also provides speciﬁc guidelines for the first 16 convergence provinces, in particular specific guidelines pertaining to the grant from the European Commission and the counterpart funds from DOH sourced from a World Bank loan. These ﬁrst 16 convergence provinces are the Provinces of Ifugao, Mountain Province, Ilocos Norte, Pangasinan, Nueva Vizcaya, Oriental Mindoro, Romblon, Capiz, Negros Oriental, Biliran, Eastern Samar, Southern Leyte, Misamis Occidental, North Cotabato, South Cotabato, and Agusan Del Sur.

This Manual is an evolving document and lessons from implementation will be utilized to update the Manual if the need arises.

4. GENERAL GUIDELINES

To fully achieve the objectives of F1, the attached F1 Operations Manual for Convergence Provinces shall be adopted in the implementation of PIPHs of the F1 convergence provinces.

5. EFFECTIVITY

This order shall take effect immediately.
