OFFICE OF THE SECRETARY 

 

I. Rationale/Background 

Effective national food control systems are essential to protect the health and safety of consumers. The global environment for food trade places emphasizes on strengthening food control systems and to implement and enforce risk-based food control strategies. 

The Department of Health (DOH) through the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is mandated by Republic Act (RA) No. 10611, otherwise known as the Food Safety Act of 2013, to bear the speciﬁc responsibility of ensuring the safety of all food processing and product packaging activities, among others and to develop and issue appropriate authorizations in the form of a license and certificate or registration that would cover establishments, facilities engaged in production and distribution of products. 

The FDA through the Center for Food Regulation and Research (CFRR), per RA 9711, shall adopt, support, establish, institutionalize, improve and maintain structures, processes, mechanisms and initiatives that are aimed, directed and designed to protect and promote the right to health of the Filipino people. It shall implement a performance-based food safety control management system which shall include, among others: a) the development of food standards and regulations; b) post-market monitoring; c) enforcement of Hazard Analysis Critical Control Points (HACCP) and other risk-based control measures; d) strong participation in Codex and other international standard setting bodies, e) communication of risks and development of interactive exchange among stakeholders; f) establishment and strengthening of food laboratories; g) development of a database on food-home illness and epidemiological data; h) strengthening R&D capabilities food safety and quality standards; and i) certiﬁcation of food safety inspectors. Consistent with international food safety measures, FDA is adopting a risk—based approach on product and establishment risk categorization focusing on preventive, rather than corrective strategies. 

Consistent with this mandate, the FDA shall ensure food safety through the imposition of food quality standards in the country. Thus, the issuance of this Administrative Order on the Licensing of Food Establishments, and Registration of Processed Food to issue appropriate authorizations in the form of a permit, license and certiﬁcate of registration or compliance that would cover establishments, facilities engaged in packing, holding or producing food for consumption in accordance with the mandated issuances of regulatory agencies issuing such authorizations.
