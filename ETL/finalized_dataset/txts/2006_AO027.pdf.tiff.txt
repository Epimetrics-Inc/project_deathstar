<subject>Subject: Implementing Guidelines for Performance-Based Budgeting for DOH Retained Hospitals</subject>

<body>
I. RATIONALE

The intrinsic goals of the Philippine health care system are improved health outcomes, responsiveness to client needs, and fairness in the distribution of health outcomes as well as the operational and financial means to achieving them. The achievement of these goals, as enunciated by Fourmula One for Health (F1), will be through its four main thrusts of health financing, health service delivery, regulation and health system governance.

Government hospitals are central to the execution of these strategies. Aside from its mandate of direct service delivery, particularly for the poor, government hospitals are also mandated to undertake research for the advancement of medical knowledge, provide training to ensure adequate and appropriate health human resource, as well as inF1uence to other health facilities in the area to improve quality of care and ensure competitive pricing of services.

Funding for the operation, maintenance and improvement of government hospitals constitute more than 90% of the DOH budget for personal health care, which in turn accounts for about 60-70% of the total DOH expenditures. About 60% of the DOH hospital budget goes to personal services GS) while 40% goes to maintenance and other operating expenses (MOOE). In 2003, hospitals have been allowed to retain revenues which in 2005 totaled more than a billion pesos or greater than 25% of the total MOOE in the sector.

However, the absence of systems to clearly link hospital performance with budgetary allocations means that the return value for the sizable investments on hospitals cannot be assured. For example, the lack of financial incentives to install good budgetary planning and control systems have not encouraged hospitals to fully realize their revenue generating potentials and shift from DOH-dependent budgets to internally generated sources of income such as social insurance reimbursements, user fee charges and other extra budgetary sources.

Performance-based budgeting refers to the process by which DOH shall split funding for the hospital MOOE into several portions, the releases of which will be based on hospital performance relative to pre-agreed performance measures. This reallocation scheme has great potential for providing incentives for solid institutional performance, motivating hospital staff members to perform better, rewarding effective business and financial management practices, securing hospital autonomy and improving the competitiveness of government hospital services. This will enhance capacity of government hospitals to inF1uence the quality and pricing of other hospitals in their area and to improve services for the population, particularly the marginalized sectors of the society.

II. OBJECTIVES

A. Improve the quality of hospital services consistent with the core components of the Continuous Quality Improvement program of the DOH

B. Ensure continued access to hospital services by clients, especially the marginalized sectors of the society, by securing self-sustainable hospital operations

C. Promote optimum and efficient use of hospital resources consistent with the principles of sound business and financial management

D. Improve allocative efficiency of the health care system by shifting national government subsidies away from personal health care and curative services towards public health care

E. Link financial burden of DOH Hospitals' financing with incentives for the attainment of clearly defined performance outputs and outcomes

III. COVERAGE

This Order shall provide the guidelines to implement the performance based budgeting system in the allocation of subsidies to all DOH hospitals.

IV. GENERAL GUIDELINES

A. In order to enhance allocative efficiency of the DOH budget and to augment public health funds, funds used for hospital services shall be shared with preventive and promotive services. DOH Budget for CY 2006-2010 shall be allocated to achieve no more than 70% financing for hospitals and no less than 17% for public health.

B. There shall be Performance Based Allocation scheme for all DOH hospitals to improve technical efficiency of DOH Budget. It shall only apply to subsidies for the Maintenance, Operating, and Other Expenses (MOOE) of the hospital. Personnel Services (PS) of DOH hospitals shall not be linked to performance benchmarks.

C. For purposes of improving allocative efficiency, a Public Health Development Fund Pool (PHDFP) shall be established comprising of funds from national subsidies to DOH hospitals. This shall be used to support priority public health F1 programs.

D. To improve technical efficiency, the following Fund Pools shall be established:

1. Basic Allocation Fund (BAF): This fund shall cover for funding of a substantial part of the MOOE of a hospital that will ensure its continuous operations. This fund shall not be linked to performance benchmarks.

2. Performance Based Operation Fund (PBOF): This fund shall serve as an incentive program anchored on the ability of the hospital to demonstrate achievements on the following performance benchmarks:

• Administrative
• Utilization Rate
• Quality
• Social Support
• Efficiency

3. Health Facilities Enhancement Fund (HFEF): This fund shall provide necessary investment support to DOH hospitals which will be made available for strategic hospital infrastructure development and equipment upgrade. Funding support shall come from any unallocated funds obtained from the Performance Based Operations Fund. An amount no more than 10% of HFEF shall be given to FICO, and NCHFD as funds to enhance operationalization of PBB subject to the satisfactory execution of provision of this Order and or upon discretion of management.

E. The ExeCom shall prescribe key performance benchmarks and measures relevant to attain F1 Medium Term Goals through Annual Planning Guidelines of the Department.

F. No new funds shall be made available to DOH hospitals in order to maintain allocative efficiency in DOH. However, should there be any new fund above the current baseline budget made available to DOH hospitals, it shall be used as a one time lump sum augmentation fund for the capital outlay of specific DOH hospitals. Any DOH hospital that receives this augmentation fund shall recompense the amount through automatic deductions from their Basic Allocation Fund over a period of five (5) years. This annual automatic deductions shall be added to the Health Facilities Enhancement Fund or the Public Health Fund Pool subject to management approval and as long as it is within the macro-allocative target of DOH.

G. The Performance Based Allocation scheme shall be anchored on full retention and use of income generated by DOH hospitals as an important element in achieving incentives and outcomes desired for DOH hospitals.

H. The National Expenditure Program (NEP) 2006 shall be the basis of the computation for fund allocation for DOH hospitals.

I. Performance Based Budgeting shall be implemented from CY 2006-2010 subject to an annual review and evaluation.

V. IMPLEMENTATION MECHANISM

A. Fund Allocation Schemes

1. A fixed amount equivalent to 5% of the MOOE budget per NEP 2006 shall be automatically deducted annually. It shall constitute the PHDFP for F1 programs from 2007 to 2010. Annual allocation of the fund to F1 programs shall be based on performance benchmarks for the public health programs set by the DOH.

2. Seventy percent (70%) of the net MOOE budget of hospitals per NEP 2006 shall represent the BAF for each hospital for fiscal year 2007-2010.

3. The remaining 30% of the net MOOE per NEP 2006 will be allocated to the hospitals for 2007 based on self assessment report presented in Annex A of this document, and based on the following major benchmark performance measures for 2008-2010:

a. Efficiency/Utilization Rate (base index of 60%)
b. Quality (base index of 20%)
c. Social Support (base index of 20%)

4. The unallocated amount from the PBOF shall comprise the HFEF. It shall be accessed on a competitive basis upon submission of proposals.

B. Key Performance Benchmark Measures
