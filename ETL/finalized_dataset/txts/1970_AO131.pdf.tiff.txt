<subject>SUBJECT: Regulation Part C-3.2: Drugs: Prohibition of the Use of More Than One Name for a Given Formulation.</subject>

<body>
The practice of using several brand names for a given pharmaceutical specialty formulation serves only to confuse the practising physicial who is already deluged with all kinds of names, considering the innumerable quantity of different categories of drugs in the market.

Such confusion may lead to errors in dispensing on the part of pharmacists and is therefore not in the best interest of the consumer.

The purpose of this regulation is to reduce the number of pharmaceutical specialties to a minimum compatible with the needs of the medical profession and the consuming public.

C - 3.2.1 It is hereby prohibited for a manufacturer, drug department or person to use more than one branda or commercial name for a given pharmaceutical specialty formulation registered in their name.

Likewise, a pharmaceutical product with a formulation which is significantly similar to one already approved for registration by the same manufacturer, drug department or person, will not be accepted for registration.

3.2.2 The registration of pharmaceutical specialties belonging to the same manufacturer, drug department or person having the same formulation and dosage form is hereby cancelled except the first which was registered at the earliest, provided, however, that the manufacturer, drug department or person so informs the Food and Drug Administration which name they prefer to retain.

3.2.3 Any manufacturer, drug department or person, who intentionally or otherwise registers a pharmaceutical specialty formulation under a different name but of same dosage form of one previously registered, is subject to Section 19(a) of R.A. 3720 for misleading representation, and Section 11(a) of the same Act.

3.2.4 This regulation shall take effect thirty days after publication in the Official Gazette.
