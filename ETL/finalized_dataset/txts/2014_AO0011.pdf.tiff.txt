SUBJECT: Policies and Guidelines on the Implementation of Surveillance in Post Extreme Emergencies and Disasters (SPEED) 

I. BACKGROUND 

Decision-makers and program managers need timely, appropriate and quality information during emergencies to enable them to plan properly the most efﬁcient and effective health emergency response with the objective of reducing preventable deaths and morbidities related to disasters. 

The Department of Health was challenged by the seemingly lack of available and immediate information in 2009 after the country was hit by Tropical Storm Ondoy, and Typhoons Pepeng and Santi. Thousands of leptospirosis cases resulting in hundreds of deaths were reported. In response to the leptospirosis outbreak in flood—affected areas, the Department of Health asked technical assistance from the Global Outbreak and Alert Response Network (GOARN) through the World Health Organization. 

The need for a stronger information management system in emergencies and disasters was reinforced by recommendations from both the GOARN Team and the Health Sector 

Response Post-Incident Evaluation to Tropical Storm Ondoy, and Typhoons Pepeng and Santi. The two reports identiﬁed the need for an effective early' warning system that shall provide the necessary inputs for appropriate and timely response. As a result, the Surveillance in Post Extreme Emergencies and Disasters (SPEED) system was conceptualized and developed. 

Actual experiences where SPEED was activated also showed signiﬁcant data on health conditions that provided early warning to health emergency managers and decision makers. In September 2011, suspected measles cases, injuries, and diarrhea cases in the different evacuation centers in the aftermath of Typhoon Pedring and Tropical Storm Quiel were detected early, monitored, and immediately addressed. Likewise, during the response to Tropical Storm Sendong in December 2011, SPEED facilitated the timely consolidation and analysis of health conditions in the evacuation centers of Cagayan de-Oro and Iligan Cities —~ suspected leptospirosis cases were caught within the ﬁrst week prompting the conduct of appropriate interventions for the early containment of an outbreak. 

SPEED is hereby adopted to address the aforementioned concerns during emergencies and disasters and meet other future challenges. This administrative order provides the framework and policy to guide the health sector in the implementation and sustainability of SPEED. 


II. OBJECTIVES A. General To provide policy and guidelines in the institutionalization of SPEED at all levels of health emergency and management response. 

B. Specific 

1. To establish, integrate and sustain an early warning system through the use of SPEED in all health facilities at all levels and identiﬁed evacuation centers. 

2. To capacitate health workers and other stakeholders involved in emergency management for the early detection of both physical and mental health conditions which will be used as inputs for appropriate interventions. 

3. To deﬁne roles and functions of DOH ofﬁces, Local Government Units and partner agencies in the implementation of SPEED.
