<subject>SUBJECT: Amendment to Administrative Order 2008-0008 the Rules
and Regulations Governing the Regulation of Blood Service Facilities dated May 2, 2008</subject>

I. RATIONALE

This Amendment is issued to strengthen the existing Blood Services Networks and improve the delivery of safe adequate accessible and affordable blood supply to health facilities including those providing Basic and Comprehensive Emergency Obstetrical and Neonatal Care (B/CEmONC) services. Safe blood supply is one of the five (5) critical parameters of Functionality of these health facilities providing B/CEmONC services for the rapid reduction of Maternal Mortality Ratio (MMR) to attain the Philippine Government’s commitment for the Millennium Development Goal (MDG) 5.

Starting last January 1, 2010, the regulation of the new categories of Blood Service Facilities took effect per AO 2008—0008 dated May 2, 2008. The four (4) new categories of Blood Service Facilities are the Hospital Blood Banks, the Blood Centers, the Blood Collection Units and Blood Stations.

However, annually for 2010 and for 2011, the Program Management of the National Voluntary Blood Services Program (NVBSP) had recommended that the Blood Banks of Level 3 and Level 4 Government and Private Hospitals continue blood collection from volunteer blood donors, blood testing for infectious agents and comp ent processing. This is mainly premised on the situation where Level 3 and Level hospitals which have higher service capability and bed capacity are expected to havehigh blood need. On the other hand, for efﬁciency, the smaller hospitals (Level 1 and Level 2) and other health facilities administering blood transfusion were recommended to be part of the Blood Services Networks where blood products will be supplied by designated Blood Centers under the Philippine Red Cross, DOH or LGU instead of establishing and maintaining a high capital intensive and operationally costly blood banks.

Joint implementation of these two (2) parallel tracks (i.e. Hospital Blood Banks and Blood Centers) is deemed to better attain adequacy and availability of safe blood supply for patient safety and quality care.

To support the NVBSP—recommendation for hospital blood banks of
Level 3 and Level 4 private and government hospitals to continue blood collection from volunteer blood donors, blood testing and component processing, there is a need to amend Section X. Transitory Provision of AO 2008-0008.

 
II. AMENDMENT TO Section X. TRANSITORY PROVISIONS (AO 2008—0008
dated May 2, 2008)

Hospital Blood Banks of Level 3 and Level 4 Private and Government Hospitals may continue blood collection from volunteer blood donors; blood testing using the NVBSP recommended methodologies and component processing.

Said Hospital Blood Banks must comply with the regulatory requirements for said services in addition to the hospital blood bank licensing requirements already stated in A0 2008-0008.

III. EFFECTIVITY

The Amendment shall take effect ﬁfteen (15) days after publication in newspaper of general circulation.
