I. RATIONALE/ BACKGROUND 

Water treatment systems used in dialysis are a critical factor in the overall care received by dialysis patients. They also provide one of the greatest hazards if not functioning properly. Water used in dialysis requires additional treatment to minimize patient exposure to potential microbiologic and chemical contaminants that may be present in drinking or tap water. Water puriﬁcation systems are designed to remove metals (e.g. "aluminum, copper, zinc, magnesium), electrolytes (e.g. calcium, sodium, ﬂuoride, chlorine, sulphate), bacteria and pyrogens from feed or raw water. 

The potential adverseclinical effects of inadequate water purification include fever, anemia, bone disease, hemolysis, metabolic acidosis, nausea, vomiting, neurological deterioration, pyrogenic reactions and death. The desire to improve treatment outcomes has led to the application of more stringent standards for the microbiologic purity of dialysis ﬂuid and to the introduction of ultraclean dialysis ﬂuid into clinical practice. 

In this regard, the Department of Health (DOH) through the Bureau of Health Facilities and Services (BF HS) formulated the following guidelines to ensure the safety of water treatment systems into each and every HDC which shall provide ultraclean dialysis ﬂuid in accordance with DOH Administrative Order (A.O.) No. 2012 — 0001 “New Rules and Regulations Governing the Licensure and Regulation of Dialysis Facilities in the Philippines”. 

II. OBJECTIVE 

This Order sets the guidelines to carry out the provisions of Section V. B. 2. c. 1. b. on ‘Water Treatment Area” and Section V. B. 2. g. 4. — 6. on ‘Environmental Management” pursuant to A0. No. 2012 -— 0001 entitled “New Rules and Regulations Governing the icensure and Regulation of Dialysis Facilities in the Philippines”. 

III. SCOPE OF APPLICATION 

This Order applies to all DOH licensed dialysis facilities, DOH accredited laboratories with capability for microbiological and chemical analyses of water in HDC, BHFS and CHD. 

IV. DEFINITION OF TERMS 

For purposes of this Order, the following terms and acronyms apply. 

1. Association for the Advancement of Medical Instrumentation (AAMI) - refer to I A.O. No. 2012—0001. 

2. Bureau of Health Facilities and Services (BHFS) — the regulatory agency of DOH charged with the implementation of the guidelines under this Order. 

3. Center for Health Development (CHD) -— the regional health ofﬁce of DOH. 

4. Contaminated — the state of having actual or potential contact with microorganisms. It generally refers to the presence of microorganisms that could produce disease or infection. Refer to Annex B of AD. No. 2012-0012 known as “Rules and Regulations Governing the New Classiﬁcation of hospitals and Other Health Facilities in the Philippines”. 

5. Decontamination — the use of physical or chemical means to remove, inactivateor destroy blood borne pathogens on a surface of item to the point where they are no longer capable of transmitting infectious particles and the surface or item is rendered safe for handling, use, or disposal. Refer to Annex B of AD. No. 2012-0012. 

6. Cleaning -- the removal, usually with detergent and water or enzyme cleaner and water, of adherent visible soil, blood, protein substances, microorganisms and other debris from the surfaces, crevices, serrations, joints, and lumens of instruments, devices, and equipment by a manual or physical process that prepares the items for safe handling and/or further decontamination. Refer to Annex B of AD. No. 2012-0012.

7. Disinfectant - usually a chemical agent (but sometimes a physical agent) that destroys disease-causing pathogens or other harmful microorganisms. It might not kill bacterial spores. It refers to substances applied to inanimate objects. Refer to Annex B of AD. No. 2012-0012. 

8. Disinfection —— the thermal or chemical destruction of pathogenic and other types of microorganisms. Disinfection is less lethal than sterilization because it does not destroyall microbial forms (e.g.bacterial spores). Refer to Annex B of AD. No. 2012-0012. ' 

9. Hemodialysis Clinic (HDC) —— refer to A0. No. 2012-0001. 

10. Heterotrophic Plate Count (HPC) «— approximate enumeratiOn of the total number of microorganisms that include pathogens, non—pathogens and opportunistic microorganisms that yield useful information about water quality, efﬁciency of the treatment process and microbial regrowth. 

11. Total Coliform - aerobic and facultative anaerobic, gram-negative, non-sporeforming bacilli. This includes bacteria found in soil, in water and in human or” animal waste. They are not useful as an indicator of fecal pathogens, but they can be used to assess the adequacy of the treatment process and the potential presence of bioﬁlms. 

12. Fecal (Coliform — a subset or group of the total coliforms that are considered to be present specifically in the gut and feces of warm-blooded animals. Escherichia col-i (E. coli) is the major species in the fecal coliform group that is the best indicator of fecal pollution and the possible presence of pathogens.

13. License to Operate (LTO) — refer to AD. No. 2012-0001. 

14. Reverse Osmosis (R0) — refer to AD. No. 2012—0001. 

15. Total Dissolved Solids (TDS) — inorganic salts and small amounts of organic matter present in solution in water. It (TDS) provides information on the chemical quality of the water. The principal constitIients are usually calcium, magnesium, sodium, and potassium cations and carbonate, hydrogen Carbonate, chloride,sulfate, and nitrate anions.

Water treatment systems and dialysis machines need to be decontaminated and disinfected periodically and whenever necessary. When test results exceed AAMI water standard limits, the concerned HDC shall temporarily cease its operations until the repeat test of the failing parameter(s) complies with the standards. 

The concerned HDC shall perform the following necessary 

corrective actions and notify their patients of the situation.

1. Cleaning and disinfection] replacement of R0 machine membranes; 

2. Disinfection of the product water distribution system, including the entire loop; 

3. Disinfection of the water hose on the dialysis machine. 0. Conduct a re—sampling and re-test of the affected parameter. 
 

VI. SCHEDULE OF FEES 

All laboratory fees charged for analyses of water in HDC shall be reasonable and enough to cover for the services rendered and shall be in accordance with the approved schedule of fees by BHFS. 

VII. VIOLATIONS 

Stakeholders found violating any provision of these guidelines and its related issuances, and/or commission/omission of acts by personnel operating the health facility under this Order shall be penalized and/or its LTO suspended or revoked. 

A failed test is a failure of the water treatment system and may not neCessarily constitute a violation. However, failure of HDC to immediately revert the failing parameter is a violation.
