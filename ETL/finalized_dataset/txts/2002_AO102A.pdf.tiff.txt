<subject>SUBJECT: Supplemental Guidelines on the Usage of 10,000 I.U. Vitamin A for Pregnant Women under the Vitamin A Supplementation Program</subject>


<body>

The beneﬁcial effect of Vitamin A supplementation to pregnant women should be continuously emphasized considering that 2 out of 10 pregnant women have low to deﬁcient levels of serum retinol levels. This is based on the National Nutrition Survey conducted in 1998 by the Food and Nutrition Research Institute which showed a Vitamin A Deﬁciency (VAD) prevalence among pregnant women of 22.2 % compared to 16.4% obtained in 1993.

Cognizant of this, Administrative Order No. 3-A s. 2000 on Vitamin A and Iron supplementation was issued on January 10, 2000. As stipulated in the said Order, pregnant women are priority targets for Vitamin A supplementation given the following schedule:

A. Preventive Supplementation for pregnant women without signs and symptoms of Vitamin A deﬁciency:

Preparation of Vitamin A to be used : 10,000 LU.
Dose : 1 tablet of soft gel capsule twice a week or a total of 20,000 LU. per week
When to start : 4th month or 16 weeks of gestation or pregnancy
Duration of supplementation : Until delivery

B. Therapeutic Supplementation for pregnant women with signs and symptomsof Vitamin A deﬁciency like night blindness

Preparation of Vitamin A to be used : 10,000 I.U.
Dose : 1 tablet daily for 4 weeks upon diagnosis regardless of age of gestation

Prenatal vitamins are normally prescribed to pregnant women during consultations with private physicians and even with RHU physicians. These multivitamin preparations taken daily contain 5,000 to 10,000 LU. of Vitamin A. In cases when pregnant women are already taking the prenatal vitamins or the multiple micronutrient tablets of UNICEF need not be given the 10,000 I.U. of Vitamin A. The multivitamin preparation will also be sufﬁcient to treat and prevent night blindness associated with Vitamin A deﬁciency. Onthe other hand, ferrous sulfate/folio acid can be given together with Vitamin A.

This Order reiterates the routine use of Vitamin A as preventive supplementation particularly for pregnant women. All other provisions of A.O. No. 3-A, s. 2000 that are not affected by this supplemental guideline shall remain in full force and effect.

This order shall take effect immediately.
