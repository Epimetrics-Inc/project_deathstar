<subject>SUBJECT: implementing Guidelines for Fourmula One for Health as Framework for Health Reforms</subject>

<body>
I. Background and Rationale

The current implementation of health reforms builds upon the lessons and experiences from the major health reform initiatives undertaken in the last 30 years - from the Primary Health Care approach in the late 1970s, the Generics Act in the late 1980s, the devolution of public health system in the early 1990s, the National Health insurance Act of 1995, to the Health Sector Reform Agenda (HSRA) conceptualized in the late 1990s.

Since the inception of the HSRA in 1999, health reforms have made inroads in at least 30 provinces. In health governance, municipalities have joined together to form Inter-Local Health Zones (ILHZs) to optimize sharing of resources and maximize joint benefits from local health initiatives. in health regulation, local government units have pooled their procurements to lower the price of essential drugs. in health service delivery, key LGU facilities have been upgraded to meet accreditation requirements and be entitled for capitation or reimbursements from PhilHealth. In health financing, LGUs have increased contributions needed to enroll indigents into the social health insurance program. Not only is the coverage of health services being improved in these localities, invaluable lessons are also being learned to bolster confidence in the implementation of these reforms nationwide.

While these developments in the health sector have given rise to opportunities, especially in the last five years, there are also existing constraints that must be taken into account in the crafting of relevant strategic action plans.

For years now, the DOH budget has been very restricted, with around 60 percent automatically spent for personal services alone, leaving very little to provide for operational and capital needs. Moreover, the share of health in the national budget, as well as the real value of its actual allocation, has declined. On the other hand, as LGUs receive larger allocation from the internal revenue allotment, their investment for health has also increased progressively after the devolution of health services. However, most LGUs spend at least 70 percent of these resources for salaries and benefits of local health personnel, also leaving very little for operational expenses and capital investment.

Furthermore, the allocation of public subsidies for health, across its major expense categories (is. personal services, maintenance and other operating expenses and capital outlay), has remained inflexible. Also, the national government cash position has been very limited, causing delays in the release of health budgets. In addition, the way existing budgets are allocated across the various health agencies and programs has no clear bearing on performance.

Thus, while health budgets have declined in terms of its real value, the DOH continues to face the difficult mandate of steering the highly decentralized and fragmented local public health systems and private health care markets. Therefore, effectively carrying out this mandate would require new capacities especially those needed to develop novel and creative means of implementing programs, in partnership with local government units (LGUs), the private sector and external development agencies.

The highly decentralized system also implies that the DOH needs to manage the total national health financing requirements from a multitude of sources that includes central and local health budgets, as well as social health insurance funds and external assistance. Relevant experiences on this undertaking have led to a deeper understanding of how social health insurance could leverage for better performance from the health system.

In the backdrop of these opportunities and constraints, the significant lessons learned from experiences in the last five years, with respect to health reforms in several localities, the growing interest and support from external development partners, the deeper understanding of the requirements of implementing reforms, the reinforcement from partner government agencies, and the revitalized political support for reforms from national leadership, however suggest that the timing for full implementation of health reforms is now.

In this light, FOURmula ONE for Health is hereby adopted as the implementation framework for health sector reforms. it is designed to implement critical health interventions as a single package, backed by effective management infrastructure and financing arrangements.

This order provides the strategic goals, objectives and operational guidelines for implementing FOURmula ONE for Health at the national and local levels.

II. Scope and Coverage

This issuance shall apply to the entire health sector, to include the public and private sectors, national agencies and local government units, external development agencies, and civil society involved in the implementation of health reforms.

III. Over-all Goals and Objectives

1. Secure more, better and sustained financing for health;
2. Assure the quality and affordability of health goods and services;
3. Ensure access to and availability of essential and basic health packages; and
4. improve performance of the health system

IV. General Guidelines:

A. FOURmula ONE for Health shall organize the critical reform initiatives into four implementation components, namely, Financing, Regulation, Service Delivery and Governance.

B. The implementation of FOURmuIa ONE for Health shall focus on a few manageable and critical interventions. Such interventions shall be identified using the following criteria:

1. Doable given available resources - Critical interventions identified for each component must be deemed doable given the available time, human and financial resources.

2. Sufficient groundwork and buy-in - The chosen interventions must be backed by sufficient groundwork and buy-in from implementation partners, especially in the development of reform packages for local implementation.

3. Triggers a reform chain reaction - These critical interventions must be able to trigger a chain of reaction that will spur the implementation of other FOURmuia ONE for Health interventions, within and across the four components.

4. Produces tangible results and generates public support - These critical interventions must be able to show tangible results within the immediate and medium terms, which in turn generate support and cooperation from the public.

C. The reforms shall be implemented under a sector-wide approach, which encompasses a management perspective that covers the entire health sector and an investment portfolio that encompasses all sources.

D. The National Health Insurance Program (NHIP) shall serve as the main lever to effect desired changes and outcomes in each of the four implementation components, where the main functions of the NHlP including enrollment, accreditation, benefit delivery, provider payment and investment are employed to leverage the attainment-of the targets for each of the reform components.

E. The functional and financial management arrangements shall be defined in terms of specific offices having clear mandates, performance targets and support systems, within well-defined time frames in the implementation of reforms within each component.

2. Presence of local initiatives or start-up activities relevant to FOURmula ONE strategies, to include, but not limited to: development of inter-local health zones, enrollment of indigents. into the social health insurance system, improvement in drug management systems, among others;

3. Relatively high feasibility of success and sustainability, to include factors such as capacity to enter into loans, capacity to absorb investments and sustain the reform process, etc.; and

4. Availability of funds from GOP and external sources for capital investment requirements.

V. FOURmula ONE for Health Component-Specific Objectives and Strategies

A. HEALTH FINANCING

1. Objective: The objective of financing reforms under FOURmula ONE for Health is to secure more, better and sustained investments in health to provide equity and improve health outcomes, especially for the poor.

2. Strategies:

a. Mobilizing resources from extra budgetary sources -

i. Additional resources for health shall be mobilized by increasing revenue generation capacities of health agencies without compromising access by the poor. This shall include revenues from user fees for personal health care and regulatory services, and rationalized use of real property assets belonging to government health agencies.

ii. Health agencies and facilities with significant revenue generating capacities shall not only support its own requirements but also contribute to meet the needs of non-revenue generating priority programs. However, such mechanisms shall be designed and introduced in a way that do not penalize or restrain fiscal performance among revenue generating agencies.

b. Coordinating local and national health spending -

i. The overall management of total health investments shall be undertaken using a sector wide approach, where health resources shall be pooled and allocated rationally across all levels, based on identified priority areas.

ii. The implementation of FOURmula ONE for Health shall be financed jointly by central and local governments, the PhilHealth, and external development agencies.

iii. Mechanisms to mobilize private sector resources shall likewise be developed and implemented.

c. Focusing direct subsidies to priority programs -

i. Efforts to mobilize more investments for health shall be coupled with measures to improve efficiency in the system on two accounts:

• maximizing the expected performance outputs using the available resources, and
• properly distributing or allocating the resources where they shall yield the optimum health impact.

ii. Existing resources for health shall be focused on identified priority areas and priority programs. Specifically, direct subsidies from national and local governments shall be focused on basic and essential health goods and services commonly used by the poor.

d. Adopting a performance based financing system -

i. Financing of health agencies and programs shall be shifted from historical or incremental budgeting system into one that is performance based. The budget allocations and releases shall therefore be conditioned on the achievement of performance targets.

ii. A multi-year budget scheme shall be developed to support selected priority programs that require long term financing.

e. Expanding the national health insurance program

i. The NHIP shall be further strengthened by expanding enrollment coverage, improving benefits and leveraging payments on quality of care.

ii. PhilHealth, recognizing that it operates in local markets, shall strengthen coordination and continue engaging partners at that level.

B. HEALTH REGULATION

1. Objective: The main objective of health regulation under FOURmula ONE for Health is assuring access to quality and affordable health products, devices, facilities and services, especially those commonly used by the poor.

2. Strategies:

a. On the supply side, systems and processes for licensing, accreditation and certification shall be harmonized and streamlined to make health regulation more rational and client-responsive, through the following strategies:

i. Establishing a "One-stop Shop" for the licensing of health facilities;
ii. Automating regulatory systems and processes;
iii. Integrating accreditation and certification into a unified "seal of approval";
iv. Introducing intensive, less frequent and incentive-based regulatory procedures,
v. Decentralizing appropriate regulatory functions to regional offices and LGUs; and
vi. Strengthening enforcement mechanisms and regulatory oversight functions of the DOH.

b. On the demand side, a "seal of approval system" on health products, devices, services or facilities shall be developed.

i. Such seal shall indicate that a certain level of standard or competency has been achieved, assuring providers and clients that fair and ethical standards are met. The presence or absence of such seals shall enable consumers to make informed decisions and demand quality products and services.

ii. The use of these seals shall be expanded and operationalized to include public and private health facilities, laboratories, pharmacies, and devices. These seals shall be linked to incentives to meet progressively higher standards for safety, effectiveness and quality.

c. Consistent with the over-all financing strategy of FOURmula ONE for Health, cost recovery with income retention for health regulatory agencies and other revenue-generating mechanisms shall be pursued to ensure financial sustainability. However, the use of retained revenues shall be backed by a rational and approved expenditure plan.

d. The availability of low-priced quality essential medicines commonly used by the poor shall be assured through the following mechanisms:

i. Promoting high quality generic pharmaceutical. products;
ii. Expanding pharmaceutical distribution networks (national and local hospital pharmacies, NGO-owned pharmacies, Botika ng
Barangay, Botika ng Bayan);
iii. Identifying alternative local and foreign sources of low-priced branded drugs; and
iv. Developing mechanisms for pooled procurement among health facilities and across LGUs to realize economies of scale.

C. HEALTH SERVICE DELIVERY

1. Objective: FOURmula ONE for Health interventions in service delivery are aimed at improving the accessibility and availability of basic and essential health care for all, particularly the poor. This shall cover all public and private facilities and services.

2. Strategies:

a. Basic and essential health service packages shall be made available in all localities while specific and specialized health services shall be made available by designated providers in strategic locations.

b. The quality of both basic and specialized health services shall be assured through the following mechanisms:

i. Health facilities shall be upgraded and human resource capability of these facilities shall be strengthened to comply with licensing and accreditation requirements.

ii. These facilities shall follow accepted standards of care such as clinical practice guidelines (CPG) or diagnostic-related groups (DRGs).

iii. The provision of specialized diagnostic procedures and services as well as specialty services involving the management of complicated diseases and conditions shall be assigned to preferred providers as incentive for delivering quality and affordable services.

c. Current efforts to reduce public health threats shall be intensified by taking on the following strategies:

i. Undertaking disease-free zones initiative -

• Areas where diseases such as malaria, filariasis, schistosomiasis, rabies, leprosy and vaccine-preventable diseases are major health problems shall be identified and targeted for intensive campaigns to eliminate these diseases as public health threats.

ii. Implementing intensified disease prevention and control strategies -

• Intensified disease prevention and control strategies for other priority diseases such as tuberculosis, HIV-AIDS and other communicable diseases shall be undertaken in intensified disease control zones where the greatest impact from health investments could be derived.

iii. Enhancing health promotion and disease surveillance -

• To reinforce the disease-free zones initiative and the intensified disease prevention and control strategies, enhanced health promotion and disease surveillance activities shall be undertaken.

• Disease surveillance shall be intensified to ensure that the targets for disease elimination, prevention and control are attained.

• Health promotion interventions shall be directed at the prevention and control of health hazards and health risk-taking behaviors, particularly those associated with lifestyle related diseases such as cardiovascular diseases, cancer, diabetes mellitus and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, among others.

D. GOOD GOVEBNANCE IN HEALTH

1. Objective: The objective of good governance in health is to improve health systems performance at the national and local levels. FOURmula ONE for Health shall introduce interventions to improve governance in local health systems, improve coordination across local health systems, enhance effective private-public partnership, and improve national capacities to manage the health sector.

• Assistance and support shall be provided to targeted provinces in the areas of financing, regulation, service delivery and governance to improve local health systems performance.

• The DOH shall immediately enter into partnership with at least 15 provinces then roll out the reform package to another set of at least 15 provinces in the next two years, and eventually cover the rest of the country.

• In order to ensure that FOURmula ONE for Health assistance in FOUR-IN-ONE Convergence Sites build upon local initiatives and are able to address local conditions and needs, the engagement shall be based on a dialogue among partners (is. LGUs, DOH, PhilHealth and other stakeholders), iterative in nature, and menu driven.

ii. A FOURmula ONE for Health LGU Scorecard shall be developed and employed to track the progress and compare the performance of various localities or inter-local health zones.

iii. A FOURmula ONE for Health Professional Development and Career Track shall be institutionalized where competent and dedicated health personnel shall provide quality health services and sound advice to local chief executives with regard to health reforms. To achieve this end, FOURmula ONE for Health shall pursue:

• Improving distribution and retention of critical health personnel, especially in under-served areas.
• Provision of human resource for health to underserved areas by the DOH. These personnel shall be trained to perform necessary functions as health providers, managers and advocates for the FOURmula ONE for Health.
• Developing managerial skills of local health supervisors and improving the technical competencies of field personnel.
• Expanding the professional career paths of qualified local health personnel by making them "first draft picks" for central office and Center for Health Development (CHD) placements. Career professionals from devolved health systems shall be prioritized in the hiring of central office and CHD personnel as an incentive for local health personnel to remain in the service and as a mechanism to ensure that the DOH will have a regular pool of experienced health managers.

b. National capacities to manage and steward the health sector shall be improved through the following strategies:

i. Technical leadership and management capability at central and regional levels shall be strengthened through retooling. and retraining of central office and CHD personnel as well as tapping DOH Representatives to serve as vital links to LGUs.

ii. Public finance and procurement management systems shall be improved through:

• Strengthening the financial management capacity at both central and CHD levels by developing a comprehensive and integrated financial management information system, such as the eNGAS, MTEF, etc.

• Strengthening the procurement, logistics and warehousing capacity in DOH

iii. Information and communication technology capability shall be strengthened to improve connectivity of the health sector and ensure access to quality health information.

iv. Monitoring and evaluation, research and knowledge management systems shall be strengthened to support a more rational performance assessment system and an evidence-based health policy development and decision-making process.

c. The development of rationalized and more efficient national and local health systems shall be pursued through strengthening networking mechanisms and referral systems, sharing of resources, organizational.transformation and restructuring, and capacity building, among others.

C. Given the diversity of funding sources and priorities, FOURmula ONE for Health shall offer a rational menu of interventions to finance, organized in a way that individual donors can support, while reflecting their own priorities and preferences.

1. This menu shall be viewed as a venue where various donors, the DOH, the LGUs and other agencies can dialogue and jointly answer how the full package of FOURmula ONE for Health implementation can be supported. The end goal of this dialogue shall be an optimal foreign assistance portfolio that:

a. Ensures that the full package of FOURmula ONE for Health implementation is fully supported;
b. Ensures that there is a balance between loans and grants, between funds for project preparation and funds for implementation in supporting targeted FOUR-in-ONE convergence sites;
c. Ensures that funds are applied in a timely manner, i.e. present and future support for FOURmula ONE for Health implementation are made available over a longer planning horizon; and
d. Ensures that funds are applied in a manner compatible with improving the capacities to manage the reforms, thus avoiding parallel funding agency operated agendas and management infrastructures.

2. Any health project that will be developed in the future shall as much as possible be Consistent with and brought into the FOURmula ONE for Health framework.

VIII. Timetable of Implementation

A. The FOURmula ONE for Health timetable shall be divided into two major phases: the Immediate term and the Medium term.

B. The immediate phase shall cover the period between August to December 2005. These five months correspond to the project preparation phase of the HSRA projects funded by various funding agencies in support of reforms in the DOH, PhilHealth and the existing 16 convergence sites. The medium term will cover years 2006-2010.

1. Immediate phase:

a. In August 2005, it is expected that the FOURmula ONE for Health framework shall facilitate the investment planning processes that are simultaneously being undertaken at the national and local levels. Furthermore, the DOH shall also start the scaling up of its intensified disease control programs, such as for tuberculosis and poliomyelitis, among others.

b. In September 2005, the quality seal systems for drugs, facilities and services shall be launched. The quality seal awards shall be conferred to qualified products, facilities and providers in the following year.

c. By October 2005, the initial drafts of the national and local investment plans shall have been submitted for validation and consolidation, in preparation for the cabinet level Investment Coordinating Council deliberations scheduled in November 2005. During this time also, relevant covenants between DOH, PhilHealth, the 16 LGUs and other partners shall have been approved, ratified and issued.

d. At the end of 2005, it is expected that DOH shall have completed the development of an overall investment plan for FOURmula ONE for Health implementation in the next five years.
