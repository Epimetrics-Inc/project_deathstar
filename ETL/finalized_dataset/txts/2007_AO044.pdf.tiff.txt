<subject>SUBJECT: Amendment to Section VIII. 3 of Administrative Order No. 18-A s. 1993 dated January 23, 1993 entitled “Standards of Quality Requirements for the Processing, Packaging, and Labelling of Bottled Drinking Water</subject>

I. RATIONALE

Section VIII. 3 of Administrative Order No. 18-A 5. I993 calls for the use of packaging materials of bottled drinking water, to wit:

”Bottles and caps shall be manufactured from virgin materials (i.e. materials which have not been recycled)."

Such requirement has become an impediment for the entry of safe packaging materials produced using acceptable re-cycling processes. With the emergence and existence of such acceptable re—cycling technologies amendment to the above requirement becomes imperative.
