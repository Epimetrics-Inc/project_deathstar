<body>


I. RATIONALE 

The Department of Health (DOH) is mandated to be the over-all technical authority on health that provides national policy direction and develop national plans, technical standards and guidelines on health. It is also a regulator of all health services and products, and provider of special or tertiary health care services and of technical assistance to other health providers especially to local government units. The implementation of Kalusugan Pangkalahatan or Universal Health Care is directed towards ensuring the achievement of the health system goals of better health outcomes, sustained health financing and responsive health system. 

One 'of the key components to achieve a responsive health system in the country is the widespread adoption of health data standards. This will allow data to be exchanged among different information systems or software applications with consistent definition or meaning. At present, there is lack of health data standards for adoption across the healthcare service delivery chain in the country. Healthcare providers or professionals are not able to share their patients’ health or medical records for continuing care. This is also true even if patients grant permission to access their medical records. There are different information systems or software applications being used by health facilities like hospitals. Most of these are aimed to manage patients’ medical records and respond to the reporting requirements of the DOH. This poses a problem when information needs to be exchanged between health facilities and when the DOH needs to analyze information coming from different health facilities. To be able to share and use data from different sources like healthcare providers, data must be built upon common definition, terminologies, elements, structures, and organization. The concept is called as interoperability and as such requires the use of health data standards. 

The World Health Organization defined eHealth as the use of information and communication technologies (ICT) for health. In health systems, ICTs are being used to improve the timeliness and reliability of public health reporting and facilitate the monitoring and surveillance of diseases. The DOH has used ICT in the development of health systems and registries (e.g. Electronic Field Health Services Information System, Online National Electronic Injury Surveillance Information System, Unified Chronic Non-communicable Disease Registry, among others), Integrated Hospital Operations and Management Information System for hospitals, Clinic Information System for health centers or clinics, telehealth, and others. There are many existing eHealth applications or solutions that are currently being used by health facilities like hospitals, and continuing eHealth initiatives at the national, regional and local levels. Hospitals and clinics have built their own information systems for their own purposes like processing of data and managing patients’ records, using different technology platforms (e.g. software programming, databases and operating systems), data formats, codes, and structures. 

The Department of Health and Department of Science and Technology have been at the forefront of eHealth and interoperability efforts. Works have already started in developing the country’s eHealth Framework and Plan, developing and promoting interoperability standards for the health sector at the level of aggregate records and individuals. The 66th World Health Assembly held in Geneva, Switzerland last May 2013 has urged member states to consider important actions to be taken on eHealth standardization and interoperability. The Philippines is one of the member states and has pledged to meet commitments contained in the resolution on the actions to be taken. Item #2 of the resolution considers to develop as appropriate, policies and legislative mechanisms linked to an overall national eHealth strategy, in order to ensure compliance in the adoption of ehealth and health data standards by the public and private sectors, as appropriate, and the donor community, as well as to ensure the privacy of personal clinical data. 

Thus, this Order on the National Implementation of Health Data Standards for eHealth Standardization and Interoperability (eHSI Release 001) sets the initial mandatory health data standards that shall be adopted or implemented by the entire health sector. New sets or updates to mandatory health data standards shall be thoroughly reviewed together with concerned stakeholders in health, and policies updated for implementation. 

II. DECLARATION OF POLICIES 

1. Strengthening health systems and improving efficiency and effectiveness in health service delivery need both operational and summary data. The former supports routine activities at the health provider level, whereas the latter to manage national health resources, develop policies, assess performance, and determine major investments, technical support and programs to achieve national health goals. Thus, information need to be made available when needed. 

2. As one nation, all health facilities need to comply with the national implementation of health data standards for interoperability to gain a true picture of the Philippines Health System, e. g. health status of the Filipino people, health issues, concerns and/problems that can be addressed by the health sector, and others. 

3. The Health Enterprise Architecture has provided the holistic view of the country’s health processes/systems, information, information technology assets, and interoperability standards. It serves as guide in the development of health information systems to meet the country’s requirements and support improvements in the health systems; helps describe the state of the health information system in the country; as well as provide the road map for continuing growth. 

4. Information and communication technOlogies (ICTs) can provide the means to join different systems and facilitate sharing of data/information. Various health facilities have already adopted the use of ICTs in their operations. With the use of technologies and standards for interoperability, the national health data reporting system to the Department of Health allows data aggregation from various data sources or different health facilities’ information systems. Health facilities, according to their capacities, may implement their own systems as long as these comply with the national health data reporting standards. 

5. This Order shall complement the following issuances, resolutions or provisions: 

1. Philippine Digital Strategy 2011-2016, a national strategy with the purpose of harnessing the potential and power of information and communications technologies to support the attainment of the govemment’s agenda and objectives contained in the social contract with the Filipino people and the Philippines Development Plan 2011-2016, and respond to the global trends towards a digital economy and knowledgesocieties and ensure that the country’s economy and society is prepared to compete in this digital economy and take advantage of its opportunities. 

2. Eugov Masterplan 2014-2016 that provides the framework to strengthen and integrate existing information systems that are vital to the delivery of services and information. Integrated Government Philippines (iGov Phil) which aims to set-up a government— shared network that will facilitate deployment and. integration of mission-critical ICT projects especially those that deliver common government services. 

3.
