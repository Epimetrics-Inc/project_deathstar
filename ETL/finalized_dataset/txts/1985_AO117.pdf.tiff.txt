<subject>Personnels Reappointed under the Re-organized setup are exempted from the provisions of MOH Administrative Order No. 65 as amended by Adm. Order No. 79, both series of 1980. </subject>

<body>
      The reorganization of the Ministry of Health under E.O. 851 which provides for the integration of field health services and the conversion of the four vertical programs into staff offices has made necessary certain changes in the provisions of Administrative Order No. 65 and Administrative Order No. 79, both series of 1980.
	The said Ministry policy, which has recently been upheld by the Merit Systems Board of the Civil Service Commission, restricts the employment of members of a family who are related within the third degree of consanguinity in the same hospital or office regardless of whether or not there is exercise of supervision by one over the other which is specifically covered by the rules on nepotism.
	Accordingly, where an office, hospital, service or project has been abolished, transferred or merged with another due to the reorganization, such personnel who are reappointed in the latter office shall be exempted from the restrictions of MOH Administrative Order No. 65 as amended. The same exemption shall also apply to personnel from abolished offices reappointed in any of the headquarters offices including the medical centers and special hospitals.
	As thus amended, Administrative Order No. 65, s. 1980 stands in effect.
