	I. Meaning of Metrication

(b) conversion or change of product size to standard, national, metric sizes as prescribed by the Metric System Board (MSB. 

2. The Metric System Board is authorized to draw up metric conversions program for all economic, social and other sectors of society and promulgate the necessary rules and regulations
  

3. A few non—SI units are so widely used that they are part of our everyday lives have been retained for general use with the SI:

4. A further group of non-SI units have been accepted for use with SI for a limited time:

       1. nautical mile
       2. knot
       3. are
       4. hectare

       10. curie
       11. roentgen
       12. rad
       
5. Four non-SI units for use with the SI in specialized field have been retained:
		
		1. electrovolt
2. unified atomic mass unit
3. parsic
4. astronomic unit

6. For the time being, the use of millimeter of mercury for kilopascal for blood pressure measurement is retained.

9. The degree Celsius (˚C) is an interval of one Kelvin (K) and
the Celsius temperature 0 ˚C is defined as 275.15 K, 32˚F ,
corresponds to 0 ˚C. The conversion factor to convert ˚F to ˚C is 5/9 (after subtracting 32) e. g. ˚F - 32 x 5/9 = 21.1 ˚C

10. Common Conversion Table:
