I. RATIONALE

The 1987 Philippine Constitution mandates the right of every Filipino to health. The State, under Section II of Article XIII. shall adopt an "integrated and comprehensive approach to health development which shall endeavor to make essential goods, health and other social services acceptable to all the people at affordable cost".

The state policy enunciated in Article II, Section 15 of the 1987 Constitution, that "The State shall protect and promote the health of the people and instill health consciousness among them".

Republic Act (RA) No. 6675 known as the "Generics Act of 1988," prescribes that it is the policy of the State to "ensure the adequate supply of drugs with generic names at the lowest possible cost".

RA No. 7581 also known as the "Price Act" and its Implementing Rules andRegulations (IRR) explicitly identifies the Department of Health (DOH) as the lead implementing agency in identifying essential drugs "basic necessities" and monitoring their corresponding prices.

RA No. 8792 also known as the "Electronic Commerce Act" was formulated to facilitate exchanges and storage of information through the utilization of electronic, optical and similar medium, mode, instrumentality and technology, to recognize the authenticity and reliability of electronic documents related to such activities and to promote the universal use of electronic transaction in the government and general public.

Department Order No. 238—T s. 2000, and as amended by Department Order No. 285—H s. 2002, were created in order to provide a system and procedure for the data collection on prices of selected essential drugs which is now known as the Essential Drug Price Monitoring System.

The DOH-recognizes the need to sustain the operations of the EDPMS and at the same time adaptively upgrade its specification to suit current and emerging trends in the market.

Also, the DOH recognizes the need for the greater involvement and coordination between and among the various units under it, so as to synergize their collective efforts in fulfilling the given mandates as reflected in the foregoing.
