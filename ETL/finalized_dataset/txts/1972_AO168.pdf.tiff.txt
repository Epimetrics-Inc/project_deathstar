<subject>SUBJECT : Provisions for additional service beds for Medicare cases under Program I in Hospitals under the Department of Health</subject>

<body>
With the implementation of Program I of the Philipine Medical Care Act of 1969 (R.A. 6111), hospital facilities and services of government hospitals under the Department of Health will have to be prepared for increases demands therefor from medicare beneficiaries, most of whom were heretofore entitled to free hospital accommodation anf services in charity wards, by reason of their low income under the provisions of Republic Act No. 747, as amended by Executive Order No. 578, Series of 1956. The adoption ofthe new scheme underwriting the cost of hospital and professional in-patient care under sair Republic Act No. 6111, makes it necessary to provide more beds available for medicare cases.

In view of this and notwithstanding the provisions of Section 6 of Republic Act No. 1939, otherwise known as the Hospital Financing Law, authority is hereby granted to all Chiefs of Hospitals under the Department of Health to utilize any available beds in their respective hospitals for the accommodation of medicare patients under Program I, should there be no more vacancy in the pay wards, but in no case shall these beds plus the 10% pay beds under R.A. 1939 exceed thorty per centum (30%) of the authorized bed capacity of the institution concerned.

All concerned are hereby enjoined to observe strictly this Order and be guided accordingly.

This Administrative Order shall take effect April 1, 1972.
