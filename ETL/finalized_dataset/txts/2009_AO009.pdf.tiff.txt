<subject>Subject : Application of Department of Health Policies, Plans and Guidelines Pertaining to Inﬂuenza A H1N1 Virus</subject>

<body>
Following WHO reports of human cases and deaths secondary to a virus originally found among swine population in Mexico, and similar occurrences in other countries, the WHO initiated the global alert and response to the inﬂuenza A H1N1 virus, recently identiﬁed as the causative agent of the imminent pandemic. 

The National Disaster Coordinating Council (NDCC), in compliance with Presidential Decree No. 1566 entitled, Strengthening the Philippine Disaster Control Capability and Establishing a National Program on Community Disaster, has mandated the Secretary of Health to Chair the NDCC response to the inﬂuenza A H1N1 threat. 

In order to execute effective, efﬁcient and coordinated actions by the health sector to prevent, contain and control the transmission of inﬂuenza A, the Department of Health, through the Emergency management Task Force for Inﬂuenza A H1N1 or Task Force Inﬂuenza, is issuing several guidelines and other ofﬁcial issuances as common reference to synchronize actions in response to inﬂuenza A H1N1. 

Because this is the ﬁrst time that inﬂuenza AHlNl is affecting human populations, its epidemiologic trend and clinical effects are largely unpredictable. Thus, the DOH will exercise its mandate to provide directions and courses of action as lead agency for health emergencies. The DOH, from time to time, will issue technical and operational guidelines that shall apply to and/or be enforced by national, sub-national and local government entities, non—government organizations, development partners and other agencies and organizations engaged in or affecting public health protection and health care provision. 

This administrative order serves to enforce department circulars, memoranda, advisories and other issuances related to the inﬂuenza A H1N1 emergency. Among other concerns, the DOH is issuing guidelines on guide for travelers, infection control and use of personal protective devices, screening and laboratory conﬁrmation procedures, clinical management of conﬁrmed cases, and on surveillance and contact tracing. 

This Order takes effect immediately.
