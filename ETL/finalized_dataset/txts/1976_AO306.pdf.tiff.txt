II. ORAL HEALTH STATUS
The specific dental diseases and conditions included in this record are dental caries, periodontal diseases, calculus, neoplasm and handicapping dento-facial anomalies.

1. Dental Caries-
Using the appropriate symbols in the legend, record the condition of each tooth present as diagnosed during the oral examination in the blank space for condition corresponding to each tooth which is represented by a circle and numbered in accordance with the two digit system. The circle is divided into five (5) parts representing the five tooth surfaces, namely: (1) occlusal, (2) mesial, (3) distal, (4) labio-buccal and (5) lingual surfaces. When a tooth is not present during the time of examination it is recorded either as missing due to caries, or missing due to other causes or unerupted tooth, using the appropriate symbols in the legend. When a tooth is found with clinical caries but not filled or restored, the exact location of the carious lesion is noted by outlining the tooth surface or surfaces involved. (See example). If the tooth is filled with permanent filling <missingtext> </missingtext> the dentist that the gold crown was placed after the tooth was filled, record the condition as filled teeth when there is no sign of secondary caries. If secondary caries is detected, record the condition either as decayed for filling or for extraction as the case may be. If the tooth shows signs of destruction of the epithelial attachment without any signs of clinical caries, record the condition as caries free. Write letter J at the middle of the circle representing the tooth with jacket crown and record the condition as filled or restored using the appropriate symbol. Write letters AB at the middle of the circle representing the tooth used as an abutment for fixed or removable bridge and record the condition as caries free when no clinical caries is detected. When clinical caries is detected record the condition either as decayed for filling or for extraction as the case may be.

Write letter P in the circle representing a pontic and record the condition of the tooth as missing due to caries or missing due to other causes as the case may be, using the appropriate symbols in the legend for condition. Encircle all the teeth and write the appropriate symbol for fixed bridge. Make a half circle showing the teeth with removable bridge and write the appropriate symbol.

11. Tooth Count - Count each tooth as a whole unit and not the number of carious surfaces filled or indicated for filling.
