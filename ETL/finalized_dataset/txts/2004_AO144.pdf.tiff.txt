<subject>SUBJECT: Guidelines for the Establishment and Operations of Botika ng Barangays (BnB) and Pharmaceutical Distribution Networks (PDNs)</subject>

<body>
I. RATIONALE

It is the policy of the State to protect and promote the right to health of the people. Particularly, the State, under Section II of Article XIII of the 1987 Philippine Constitution, is mandated to adopt an "integrated and comprehensive approach to health development which shall endeavor to make essential goods, health and other social services acceptable to all the people at affordable cost".

Meanwhile, Republic Act No. 6675, otherwise known as the Generic Act of 1988, prescribes that it is the policy of the State to "ensure the adequate supply of drugs with generic names at the lowest possible cost".

Further, the Local Government Code of 1991, particularly under Rule XIII of its Implementing Rules and Regulations, prescribes the kind of relationship between the Local Government Units (LGUs) and Peoples' Organizations (POs), Non-Government Organizations (NGOs) and Private Sector that may exist within the framework of devolution, and the latter's role as partners in the delivery of basic services.

Pursuant thereto, the Department of Health (DOH) crafted several issuances to implement and actualize the objectives of said State policies and aforementioned laws.

Accordingly, the DOH issued Administrative Order No. 23-A., dated 05 July 1996, that outlines the guidelines on the development and establishment of Botika ng Barangay (BnB) and Administrative Order No. 70, dated 03 January 2002, that provides for licensing procedures for Botika ng Barangays under the supervision of a registered pharmacist and with the support of the Local Government Units.

Recognizing further the vital role of the Private Sector and the Third Sector (Non-Government Organizations, People's Organization, Community Based Organizations, Cooperatives, and the likes), Administrative Order No. 159 dated 07 October 2002 was issued to provide policy guidelines and procedures for the utilization of financial assistance for the purchase of BnB drugs through the registration of Pharmaceutical Distribution Networks (PDNs).

The opening of opportunity to the people by way of the availability of Standby Funds from the Philippine Charity Sweepstakes Office (PCSO) and through partnership with the Philippine International Trading Corporation (PITC) as a procurement agent prompted the DOH to issue Administrative Order No. 64 dated 01 July 2003. The issuance caused the strengthening of the Centers for Health Development (CHDs) as vital instruments of the State and the DOH in establishing BnBs within their area of responsibility. The issuance further provided the specific mechanisms on how the funds will be utilized and how to sustain the operations of the BnBs.

The bullish promotion and advocacy of the BnBs by the CHDs and the DOH, created a ripple in the health sector, and several strategic partnerships were thereafter created between the DOH and several stakeholders. Among the partners recognized by the DOH are the Technology and Livelihood Resource Center, the Department of Labor and Employment, Botika Binhi (per Department Order No. 275-G s. 1994), and the National Pharmaceutical Foundation.

Thereafter, a review of the DOH's effort to expand and sustain the BnBs was conducted. The assessment disclosed that the several issuances that were used as basis for the establishment and operations of the BnBs needed to be revised and integrated into an omnibus Administrative Order to establish uniformity and sustainability in policies and procedures.

The existing guidelines promulgated under Administrative Order No. 70 s. 2002 for the issuance of a Botika ng Barangay Special License to Operate (BnB SLTO), in particular, were rationalized, re-examined and reviewed. Such reviews include analyses on the operational consequences of its provisions.

The review revealed that some of the requirements in the provisions of the subject issuance, i.e., unnecessary layers in the approval and reporting process, undefined specifications and standards, and undefined timelines in the decision-making process, may be considered as mere procedural barriers impeding immediate accessibility and delivery of drugs and medicines.

Therefore, in accordance with the provisions of Republic Act No. 3720, as amended, otherwise known as the Food, DrUgs, Devices and Cosmetics Act, and in order to establish, consolidate, and sustain the BnBs, as well as to streamline and simplify the BnB licensing system and to achieve the clarion call for the reduction of the cost of drugs and medicines, this omnibus Administrative Order is hereby issued.

II. OBJECTIVES

The objectives of this Order are as follows:

1. To promote equity in health by ensuring the availability and accessibility of affordable, safe and effective, quality essential drugs to all, with priority for marginalized, underserved, critical and hard to reach areas;

2. To integrate all related issuances of the DOH that provides rules and regulations in the establishment and operations of BnBs; and

3. To define the roles and responsibilities of the different units of the DOH and other partners from the different sectors in facilitating and regulating the establishment of BnBs.

III. DEFINITION OF TERMS

As used in this Administrative Order, the terms herein shall be understood to mean as follows:

1. Botika ng Barangay (BnB) - refers to a drug outlet managed by a legitimate community organization (CO)/non- government organization (NGO) and/or the Local Government Unit (LGU), with a trained operator and a supervising pharmacist specifically established in accordance with this Order.
