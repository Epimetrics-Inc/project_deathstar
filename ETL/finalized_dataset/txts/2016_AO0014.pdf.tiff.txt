<subject>SUBJECT: Implementing Guidelines on the Organization of Health Clubs for Patients with Hypertension and Diabetes in Health Facilities</subject>


<body>
I. RATIONALE 

Non-communicable Diseases (N CDs) continue to be the top causes of deaths among Filipinos. Of these, hypertension remains the leading illness. Diabetes continues to be signiﬁcantaaffecting around 5% of our adult population (Source: FNRI - National Nutrition Survey, 2013). 

To address the call for health interventions that are cost-effective and sustainable, the focus is on the most vulnerable risk group using two most common and easily detectable clinical manifestations of NCDs: hypertension and diabetes. By accelerating case detection of patients with risk factors, illnesses will most likely be found at an early stage, that is, before the onset of any damage to target organs. 

Campaigns are needed to detect as many patients as possible in the early stages of hypertension and diabetes. Organizing patients into active Health Clubs is one of the strategies to ensure continuity of care, raise the effectiveness of lifestyle changes and prevent complications. 

The following guidelines are hereby issued to strengthen the ﬁght against NCDs at the primary health facilities speciﬁcally, the health centers and barangay health stations. These guidelines reiterate the policies and thrusts outlined in the “National Policy on Strengthening the Prevention and Control of Chronic Lifestyle Related Non-Communicable Diseases (N CD)’.’ (DOH A0 2011- 003), and “Implementing Guidelines on the Institutionalization of Philippine Package of Essential NCD Interventions (PhilPEN) on the Integrated Management of Hypertension and Diabetes for Primary Health Care Facilities” (DOH A0 2012 — 0029). 

II. OBJECTIVES 

A. General objectives 

These guidelines aim to guide various stakeholders in health care in creating and sustaining Hypertension-Diabetes Health Clubs. 

B. Speciﬁc objectives 

1. Deﬁne the process of accelerating the identiﬁcation of patients based on the PhilPEN protocol, of creating a Patient Registry and of recruiting these patients into health clubs. 

2. Deﬁne the services and activities of the health club that will ensure at least 90% continuity of care to hypertensive and diabetic patients according to the PHIL PEN guidelines on lifestyle changes and the DOH guidelines on community activities especially patient education and motivation. 

3. Promote better access to maintenance medications and management of pharmaceutical supply chain. 

4. Deﬁne the roles and responsibilities of the different DOH ofﬁces and agencies, the LGUs and other stakeholders in organizing and sustaining health clubs. 

5. Create a mechanism for conduct of patient clubs that can be applicable for other diseases entities. 

III. SCOPE AND COVERAGE 

This issuance applies to all DOH units including its attached agencies, local government units (LGUs), non-government organizations, professional organizations, the private sector and other relevant partners in the health sector. 

Chronic Lifestyle Related NCDs affect the vulnerable age groups in all economic levels. Case ﬁnding and treatment shall no longer be limited to priority areas identiﬁed through the Conditional Cash Transfer (CCT) program or to families under the National Household Targeting System (NHTS) for Poverty Reduction. 

IV. DEFINITION OF TERMS 

A. PhilPEN Protocol - is the Philippine Package of Essential Non Communicable Disease Interventions for low-resource settings adopted from WHO PEN. This protocol consists of guidelines for the integrated management of hypertension and diabetes through a total risk approach. The individual client/patient is assessed and managed based on using the risk prediction chart. The prediction charts can estimate the client/patients risk of having a cardiovascular event (CV risk) in the next ten years. This will be applied to all patients screened for and found to have NCDs. 

B. Health Facilities — these are facilities that provide screening and management of diseases like hypertension and diabetes. May include but not limited to city health ofﬁces, rural health units (RHUS) and barangay health stations. 

C. DOH Hypertension and Diabetes Registry — a registry of patients diagnosed with hypertension and diabetes in the health facilities, linked to iClinicSys of RHUs and Integrated Chronic Non Communicable Disease Registry of hospitals. 

D. DOH Health Clubs — an organization that consist of ofﬁcers with rules andby-laws and a common goal of improving the health and wellness of its members. Initially, these shall be organized in health facilities such as RHUs and expanded to barangays. 

V. GENERAL GUIDELINES 

A. ACCELERATED CASE FINDING. Accelerated case finding is applicable for persons 40 years old and above. 

B. MANDATORY REGISTRY. All RHUs/health centers shall have a registry of all hypertensive and diabetic patients to closely monitor their health conditions and for provision of medications. 

C. VOLUNTARY ENROLLMENT. All diagnosed patients with hypertension and/or diabetes in all public and private health facilities shall be encouraged to enroll in designated Hypertension-Diabetes Health Clubs in their health center but will remain voluntary. The list of health clubs shall be submitted to DOH Central Ofﬁce after validation of the Provincial and Regional Ofﬁces. 

D. SERVICE DELIVERY NETWORK. Each health facility shall ensure that there is a network of higher facilities and providers within the province or city—wide health systems where referrals and other health care services can be provided. 

E. STANDARDIZIN G DIAGNOSTICS. Fasting Blood Sugar/Glucose (FBS) with 8 — 10 hours fasting shall be the standard of screening for diabetes instead of random blood sugar to promote efﬁciency in use of resources and facilitate follow—up. This shall be initially through the capillary method (glucometer) and conﬁrmed using the venous FBS. 

F. FOLLOW — UP OF PATIENTS. All patients with diagnosed hypertension and diabetes, regardless of membership into a Health Club, shall be scheduled for regular follow-up and re-evaluation by a physician based on PhilPEN. 

G. ADOPTION OF PhilPEN PROTOCOL. The PhilPEN protocol shall be the basis for further assessment, screening, management and follow—up of patients seen in the facilities. Risk assessment of persons between 25 and 39 years old apparently healthy, with risk factors or with early manifestation of disease shall continue as deﬁned in this protocol.
