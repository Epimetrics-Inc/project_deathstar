<subject>SUBJECT: Addendum to Administrative Order No. 5 s. 1998 — Implementing Guidelines for the Philippine Measles Elimination Campaign (PMEC)</subject>

<body>

The following guidelines are hereby issued to govern the “Mop Up Period” after the main Ligtas Tigdas Campaign which ended last November 30, 1998.

In order to ensure that the remaining target children who have not yet been vaccinated against measles during the Ligtas Tigdas Campaign period are vaccinated before March 31, 1999, the following guidelines are hereby issued:

1. The “Mop-up” period for the Philippine Measles Elimination Campaign (PMEC) started last December 1,1998 and will last until March 31, 1999. This is the period allotted for vaccination of children between 9 months to less than 15 years old who were missed during the Ligtas Tigdas Campaign held last September to November 1998.

2. Using the reported measles cases, identify areas where children may have been missed. Regional sentinel surveillance for November and December 1998 still show significant measles transmission especially among the children under 4 years old.
Since preschool children may be home bound, this group is that most likely missed in masterlisting and mass vaccination campaigns. Improve the measles surveillance system by bringing the reporting down to the level of the municipality and barangay. Include also private hospitals and clinics. A Measles Surveillance Manual is being prepared detailing the procedures and plans for surveillance. This manual will be given to you as soon as it is finalized. Conduct mop-up vaccination of all children missed during the Ligtas Tigdas period.

3. Using the reported measles vaccination coverage based on “estimated” eligible children in the area, review the completeness of masterlisting in those areas reporting less than 95% coverage. You should do a spot check in one or two barangays by counterchecking children randomly to see if they are in the list. Especially good to check are children in the streets (“street children”) in the cities and big towns. Areas found to have children not masterlisted should do a small campaign to capture the missed children. The defaulter’s lists should also be counterchecked and house—to—house mop-up or small community—based measles vaccinations can be conducted.

4. When staff are limited, start the search for missed children among preschoolers (9 months to less than 6 years old) since they are the ones most likely to still be unprotected from measles. Another group most likely to be missed are the out-of—school youths. 

5. Schools that have low initial coverage should be rescheduled for other vaccination rounds. Ensure good information campaign before the subsequent vaccination session.

6. During the mop-up period which will be until March 31, 1999, children who turn 9 months old should also be given their first measles vaccination. 

The Ligtas Tigdas Campaign now lists a 96% coverage of target children and this is an excellent performance from everyone, as usual. The mop—up period, however, is still necessary since the ultimate objective is 100% coverage. Measles will infect anyone who has not been immunized. Every child has the right to protection against diseases.

For compliance.
