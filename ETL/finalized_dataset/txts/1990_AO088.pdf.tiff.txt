It is reiterated that under Executive Order No. 119, the
appointments of regional directors, assistant regional
directors, provincial health officers, assistant provincial
health officers, district health officers or chiefs of district
hospitals are to organizational units not to specific regions,
provinces or districts .

1. Section 16 of E.O. 119 provides, among others, that: 'The appointment of the Regional Director and Assistant Regional Director shall be to the Department at large and assignment shall be by administrative issuance of the Secretary."

2. Section 17 of the same E.O., provides similarly that: " The
Provincial Health Officers and Assistant Provincial Health
Officers shall be appointed by the Secretary to a region,
and their assignment shall be made by the Secretary on
recommendation of the Regional Health Director "

3. Section 18 also provides that: "District Health Officers
(also known as Chiefs of district hospitals) shall be appointed by the Secretary to a region, and their assignment shall be made by the Secretary on recommendation of the Regional Health Director."

4. All officials covered by these provisions are reminded
that changes in assignment as long as within the
organizational unit to which the appointment was made do
not require new appointments to be issued. For instance,
regional directors and assistant regional directors are
appointed to the Department and may be assigned anywhere in the Department. Or, provincial health officers, assistant provincial health officers, and district health officers/chiefs of district hospitals may be assigned anywhere in the region to which they
were appointed. In this respect, changes in assignment
covered by the administrative issuance of the Secretary
are not to be regarded as transfers or detail except when
specifically provided in the order.
