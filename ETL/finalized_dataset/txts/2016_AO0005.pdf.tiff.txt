<subject>SUBJECT: National Policv on the Minimum Initial Service Package (MISP) for Sexual and Reproductive Health (SRH) in Health Emergencies and Disasters</subject>


<body>
I. BACKGROUND 

The Philippines ranks second to Vanuatu as the most disaster-prone country in the world based on the World Disaster Risk Index of the 2014 World Risk Report of the UN University Institute of Environment and Human Security. Yearly, it experiences almost all forms of natural and human-induced calamities such as typhoons, earthquakes, ﬂoods, volcanic eruptions, landslides, ﬁres, and armed conﬂicts. Statistics show that from 1900 to 2012, the Philippines was hit by 531 disasters, affecting more than 160 million people and causing USD 10.5 billion in economic damages. In 2013 alone, 16 disasters hit the country, the most deStructive of which was Typhoon Haiyan (Yolanda) affecting 26 million peeple with at least 8,000 casualties (NDRRMC Final Report on Typhoon Yolanda: 2013). These data show the impact of natural disasters resulting in extensive damage to houses and facilities, loss of lives, livelihood and breakdown of services (CRED Crunch Issue No, 34 jcmc 2014). 

In times of crisis, reproductive health concerns become even more signiﬁcant as causes of new risks. In any affected population, it is globally estimated that about 4% of the total population are pregnant, another 3.5% are lactating women and 15% are adolescents. Around 15% of pregnancies may end up in complications while 5 to 15% will require a Caesarian section. Premature delivery among pregnant women may occur during times of displacement. Furthermore, the disruption of vital access to reproductive health care, information, and services would deprive pregnant and lactating women, their newborns, young people and men of essential health care services or interventions such as prenatal care, skilled birth attendance, postpartum care, newborn care, adolescent sexual and reproductive health care, family planning and STI, HIV and AIDS services. There is, therefore, a clear need for emergency health care for pregnant and lactating women and their newborns and to protect women, girls and other vulnerable groups from gender—based violence (GBV), unplanned/unintended pregnancies, or STI, HIV and AIDS during emergencies and disasters. 

Chapter 10 of the 1994 ICPD Programme of Action states that “all migrants, refugees, asylum seekers and displaced persons should reCeive basic education and health services”. This emphasizes that all people, including those living in humanitarian settings, have the right to reproductive health. 

Due to the susceptibility of the country to disasters, the Philippine Congress passed Republic Act No. 10-121 also known as the Philippine Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Act of 2010. This law aims to strengthen the Philippine Disaster Risk Reduction and Management System. It mandates the creation of a National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Council (NDRRMC) and the institutionalization of the National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Plan (NDRRMP) consistent with the National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Framework (NDRRMF), which envisions ” a country of safer, adaptive and disaster — resilient Philippine communities towards sustainable development”. 

The NDRRMP covers four thematic areas, namely: Disaster Prevention and Mitigation, Disaster Preparedness, Disaster Response, and Disaster Rehabilitation and Recovery. Under disaster response, the National Disaster Response Plan (N DRP) adopts the global humanitarian cluster approach which designates cluster leads and ensures that there is predictable leadership and accountability in all the main sectors or areas of activity. Under the NDRP, there are currently eleven clusters: Food and Non—Food Items (FNI); Camp Coordination and Camp Management (CCCM); Health; Education; Protection; Search, Rescue and Retrieval (SRR); Management of the Dead and Missing (MDM); Logistics; Emergency Tele - Communications (ETC); Law and Order (LAO); and International Humanitarian Relations (IHR). Each of the cluster has a designated Government agency cluster lead and a UN agency or International Humanitarian Partner (IHP) co-lead. 

The Department of Health (DOH) leads the Health Quad Cluster which includes Health; Nutrition; Water, Sanitation and Hygiene (WASH); and Mental Health and Psychosocial Support Services (MHPS S). 

II. DECLARATION OF POLICIES 

The Minimum Initial Service Package (MISP) for Sexual and Reproductive Health (SRH) is provided for in the Magna Carta of Women (RA 9710) enacted in August 2009, and in the Responsible Parenthood and Reproductive Health Law (RA 10354) enacted in December 2012. The IR of the Magna Carta of Women under Rule IV — Rights and Empowerment, Section 13 provides that “there should be timely, adequate and culturally appropriate provision of comprehensive health services, including the implementation of the MISP for SRH at the early stage of the crises”. 

The IR of the RPRH Law under Chapter 2 — Provisions and Financing of Care, Rule 4 _. Service Delivery Standards, Section 4.15, on the other hand, provides for maternal and newborn health in crisis situations. In particular, “LGUs and the DOH shall ensure that a minimum initial service package for reproductive health, including maternal and neonatal health care kits as deﬁned by the DOH, shall be given proper attention in crisis situations such as disasters and humanitarian crises. The minimum initial service package shall become part of the DOH response to crises and emergencies. Temporary facilities such as evacuation centers and refugee camps shall be equipped to respond to the special needs of the following situations: normal and complicated deliveries, pregnancy complications, spread of HIV and STIs and gender—based violence.” 

III. OBJECTIVES 

A. To provide guidelines to all concerned agencies and stakeholders on the implementation of the Minimum Initial Service Package (MISP) for Sexual and Reproductive Health (SRH) during emergencies and disasters. 

B. To define the core package that will constitute the MISP for SRH during emergencies to be integrated in the DOH essential service package for emergencies. 

C. To create the national Reproductive Health Coordinating Team (RHCT) that will ‘ coordinate the implementation of the MISP for SRH during emergencies. 

IV. SCOPE AND COVERAGE 

These guidelines apply to all DOH Central and Regional Ofﬁces and its attached agencies, public and private health facilities, civil society organizations, private organizations and other international and local humanitarian partners that have mandates and interests in the delivery of SRH and GBV services in the preparedness, response, recovery and rehabilitation phases of an emergency. 

V. DEFINITION OF TERMS 

A. Cluster Approach -a way of organizing coordination and cooperation among humanitarian actors to facilitate joint assessments, analysis, strategic planning, response, monitoring and evaluation of humanitarian situations. It establishes a clear system of leadership and accountability for response in each sector; and provides a framework for effective partnerships among national, local and international humanitarian actors in each sector. 

B. Disaster — a serious disruption of the functioning of society, causing widespread human, material or environmental losses which exceed the ability of the affected society to cope using its own resources. 

C. Disaster Risk Reduction and Management —— the systematic process of using administrative directives, organizations and operational skills and capacities to implement strategies, policies and improved coping capacities in order to lessen the adverse impacts of hazards and the probability of disaster. 

D. Emergency — unforeseen or sudden occurrence, especially danger, demanding immediate action. 

E. Gender—Based Violence (GBV) - is a term for any harmﬁll act directed against a person on the basis of gender. It includes acts that inﬂict physical, mental or sexual harm or suffering, threats of such acts, coercion and other deprivations of liberty (Inter — Agency Standing Committee on GVB Guidelines 2015) 

F. Humanitarian Crisis — an event or series of events that represent a critical threat to the health, safety, security of wellbeing of a community or other large group of people usually over a wide area. Armcd conﬂicts, epidemics, famine, natural disasters and other major emergencies may all involve or lead to a humanitarian cn31s. 

G. Inter-Agency Emergency Reproductive Health Kits —- refer to twelve (12) standard kits primarily designed to facilitate provision of priority RH services to displaced populations without medical facilities or where medical facilities are disrupted during crisis. They contain essential drugs, supplies and equipment to be used for a limited period of time by a speciﬁc number of people. 

H. Minimum Initial Service Package (MISP) for Sexual and Reproductive Health (SRH) - a set of priority activities to be implemented in emergency situations with the goal of reducing maternal mortalities, morbidities and disabilities through speciﬁc interventions on coordination, prevention of gender-based violence, prevention of sexually transmitted infections-human immune deﬁciency virus/ acquired immune deﬁciency syndrome (STI, HIV and AIDS), maternal and neonatal care, and planning for comprehensive RH following the SPHERE standard. When implemented in the early days of an emergency, it can save lives and prevent illness, especially among women and girls. 

I. Project SPHERE — initiated in 1997 by a group of humanitarian non—governmental organizations and the International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement, the project identiﬁed a set of minimum standards in key life-saving sectors such as WASH, food security, nutrition, non-food items, health and shelter that must be achieved in any humanitarian response in order for disaster-affected populations to survive and recover in stable conditions with dignity. 

J. Provider of Last Resort -- where necessary and depending on access, security and availability of funding, the cluster lead, as provider of last resort, must be ready to ensure the provision of services required to ﬁll critical gaps identiﬁed by the cluster. The provision of last resort is activated when all three conditions below are met: 1) The cluster agrees that there is an important life-threatening gap in the response; 2) One or more of the agreed benchmarks for the response as a whole is not being met; and 3) Evidence suggests that a signiﬁcant proportion of the target population is at risk of avoidable death if the gap is not ﬁlled urgently. 

K. Reproductive Health (RH) — is the state of complete physical, mental, and social well-being, and not merely the absence of disease or inﬁrmity, in all matters relating to the reproductive system and to its functions and processes. Reproductive health, therefore, implies that people are able to have a safe and satisfying sex life and that they have the capacity to reproduce and the freedom to decide if, when and how often to do so. It also includes sexual health, the purpose of which is the enhancement of life and personal relations. 

L. Sexual Violence — any sexual act, attempt to obtain a sexual act, unwanted sexual comments or advances or acts to trafﬁc a person’s sexuality using coercion, threats of harm or physical force, by any person, regardless of relationship to the victim, in any setting, including but not limited to home and work. 

M. Trafficking in Persons — refers to the recruitment, transportation, transfer or harboring, or receipt of persons with or without the victim’s consent or knowledge, within or across national borders by means of threat or use of force, or other forms of coercion, abduction, fraud, deception, abuse of power or of position, taking advantage of the vulnerability of the person, or the giving or receiving of payments or beneﬁts to achieve the consent of a person having control over another person for the purpose of exploitation or the prostitution of others or other forms of sexual exploitation, forced labor or/services, slavery, servitude or the removal or sale of organs. 

N. Violence against Women — refers to any act of gender-based violence that results in, or is likely to result in, physical, sexual or psychological harm or suffering to women, including threats of such acts, coercion, or deprivation of liberty, whether occurring in public or in private life. It shall be understood to encompass, but not limited to, the following: 

1. Physical, sexual, psychological and economic violence occurring in the family, including battering, sexual abuse of female children in the household, dowry-related violence, marital rape, and other traditional practices harmful to women, non-spousal violence and violence related to exploitation; 

2. Physical, sexual, and psychological violence occurring within the general community, including rape, sexual abuse, sexual harassment, and intimidation at work, in educational institutions and elsewhere, trafﬁcking in women, and prostitution; and 

3. Physical, sexual and psychological violence perpetrated or condones by the State, wherever it occurs. It also includes acts of violence against women as deﬁned by Republic Acts No. 9208 and 9262. 

O. Vulnerability — can be deﬁned as the diminished capacity of an individual or group to anticipate, cope with, resist and recover from the impact of a natural or man-made hazard. Vulnerability is most often associated with poverty, social group, gender, ethnic or other identity, age and other risk factors. 

P. Women’s Kits — (also called “dignity kits”) refer to a package of supplies and materials for distribution to women of reproductive age affected by disaster situations (see Annex A for contents). 

Q. Women of Reproductive Age (WRA) — refer to women ages 15—49 years old. 

VI. GENERAL GUIDELINES 

A. The MISP for SRH shall be implemented in all humanitarian crises guided by the principles of humanity, neutrality and impartiality. 

B. The MISP for SRH shall be implemented at the onset of an emergency or disaster, without site speciﬁc needs assessment, utilizing national estimates on population data and health care, when available, and shall continue until comprehensive RH services are in place. 

C. All humanitarian partners providing SRH services during emergencies and disasters shall comply with the MISP for SRH as a SPHERE standard. 

D. The MISP for SRH shall include services on safe motherhood, family planning, STI, HIV and AIDS and gender-based violence in crisis situations. 

E.

F. MISP for SRH shall be integrated in the following pillars of the health system during emergencies and disasters: 

1. Leadership and Governance — This involves ensuring committed leadership of the DOH through HEMB, FHO and DPCB to implement the MISP for SRH nationwide combined with effective oversight, coalition-building, regulation, transparency and accountability. 

2. Service Delivery— MISP for SRH shall be part of the health emergency package of services to be delivered by LGUs. The DOH shall act as a provider of last resort, ready to provide SRH services to ﬁll identiﬁed critical gaps of LGU and NGO partners during the emergency. 

3. Capability Building - A module on the MISP for SRH will be included in the regular health emergency training. Localized versions of the MISP for service providers, local disaster risk reduction and management (LDRRM) teams and communities are also available. The HEMB, FHO and the DPCB will roll out the MISP trainings. 

4. Regulatory — MISP for SRH shall be implemented according to global (SPHERE) and national standards and guidelines (see Annex B for SPHERE standards).

PROJECT SPHERE GUIDELINES ON THE MISP 

Source: The SPHERE Project Humanitarian Charter and Minimum Standards in Humanitarian Response 2011 Edition 

2.3 Essential health services — sexual and reproductive health 

All individuals including those living in disaster-affected areas, have the right to reproductive health (RH). To exercise this right, affected populations must have access to comprehensive RH information and services to make free and informed choices. Quality RH services must be based on the needs of the affected population. They must respect the religious beliefs, ethical values and cultural backgrounds of the community, while conforming to universally recognized human rights standards. 

Essential health services «— sexual and reproductive health standard 1: Reproductive Health 

People have access to the priority reproductive health services of the Minimum Initial Service Package (MISP) at the onset of an emergency and comprehensive RH as the situation stabilizes. 

Key actions (to be read in conjunction with the guidance notes) 

- Identify a lead RH agency within the health sector or cluster to facilitate the coordination and implementation of the MISP and ensure that an RH ofﬁcer (nominated by lead RH agency) is in place and functioning within the health sector or cluster ( see guidance note 1). 
- Implement measures to reduce the risk of sexual violence, in coordination with other relevant sectors or clusters ( see guidance note 3). 
- Ensure services for clinical management of sexual violence, including access to mental health and psychosocial support and legal assistance (see guidance note 3 and Protection Principle 2, guidance note 7 on page 37). 
- Establish the minimum set of HIV prevention, treatment, care and support services to reduce the transmission of HIV (see Essential health services — sexual and reproductive health standard 2 on page 328) 
- Ensure that emergency obstetric and newborn care services are made available and accessible including: 
- at health centres —— skilled birth attendants and supplies for normal births and basic management of emergency obstetric and newborn complications; basic emergency obstetric care (BEmOC) and newborn care 
- at referral hospitals «- skilled medical staff and supplies for comprehensive management of obstetric and newborn complications; comprehensive emergency obstetric care (CEmOC) and newborn care 
- a communication and transportation system to manage obstetric and newborn emergencies is etsbalished and functioning 24 hours a day, seven days a week from the community to the health centre and between the health centre and referral hospital (see guidance note 4). 
- Provide clean delivery kits to visibly pregnant women and birth attendants for clean home deliveries when access to a skilled health providers and health facility is not possible ( see guidance note 4). 
- Inform populations about the beneﬁts and availability of clinical services for survivors of sexual violence and the emergency referral system for complications of pregnancy and childbirth (see guidance notes 34). 
- Ensure that common comtraceptive methods are available to meet demand (see guidance note 2). 
- Plan to implement comprehensive RH services, integrated into primary healthcare, as soon as possible (see guidance note 1). 

Key indicators (to be read in conjunction with the guidance notes) 
- All health facilities have trained staff, sufﬁcient supplies and equipment for clinical management of rape survivors services based on national or WHO protocols. 
- All pregnant women in their third trimester have received clean delivery kits. There are at least four health facilities with BEmOC and newborn care/5 00,000 population. 
- There are at least one health facility with CEmOC and newborn care/500,000 population. 
- The proportion of deliveries by Caesarian section is not less than 5 per cent or not more than 15 per cent (see guidance note 4). 

Guidance notes 

1. Minimum Initial Service Package: The MISP deﬁnes those services that are most important for preventing RH-related morbidity and mortality among women, men and adolescents in disaster settings. It comprises a coordinated set of priority RH services that must be implemented simultaneously to prevent and manage the consequences of sexual violence, reduce the transmission of HIV, prevent excess maternal and newborn morbidity and mortality, and begin planning for comprehensive RH services as soon as the situation stabilizes. Flaming for the integration of good-quality comprehensive RH activities into primary health care at the onset of the emergency is essential to ensuring a continuum of care. Comprehensive RH care involves upgrading existing services, adding missing services and enhancing service quality. ' 

2. RH supplies: Supplies for the MISP must be ordered, distributed and stored to avoid delay in getting these essential products to the population. The Inter— agency Emergency Health Kit includes a limited quantity of medicines for patient post-exposure prophylaxis, magnesium sulphate and instruments and medicines for midwifery care, but not all supplies required for the MISP. The Interagency Reproductive Health Kits, developed by the Interagency Working Group on RH in Crises contain medicines and supplies for a three-month period. 

3. Sexual violence: All actors in disaster response must be aware of the risk of sexual violence including sexual exploitation and abuse by humanitarians, and must work to prevent and respond to it. Aggregate information on reported incidents must be. safely and ethically compiled and shared to inform prevention and response efforts. Incidence of sexual violence should be monitored. Measures for assisting survivors must be in place in all primary level health facilities and include skilled staff to provide clinical management that encompasses contraception, post—exposure prophylaxis to prevent HIV, presumptive treatment of sexually transmitted infections (STIs), wound care, tetanus prevention and hepatitis B prevention. Women should be offered unbiased counseling so as to reach an informed decision. Survivors of sexual violence should be supported tpo seek and be referred for clinical care and have access to mental health and psychosocial support. At the survivor’s request, protection staff shoud provide protection and legal support. All examination and treatment should be done only with informed consent of the survivor. Conﬁdentiality is essential at all stages -( see Health Systems standard 5, guidance note 4 on page 307 and Protection Principlel, guidance notes 7—12 on page 35). 

4. Emergency obstetric and newborn care: Approximately 4 percent of the disaster—affected pepulation will be pregnant women. Approximately 15 per cent of all pregnant women will experience an unpredictable obstetric complication during pregnancy or at the time of delivery that will require emergency obstetric care and 5 — 15 per cent of all deliveries will require surgery, such as a caesarian section. In order to prevent maternal and newborn mortality and morbidity resulting from complications, skilled birth attendance at all births, BEmOC and neonatal resuscitation should be available a1 all primary health care facilities. BEmOC functions include parenteral antibiotics, parenteral uterotonic drugs (oxytocin), parenteral anticonvulsant drugs (magnesium sulfate), manual removal of retained products of conception using appropriate technology, manual removal of the placenta, assisted vaginal delivery (vacuum or forceps delivery) and maternal and newborn resuscitation. CEmOC ﬁmctions include all of the interventions in BEmOC as well as surgery under general anaesthesia (Caesarian delivery, laparotomy) and rational and safe blood transfusion. 

The referral system should ensure that women or newborns are referred and have the means to travel to and from a primary health care facility with BEmOC and newborn care and to a hospital with CEmOC and newborn care services. ' 

Essential health services — sexual and reproductive health standard 2: HIV and AIDS 

People have access to the minimum set of HIV prevention, treatment and care and support services during disasters. 

Key actions (to be read in conjunction with the guidance notes) 

- Establish standard precautions and safe procedures for waste disposal within all healthcare settings (see guidance note 2 and health systems standardl , guidance notes 10-1 1 on pages 299-300). 
-Establish and follow safe blood supply and rational use of blood transfusion (see guidance note 2 and Health Systems standard 1, guidance note 5 on page 298)
- Establish access to good quality free male and female condoms including information on proper condom use. 
- Ensure that health facilities provide syndromic management of all patients presenting with symptoms of a sexually transmitted infection. 
- Ensure that post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) services are provided to individuals within 72 hours of the incident of potential exposure to HIV (see guidance note 3). 
- Provide information in accessible formats and education on HIV prevention in both the general public and high-risk groups (e. g. sex workers). 
- Ensure prevention of mother-to—child transmission (PMTCT) of HIV by ensuring access to contraceptives, clean and safe child deliveries (including emergency obstetric care and provision of anti—retroviral (ARV) drugs (see guidance note 4). 
- Provide treatment,care and support for infants born from mothers known to be HIV positive, including guidance and counseling in infant feeding (see infant and young child feeding standard 2 on page 160). 
- Ensure that people living with HIV (PLHIV) receive healthcare, including co- trimoxazole prophylaxis for HIV-related infections. 
- Ensure that people who were previously on anti—retroviral therapy (ART) continue to receive treatment (see guidance note 4). 
- Establish links between HIV and tuberculosis programmes where they exist. 
- Ensure that people at higher risk of exposure to HIV have access to HIV prevention interventions for sexual transmission of HIV and access to clean injecting equipment for known injecting drug users where these services already exist. 
- Initiate plans to broaden the range of HIV control services in the post—disaster phase (see guidance note 1). 

Key indicators (to be read in conjunction with the guidance notes) 

- People at most risk of exposure to HIV are targeted with a HIV prevention programme. 
- Pregnant women known to be HIV—positive have received ARV drugs for PMTCT. 
- 100 per cent of transfused blood is screened for transﬁision—transmissible infections including HIV. 
- Individuals potentially exposed to HIV (occupational exposure in healthcare settings and non-occupational exposure) have received PEP within 72 hours of an incident 
- All primary healthcare facilities have antimicrobials to provide syndromic management to patients with symptoms of an STI. 

Guidance notes 

1. HIV control: The minimum set of HIV prevention, treatment, care and support described in the key actions for this standard is comprised of actions that the health sector must take to prevent HIV transmission and to provide care and support to PLHIV. They should be implemented during the early stages of any disaster response. 

2. Prevention of HIV transmission in healthcare settings: The prevention of transmission of HIV in healthcare settings (e.g. hospitals, healthcare clinics, vaccination campaigns) is a priority during the early stages of disaster response. Essential actions are ensuring the application of standard precautions, establishing safe and rational blood transfusion practices and the correct disposal of healthcare waste (see Health systems standard 1, guidance notes 5, 10-11 on pages 298-300). 

3. Post—exposure prophylaxis: PEP to prevent HIV infection includes counseling, HIV exposure risk assessment, informed consent, assessment of the source and provision of ARV medicines. However, PEP should not be provided to a person who is known to be HIV positive; counseling and testing should never be mandatory nor should the provision of PEP be delayed while waiting for the test results. 

4. Anti~retroviral drugs: The provision of ARV for PMTCT, PEP and long-term ART in disaster situations is feasible. Continuation of ART for those already on treatment prior to the disaster must be considered a priority during disaster response. Pregnant women already taking ART should continue taking ARV without interruption. Pregnant women known to be HIV—positive should receive ARV for PMTCT according to the national protocol wherever possible.
