<subject>SUBJECT: Revised Operational Guidelines for the Implementation of the Doctors to the Barrios (DTTB) Program</subject>

<body>
I. RATIONALE

Given the reality where there is a varying pace of development and inequitable distribution of scarce resources, 271 municipalities were identified in 1992 to be doctorless and lacking in the capability to provide adequate health services resulting in high mortality and morbidity rates in these areas.

The Doctors to the Barrios (DTTB) Program was created by the DOH in May 1993 to address this need. Its vision is that all municipalities in the Philippines shall have doctors. Its mission is to deploy competent, committed, community-oriented and dedicated doctors to the doctorless municipalities. Although the Doctors to the Barrios Program deploys doctors to municipalities, as the Municipal Health Officers of these municipalities, these doctors reach and serve all the barrios of the municipality, including the most inaccessible ones. Hence the program name: Doctors to the Barrios, remains appropriate.

The doctors of the DTTB program shall be the health leaders/managers in developing local health systems in a devolved set-up. To attract doctors to serve in these far-flung and difficult areas of the country, the DOH packaged professional and financial incentives for the physician under the Program.

Of the original 271 municipalities identified, 198 municipalities were served, many among these were served more than once due to exigency of service. Other municipalities have also been identified as doctorless in the succeeding years. Thus, the need to continue the DTTB Program.

The Doctors to the Barrios Program (DTTB), now on its 9th year of implementation, has decentralized its program management to the Centers for Health Development (CHD). In effect, the CHD shall be responsible for the implementation of the DTI‘B program, the recruitment, selection and deployment of DTTBs in their respective regions with the participation of a team from DOH-Central Office and other stakeholders, and the monitoring and supervision of the DTTBs.

II. OBJECTIVES:

1. To ensure quality health care service to depressed, marginalized and underserved areas through the deployment of competent and community-oriented doctors.

2. To effect changes in the approach to health care delivery by the stakeholders in health.

III. COVERAGE:

The following areas will be given priority:

1. Depressed, unserved/underserved, hard to reach and critical 5th and 6th class municipalities without doctors for at least two (2) years

2. Depressed, unserved/underserved, hard to reach and critical municipalities with RHPs/MHOs on study leave.

3. 3rd and 4th class municipalities needing additional doctors to achieve the doctor to population ratio (120,000).

(Definition of Depressed, Unserved/underserved, Hard to reach, and critical areas adapted from Targeted Areas for Development, TADS Criteria)
