<subject>SUBJECT: Revised Rules and Regulations Governing the Generic Labeling Requirements of Drug Products for Human Use</subject>


<body>
I. RATIONALE 

Article 111, Section 7 of the 1987 Philippine Constitution declares that the State recognizes the right of the people to gain information on matters of public concern, such as those relating to health and health products. 

Labels and labeling materials are the primary Sources of information for consumers. They provide useful information such as those dealing with the safe and effective use of a drug product (eg. indication(s), phannacologic class and dosage), and information dealing with quality (cg. manufacturing and expiration dates, registration number, and manufacturer). 3 

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA), as the regulatory authority of the Philippines responsible for all matters pertaining to drug products, has issued several guidelines to ensure that drug establishments provide the most accurate information relating to their products. In the course of the enforcement of these issuances, coupled with the advent of globalization and development of harmonization schemes of technical procedures and requirements applicable to the drug industry in the ASEAN region, gaps in regulations have been identiﬁed, and the need for a more transparent and clear regulatory guideline pertaining to labels has been raised. I 

Hence, this Administrative Order is issued to rationalize the regulations on labeling of drug products for human use, as well as to address the gaps and issues raised for the effective implementation of the declared policy. 

II. OBJECTIVE 

The objective of this Administrative Order is to rationalize the existing rules and regulations on generic labeling requirements of drug products, consistent with the harmonized requirements of the ASEAN Member States; thus providing an updated and comprehensive guideline. 

 
III. SCOPE 

This Administrative Order shall apply to all manufacturers and distributors (i.e. exporters, importers and wholesalers) of drug products for human use, including herbal medicines and traditionally-used herbal products. 


IV. DEFINITION OF TERMS 

For purposes of this Administrative Order, the following terms shall mean: 

1. Active Moiety - the molecule or ion, excluding those appended portions of the molecule that cause the drug to be an ester, salt (including a salt with hydrogen or coordination bonds), or other noncovalent derivative (such as complex, chelate, or clathrate) of the molecule, responsible for the physiological or pharmacological action of the drug substance. 

2. Active Pharmaceutical Ingredient (API) - a substance or compound that is intended to be used in the manufacture of a pharmaceutical product as a therapeutically active compound (ingredient). 

3. Adverse Drug Reaction (ADR) - a response to a medicine that is noxious and unintended, and which occurs at doses normally used in man. 

4. Batch — a deﬁned quantity of starting material, packaging material or product manufactured in a single or series of processes so that it can be expected to be homogeneous. (In the case of continuous manufacture, the batch must correspond to a deﬁned fraction of production, characterized by its intended homogeneity; it may sometimes be necessary to divide a batch into a number of sub-batches, which are later brought together to form a ﬁnal homogeneous batch). 

5. Batch Number - a distinctive combination of numbers and/or letters which specifically identifies a batch on the labels, the batch records, and the certiﬁcates of analysis, etc. 

6. Biological Product — any product of biological origin, prepared with biological processes, derived from human blood and plasma, or manufactured by biotechnology, consisting of substances of higher molecular weight whose purity, potency, and composition cannot readily and reliably be determined by chemical or physicochemical analysis. Examples of this group include vaccines, blood products, modiﬁed animal tissues, high molecular weight hormones, allergens, and the products of genetic engineering or other newer biotechnological techniques. This definition does not include antibiotics and substances that, although of biological origin, are of low molecular weight and can be isolated as pure substances, such as puriﬁed steroids and alkaloids 

7. Brand Name — the proprietary name assigned to the product by the Marketing Authorization Holder (MAH). 

8. Contraindication - a statement regarding the conditions wherein the use of the drug product may cause harm to the patient.
