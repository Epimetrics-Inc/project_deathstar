<subject>SUBJECT: Technical Guidelines for Implementing DOTS Strategy in Jails and Prisons</subject>

<body>
I. RATIONALE 

In 2008, it was estimated that of the total of about 130,000 prison inmates in the country, 28% or 36,000 had symptoms of TB. In a study of 7,282 inmates in five (5) jails and one (1) prison in Davao Region, the prevalence of sputum smear positive among inmates was 8.7/1,000 compared to the 2/1,000 for the general population based on the result of the 2007 National TB Prevalence Survey. Globally, the estimated number of peeple detained on any given day is over 9 million and the prevalence rate of TB in prisons usually exceeds that ofthe civilian population“. 

The increased vulnerability of this group to TB can be attributed to several factors: (1) overcrowding and lack of ventilation in many jails/prison facilities, (2) late case detection secondary to lack of access to health services and stigma, (3) lack of health human resource and trained staff servicing inmates and (4) presence of other risk factors such as malnutrition and co- morbidities. 

Considering that more than half of the inmate population are detainees awaiting case resolution and that a large majority of them shall be re-integrated with the society at large, the Department of Health (DOH) intends to implement Directly Observed Treatment Short-Course (DOTS) Strategy to this captive pepulation in order to reduce TB transmission, morbidity and mortality within jails and prisons, and to render inmates non—infectious by the time they are released to mainstream society. 

The controlled, supervised situation of the inmates injails and prisons, on the other hand, is also expected to yield success rates and cure rates that are higher than those for the civilian population. Thus, implementing DOTS Strategy in jails and prisons has the potential of significantly expediting the achievement of national and Millennium Development Goal (MDG) targets related to TB control. 

II. OBJECTIVES 

These guidelines aim to strengthen the implementation of the Comprehensive and Unified Policy (CUP) for TB Control in the Philippines (Executive Order 187 s. 2003), by providing minimum standard guidelines for integrating (DOTS) Strategy within jails/prisons. These guidelines shall become the basis for the development of specific operational guidelines by the Bureau of Corrections (BuCor) and Bureau of Jail Management and penology (BJMP) in collaboration with concerned Local Government Units (LGUs). 

III. SCOPE/COVERAGE 

The guidelines are to be used by jail and prison authorities who can comply with minimum DOTS Service requirements of the DOH. 

The implementation shall initially cover four (4) city jails, one (1) district jail and one (1) prison namely: Manila, Cebu, Davao and Antipolo City Jails, Metro Manila District Jail and New Bilibid Prison. Expansion shall be done in phases. 

IV. DEFINITION OF TERMS 

a. Casefinding — an activity to discover or find TB cases. 

b. Caseholding - an activity to treat TB cases through proper treatment regimen and health education. 

c. Detainee —— a person accused before a court or competent authority and is temporarily confined in ajail while undergoing or awaiting investigation, trial, or final judgments. 

d. DOTS Referring Jails/Prisons ~— jails/prisons providing Directly Observed Treatment (DOT) except sputum microscopy which is linked outside. 

e. DOTS Service Providing Jails/Prisons -—— jailslprisons providing DOTS services including sputum microscopy. 

f. Droplet nuclei - microscopic particles which are estimated at I—Smicrons in diameter and are produced when a person coughs, sneezes, shouts or sings. Such particles may contain the M. tuberculosis bacilli and remain suspended in the air for hours). 

g. Direct Sputum Smear Microscopy (DSSM) — is the primary diagnostic tool in NTP case finding. It serves as basis for categorizing TB symptomatics according to standard case definition, used to monitor progress of patients with sputum smear positive TB while they are receiving anti-TB treatment and confirm cure at the end oftreatment. 

h. Environmental Control Measures - these are measures that can be used in jails/prisons to reduce the concentration of droplet nuclei in the air (e.g., maximizing natural ventilation or controlling the direction of airﬂow)6. 

i. Health Promotion -—- a process of enabling people to take action to improve health. 

j. Infection Control — specific measures and work practices that reduce the likelihood of transmitting M. tuberculosis? 

k. Inmates - is a generic term used to refer to a prisoner or a detainee

l. Jail — a place for confinement for city and municipal prisoners, any fugitive from justice, detainee awaiting trial or under investigation or transfer to a National Penitentiary/Mental Institutions. It caters to detainees and inmates serving up to 3 years of imprisonment. Jails are managed by the BJMP and/or LGUs. 

m. Prison — refers to a penal establishment under the control of the BuCor. It caters to prisoner serving more than 3 years. 

n. Prisoner — an inmate who is convicted by final judgments. 

o. TB Symptomatic — any person with cough for two (2) weeks or more with or without the following symptoms: fever; chest and/or back pains not referable to any musculo- skeletal disorders; hemoptysis or recurrent blood-streaked sputum; significant weight loss; and other symptoms such as sweating, fatigue, body malaise, shortness of breath. 

p. Work Practice and Administrative Control Measures —- managerial or administrative measures which guide work practices to reduce significantly the risk ofTB transmission by preventing the generation of droplet nuclei. These include early diagnosis, prompt isolation or separation of infectious TB patients and prompt initiation of appropriate anti—TB treatmenté. 

V. GUIDING PRINCIPLES 

a. TB cannot be managed effectively in a country ifthe TB reservoir in jails/prisons is not dealt with correctly4. 

b. Jails/prisons are reservoirs of TB infection that receive TB disease; concentrate the disease; make it worse by not providing adequate case finding and treatment; create resistance through erratic or non-supervised treatment; disseminate it amongst inmates and export TB through visits and other contacts such asjail/prison staff1 . 

c. A comprehensive package of medical and administrative interventions is necessary to control TB in prisonsg. 

d. TB control in jails/prisons must be incorporated into the existing programmatic TB control strategies thru the NTP, with the DOTS Strategy as the overarching frameworkg. 

e. Inmates have the right to the same standard of health care as the people in the general community (principle of equity of care)8. 

f. Inmates have the right to avail of medical, dental and other health servicess. 

g. The inherent worth, dignity, health and safety of inmates must be respected at all timess. h. The community is a partner in the developmental processes of inmatess. 

i. A diagnosis of TB or incomplete TB treatment must never be used to delay trial, release or amnesty. It should not also bring any extra advantage to the patient compared to other - 4 inmates .

- Education of patients and increasing community awareness 

2. Environmental control measures 

b. Separation of smear positive cases until no longer infectious 

1. When feasible, a temporary holding area shall be designated for smear positive patients. 

2. To prevent overcrowding in the holding area, a repeat DSSM should be done after 2 weeks to check ifthe inmate has converted to smear negative before returning to their designated cells. 

3. Smear positive patients shall remain in the holding area until the inmate has converted to smear negative. 

4. The purpose of separating smear positive is to prevent transmission of TB to others. It shall be emphasized to the inmate that the separation is a preventive measure and not as a form of punishment. 

c. Face Masks 

1. Smear positive patients who are in the holding area shall also wear face masks. 

2. TB symptomatics and smear negative patients will remain in their assigned cells. 

3. TB symptomatics should be considered infectious until a diagnostic investigation is completed therefore; they should wear mask until result of the DSSM becomes available. Ifthe DSSM is negative, inmate shall no longer wear the mask except if persistently coughing. 

4. Smear positives and TB symptomatics/smear negative inmates but coughing persistently shall wear face masks at all times while inside the cell except during routine inmate count. The DOTS team should inform them of the importance of wearing face masks.
