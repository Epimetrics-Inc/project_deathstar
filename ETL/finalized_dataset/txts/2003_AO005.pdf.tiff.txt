<subject>Subject : Guidelines and Procedure for the institutionalization of the Department of Health Drug Consignment System</subject>

<body>
I. RATIONALE

In order to enhance the physical and financial accessibility of essential drugs and medicines (EDM) Commonly dispensed to the public as a commitment of our Government in the State of the Nation Address (SONA), the Department of Health (DOH) has explored innovative ways to achieve that commitment.

Among the courses of action that was projected to be a viable alternative that would bring fruition to the commitment, is the procurement of drugs through consignment method.

Under this scheme, DOH hospitals shall be allowed to enter into a Drug Consignment Agreement with legitimate manufacturer/supplier and with capability to meet the demands of the hospital for essential drugs and medicine in a sustainable manner.

The advantages of this scheme are:

1) It will enhance the availability of low-cost, high quality drugs and medicines in DOH hospital pharmacies, without entailing additional cost or investment on the part of the government;

2) The income that hospitals will earn from the direct sales of these drug products may be used for the improvement of hospital operations, thereby improving healthcare services;

3) Funds alloted for the procurement of supplies and medicines will be freed up and may be utilized for other equally important needs of the hospital;

4) Even with mark-up by the hospital, the prices of these consigned medicines will still be lower than in private outlets. This situation may provide healthy competition with nearby private retailers and may therefore prompt them to lower drug prices as well;

5) No budgetary allotment and notification of cash allocation is required in these transactions since payment will be based on actual drug sales of the respective hospital pharmacies, decreasing red tape involve in the use thereof;

6) Optimum waste and inventory management as a result of the mechanism to return unused medicines within the agreed period or as a consequence of the available shelf-life.

II. PURPOSE AND OBJECTIVES

The purpose of this Order is to establish guidelines and procedures to ensure the availability and relative affordability of essential drugs and medicines (EDM) through this scheme.

The objectives of this Order are as follows:

1. To provide time bound systems and procedures that would establish the DOH Drug Consignment System (DOHDCS);

2. To define the attendant roles and responsibilities of prospective Consignor (Drugs and Medicine Supplier) and Consignee (DOH hospitals);

3. To provide safeguards that would ensure that the system is within the framework of existing rules and regulations on procurement used by the Government in general and by the DOH in particular.

III. SCOPE AND COVERAGE

This Order shall be applicable to all DOH hospitals nationwide.

IV. DEFINITION OF TERMS
