<subject>SUBJECT : Guidelines on the Implementation of the Drug Test Operations Management System (DTOMIS)</subject>

<body>
I. BACKGROUND/RATIONALE

The task of regulating Drug Test Laboratories/Centers (DTL/DTC) is a function of the Department of Health in accordance with the provisions of Republic Act No. 9165 also known as "Comprehensive Dangerous Drugs Act of 2002."

Article III, "Dangerous Drug Test and Record Requirement" of the said law in particular has specifically mandated the DOH to license, accredit, and monitor Drug Test Laboratories/Centers to ensure quality of drug testing results; accredit physicians for drug dependency examination and provision of care; and establish, operate and maintain DTL/DTCs in government hospitals.

Section 6, No. 5 of the DOH Implementing Rules and Regulation governing the licensing and accreditation of DTLs/DTCs requires that the DOH to approve the Application Service Provider for effective authentication of test results and prompt interface with Information and Communication Technology (ICT) systems of Agency Data Beneficiaries of drug test results.

On August 27, 2003, the Congressional Oversight Committee on Dangerous Drugs instructed the DOH to set up a "stop gap" ICT solution within one month that will supplant the current operation of an ASP operating within the administrative and regulation framework of the Land Transportation office. As a consequence of said instruction the DOH developed the Drug Test Operations Management System (DTOMIS) software, enhanced the current available ICT infrastructure of the DOH, and trained DOH personnel strategically distributed throughout the country. The implementation of DTOMIS is a paramount thrust to reduce the cost of drug testing.

And as approved by the Dangerous Drugs Board (DDB) in its October 24, 2003 meeting the DTOMIS is hereby adopted for implementation and until such time appropriate enhancements are introduced as determined by the DOH and concurred by the DDB .

II. OBJECTIVES

The Drug Test Operation Management Information System has the
following objectives:

1. To provide interconnectivity and standardized solution for accredited DTLs/DTCs so that the results may be used by other Agencies;
2. To provide and efficient and effective system for updating, maintaining, sharing and accessing voluminous transaction data that are repeated annually;
3. To enforce standards on input, process, and output to simplify registration and results verification and monitoring;
4. To produce accurate, reliable and timely drug testing data;
5. To improve client satisfaction through better, faster, more convenient and cheaper public service;
6. To strengthen DTL/DTC quality assurance program;
7. To generate at least PhP 1 billion annual savings from the aggregate expenses of persons required to be drug tested.

III. SCOPE AND COVERAGE

This Order shall cover all Drug Test Laboratories/Centers, the Department of Health, including its Centers for Health Development (CHD) and Retained Hospitals, and the Agency Data Beneficiaries.

IV. GENERAL GUIDELINES

1. Effective 03 October 2003, the Information Management Service must assure that the DTOMIS software is deployed to all DOH trained personnel assigned at the CHDs;

2. Effective 03 October 2003, the DOH and its CHDs shall deploy the DTOMIS software to all DOH accredited DTLs/DTCs. Deployment of the software to the DTLs/DTCs includes installation, provision of minimum training and doctrine materials, and registration of Drug Test Kits. The Drug Test Results generated from the DTOMIS shall be deemed officially acceptable reckoned from this date;

3. Effective November 3, 2003, only drug test results generated by the DTOMIS shall be accepted as official by the DOH and all the Agency Data Beneficiaries. Accredited DTCs/DTLs including newly accredited ones, however, must contact the CHD under which they are regulated or the DOH Central office for the installation of the DTOMIS software and registration of drug kits onwards the subject date as a continuing process;

4. The DOH shall transfer the Security Codes for authenticating the Drug Test Results to the Head of the Agency Data Beneficiary as shall be explicitly requested by the latter. The Agency Data Beneficiary shall exert due diligence in protecting the confidentiality of the said codes and the persons under it that are authorized to have direct knowledge of the said codes. The Agency Data Beneficiary shall explicitly identify the personnel who are authorized to have direct knowledge of the said codes and must be sworn to protect their confidentiality and must be made aware of the implications and sanctions that may be imposed as a result of infidelity to hold state secret.

5. The Bureau of Health Facilities and Services, in coordination with the Information Management Service shall harmonize regulatory standards and processes with the Information and Communication Technology Intervention and other future enhancements as may be deemed appropriate.

V. AGENCY DATA BENEFICIARIES

DRUG TEST OPERATIONS AND MANAGEMENT INFORMATION SYSTEM (DTOMIS)

SOFTWARE OPERATIONS MANUAL

(as of October 3, 2003, 8:34 am.)

Developed By:

Information Management Service
Department of Health

This Software Operations Manual Is for use of Drug Test Centers' personnel who shall be responsible for encoding the drug test results and generating the necessary reports. This teaches the users on how to operate the Drug Test Operations and Management Information System (DTOMIS) Software.

1.0 INTRODUCTION TO DTOMIS

The DTOMIS is a computer-based system developed for Screening Drug Test Centers (DTC) to enable them to enter or encode drug test results of clients. It produces Drug Test Report and other statistical outputs that can be used by the screening DTC managers as basis for their decision-making in their day-to-day operations.

The DTOMIS serves as tool to facilitate the entry of drug test results, monitor pending transactions and will greatly benefit other government agencies like Land Transportation office, Philippine National Police, Department of Education and other agency data beneficiaries. They will be able to validate and/or verify the drug test results of clients through the web-based Client Verification System.

There are five (5) systems included in the DTOMIS:

a. CLIENT VERIFICATION SYSTEM. This is a web-based application system that enables the DTCs and Agency Data Beneficiaries to verify or validate if a client has pending transactions from other DTCs including the Confirmatory Laboratories and National Reference Laboratory. Clients with pending transactions are those with positive drug test results from other drug test laboratories and should not be given any drug tests until cleared of the previous transactions.

b. DRUG TEST RESULTS DATA ENTRY SYSTEM. This is an automated system that enables the Screening DTCs to enter the drug test results from the screening, confirmatory and NRL test centers. Compared to the present automated system that the Screening DTCs are using, data from the Custody Control Form can be entered into the system aside from the positive or negative results. The CCF is the standard form used to document the procedures from time of specimen collection until receipt by the laboratory. The drug test results cater to the requirements of the LTO, DOH and other agency data beneficiaries.

c. DRUG TEST REPORT GENERATION SYSTEM. This is an automated system that enables the Screening DTCs to generate the Drug Test Report (DTR), request for confirmatory drug test, client results and statistical reports.

d. DATA UPLOADING SYSTEM. This is an automated system that uploads or sends data from the Screening DTCs to the DOH. The drug test results must be send to the DOH to ensure regular update of data to provide the right information to the other DTCs.

e. SOFTWARE KEY GENERATOR. Screening DTCs are required to register all newly procured drug test kits and submits all used drug test kits for inspection to the nearest Regional or Center for Health Development (CHD) offices. The DTOMIS software will not allow DTCs to enter new transactions once all the registered drug test kits are consumed. Regularly, all newly procured drug test kits must be registered and inspected to update the software key to enable continuous use of the software.

2.0 TYPES of SCREEN

2.1 LOG-ON SCREEN

The Log-On Screen is used to enter the user identification and password. Each user is assigned a user identification and password for security purpose. The user is given three (3) tries to enter the correct user identification and password to be able to use the software.
