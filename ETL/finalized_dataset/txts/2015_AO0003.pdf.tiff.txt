<subject>SUBJECT: Rescission of the Administrative Order No. 2011 — 0014 dated 15 September 2011 entitled “Guidelines on the Certification of Health Facilities with Basic Emergency Obstetrics and Newborn Care BEmONC Capacity</subject>
<body>

The certiﬁcation of health facilities with basic emergency obstetrics and newborn care by the Centers for Health Development was sought in the last quarter of 2011as an interim measure that shall be implemented for 1 year (covering the period January to December 2012). This measure was meant to accomplish the following results: 1) birthing facilities are granted with automatic MCP (maternity care package) accreditation by PhilHealth, and 2) increase facility deliveries. Both results are viewed to (contribute to the reduction of maternal and newborn death. 

With the current DOH licensing of Birthing Centers (A0 2012-0012) and the PhilHealth MCP accreditation protocols that require the presentation of documents and other pieces of evidence of the health facility’s BEmONC capability there is no need for the Regional Ofﬁces Technical Division to conduct a certiﬁcation activity of birthing facilities. In this regard, Administrative Order No. 201 1-0014 is hereby rescinded 

All Technical Division staff of DOH Regional Ofﬁces shall not be required to issue Certiﬁcates of Compliance to birthing facilities 

This Order shall take effect immediately.
