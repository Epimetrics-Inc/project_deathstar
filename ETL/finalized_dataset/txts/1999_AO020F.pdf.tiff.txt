<subject>SUBJECT: Guidelines for the Release and Utilization of Integrated Community Health Services Project (ICHSP) Funds to the Regional Health Office</subject>

<body>

RATIONALE

The Integrated Community Health Services Project (ICHSP) is a foreign-assisted project of the Department of Health funded out of a loan from the Asian Development Bank (ADB), a grant from the Australian Agency for International Development (AusAID) and a counterpart of the Philippine government. This Project is aimed to improve capabilities of LGUs, communities and NGOs to plan, manage, monitor and ﬁnance health programs, to develop provincial health sub-systems (health services planning, health care financing, human resource development, hospital regulations and management) for efficient local management and delivery of health services and to strengthen DOH capability to implement and support the sub-systems. The Project is implemented in six pilot provinces namely Apayao, Kalinga, Guimaras, Palawan, South Cotabato and Surigao del Norte. ICSHP has three components namely, the Community Health Delivery System, the Provincial Health Delivery Support and the DOH and RFO Capability Strengthening.

The recently concluded Joint Donor Supervision Mission pointed out the need to involve the DOH Regional Health Offices in the overall Project implementation given a milieu that the re-structured Department of Health defines a stronger Regional Health Office. As a precursor to putting on board the participation of the Regional Health Office in the overall frame of ICHSP implementation, the Project is supportive of the thrust to strengthen this organizational unit in the Department. The RFO is envisioned to be the operations center or unit of the Department at the periphery that will implement comprehensive technical assistance to local government units as well as collaborate with other stakeholders and partners in the delivery of health services namely - community organizations, non—government organizations and private sector.

It is in this context that ICHSP is providing funding assistance to the Regional Health Offices of CAR, IV, VI, XI and Caraga in order to (I) support the implementation of activities that will enhance the capability of RHO personnel in project and program development and management, (ii) ensure that the RHO point persons will be able to anchor the implementation of the different health management sub-systems in the Project provinces and (iii) ensure that the RHO will be able to play a lead role in the replication of the Project in the other provinces.

This Guidelines is issued to prescribe standard operating procedures for the releases, utilization and reporting of ICHSP funds (MOOE only) from the Department of Health Central Office pursuant to the Joint Circular No. 2-96 dated November 29, 1996 of the Department of Budget and Management and the National Economic and Development Authority providing for the release and utilization of funds under the LGEF.
