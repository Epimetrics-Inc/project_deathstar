<body>

I. RATIONALE 

Administrative Order No. 83-B series of 1984 was promulgated governing the Rules and. Regulations for the Labelling of Pro-packaged Food Products Distributed in the Philippines to establish standards and quality measures for food; to implement the policy of the State to ensure safe and good quality supply of food; and to regulate the production, sale and trafﬁc of the same to protect the health of the people. 

With the increasing trade of prepackaged food in the country, its safety must at all times be assured. One effective national food safety and control system is consumer information about the food product through its label. 

Product label is the most readily available material to inform the consumer about the product contents, shelf life and traceability, among others. It protects against dishonest or misleading advertising or promotion, and facilitates sound choice to acquire the knowledge necessary to be an informed consumer. 

Accordingly, with the aim to provide coherence in the Food and Drug Administration's regulatory system for food establishments and prepackaged food products, this Order is hereby issued amending for this purpose certain provisions of Administrative Order No. 88-13» S. 1984 or the “Rules and Regulations Governing the Labeling of Prepackaged Food Products Distributed in the Philippines” and for other purposes. 

II. OBJECTIVES 

A. To promulgate rules and regulations on the revised labeling guidelines of prepackaged food products in order to protect the consumer against hazards to health and safety and provide information and education to facilitate sound choice in the proper exercise of their rights 

B. To establish provisions on the exemption to the requirements of labeling of prepackaged food products which are, in accordance with the practice of trade, to be processed, labeled, or repacked in substantial quantities at establishments other than those where originally processed or packed

2) If two or more food additives are present, their names shall be given in the form of a list. The list shall be in the order of the proportion by weight which each food additive bears to the total contents of the container, the food additive present in the greatest proportion by weight being listed ﬁrst. Where one or more of the food additives is subject tota quantitative limitation in a food covered by a Codex standard, the quantity or proportion of that additive may be stated. 

3) If food ingredients are part of the preparation, they shall be declared in the list of ingredients in descending order of proportionIn the case of mixtures of ﬂavourings, the name of each ﬂavouring present in the mixture need not be printed.

This provision does not apply to ﬂavour modiﬁers, but does apply to “herbs” and “spices”, wherein generic expressions may be used where appropriate. 


4) All food additives shall carry an expiration date which shall signify that beyond this date the effectivity of the additive for its intended use is diminished. 

5) The words “For Food Use” or a statement substantially similar thereto shall appear in a prominent position on the label.

2) for solid food additives, other than those sold in tablet form, by weight; 

3) for semi-solid or viscous food additives, either by weight or volume; 

4) for food additives sold in tablet form, by weight together with the number of tablets in the package.
