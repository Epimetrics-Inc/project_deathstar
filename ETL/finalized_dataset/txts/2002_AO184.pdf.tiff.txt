To formulate Work and Financial plans relevant with the current thrusts and budget level of the DOH for 2003.

B. Specific

1. To focus financial allocations on DOH Thrust and Priorities for CY 2003 for maximum impact;
2. Identify activities requiring further mobilization of manpower; and
3. To synchronize operations through a calendar of national events;

III. FRAMEWORK FOR CY 2003 WORK AND FINANCIAL PLAN PREPARATION

A. Policy Framework

The following policies shall continue to be used as basis for plan preparation/execution:

1. Medium Term Philippine Development Plan for 1999-2004
2. Fulfillment of the National Objectives for Health;
3. The National Expenditure Program 2003 in the transition to its enactment as CY 2003 General Appropriations Act and its Special provisions related to health (Annex A);
4. The DOH Strategic Plans for 2004 and beyond (Annex B);

B. Priority Focus

Priorities for the year shall focus on the DOH Thrusts for CY 2003, discussed in the 6th National Staff Meeting in Tagum, Davao del Norte, namely:

1. Focus on Six (6) Priorities

1.1 Infectious Diseases

This includes improvement of tuberculosis case detection and cure rates, and. control of rabies through advocacy for dog control.

1.2. Child Health

Focus will be on: (1) Immunization, especially nationwide measles campaign in order to bring up measles coverage to 90-95% moving towards measles elimination; and (2) interconnectedness of advocacy and enforcement of Food Fortification (Asin Law and Vitamin A).

1.3 Women's Health

Strengthening family planning as a health intervention and not merely as an intervention for population control will be emphasized. This includes mainstreaming of natural family planning, advocacy for voluntary surgical sterilization and making available the whole spectrum of family planning services where couples can choose.

1.4 Healthy Lifestyles

Emphasis will be on: (1) Smoking Cessation, anchored on the Framework Convention for Tobacco Control, which is expected to be signed on May 2003 in Geneva and for ratification by the Philippine Senate; and (2) nationwide advocacy of Diet and Physical activities under the banner of a "healthy people for a strong republic"

1.5 Gamot na Mura Abot-kaya

Provision of low cost medicines to strategic sites to include the most populous areas; This will be done by selecting 10-15 hospitals in these areas, increasing the volume of low-priced medicine from various sources and making sure that medicines are available 7 days a Week in these hospitals, in order to generate a greater impact.

1.6 National Health Insurance Program

This will focus on broadening the reach, in terms of ensuring re-enrollments, enhancing benefits and improving Philhealth-DOH-LGU coordination. PhilHealth and LGU shall provide their respective counterpart contribution for premium subsidy to Indigency Program. The DOH, through the CHD shall provide advocacy, capacity building and technical assistance related to promotion of National Health Insurance Program.

2. Focus on Systems

Expansion of HSRA implementation and strengthening capability of partners for sustainability will continue. Priority should be given to the activities included in the HSRA implementation plan (AO No 37, s. 2001). Milestones for 2003 for convergence sites and institutional activities should be met (Annex C);

3. Focus on NSES

Ongoing Health Pledges in the National Socio-Economic Summit Pact shall be continued (Annex D).

4. Focus on Standards of Affordability, Quality, and Accessibility (AQUA)

Major Final Outputs on thrusts should promote Affordability, Quality and Accessibility of health services, products and resources. Because of limited resources, Efficiency shall also be a priority.

Hence prioritizations of activities outside of priority focus should consider Public Investment Criteria of Cost-Benefit, Cost-Effectiveness, Externalities of the Intervention, Legal Imperatives of the Intervention, and Implication of Inaction (Annex E).

4. Central Offices and Center for Health Development (excluding CHD Hospitals) shall set aside 10% of their total MOOE as management reserves for unforeseen and unanticipated demands for CY 2003, utilization of which shall be subject to the approval of the Secretary of Health.

A Work and Financial Plan will cover each of the P/AIP in the NEP. Officers responsible for plan preparation should ensure that their plans include program funds for all activities In exemption, CHDs should have only one WFP, but a separate page indicating clear totals for each P/A/P line entry.

8. Heads of implementing levels (CHDs and Regional Hospitals) should be guided to ensure that their plans cover the costs of activities shifted to their respective area of responsibility (Annex F and F.1).

Annex E

Public Investment Criteria

1. Cost-Benefit Ratio of the intervention to achieve the following:

a. Prevent illness, disability, death
b. Restore the quality of life in case of disability
c. Reduce the financial burden to: 

1) government services
2) family/individual

This is a comparison of the costs of the inputs versus the cost of the benefits, which arise from the inputs. The bigger the benefits vis-a-vis the costs, the better the cost-benefit ratio. There is available literature where researchers quantify cost-benefit ratios for specific interventions.

2. Cost - Effectiveness of the intervention to achieve 1a, b, c.

This is a comparison of the costs of alternative interventions to arrive at the same outcomes or benefits. The lower cost interventions for achieving similar outcomes would be preferable from an economic viewpoint.

3. Externalities of the intervention

This is whether the intervention has favourable impact beyond the population being provided the intervention. The larger the externalities, the better In terms of public health impact.

For example, by treating sputum-infective TB patients, we not only cure these patients, we prevent spread to at least 15 others over a period of one year. As an intervention, DOTS would thus have high externalities.

In contrast, dialysis would have relatively small externalities because the benefits accrue solely to the patient (although presumably, his family might benefit from the prolongation of the patient's life assuming he was still productive.)

4. Legal imperatives of the intervention

Does the intervention comply with certain established laws e.g. Use of iodized salt, Milk Code, the Generics Law. if there are such laws, government should implement them.

In the absence of such laws, are there ethical reasons for implementing an intervention? This area is often controversial and public health authorities must determine their course of action in dialogue with all interested parties For example, although the Catholic Church does not sanction it, surgical means of contraception are being practiced In government facilities.

5. Consequences of No Action (non-implementation of an intervention) - are these consequences favorable, neutral, or detrimental to the public interest?

For example, no action against the threat of the mutant poliovirus could have resulted in devastating consequences for the polio eradication program, having national and global consequences.

No action on the registration of Postinor would have political consequences either way. Would it impact on the ability of women and couple's to practice family planning is a debatable issue.

Scoring System:

1. Cost-benefit ratio: high, medium, low
2. Cost-effectiveness: high, medium, low
3. Externalities: high, medium, low
4. Legal imperatives: Yes or No or Ethical imperatives: Yes or No
5. Consequence of No Action: Detrimental, Neutral, Favorable

Points:
High: 5 pts
Medium: 2 pts
Low: 0 pts
Yes: Legal - 5 pts; Ethical - 3 pts; No: O pts.
Detrimental: 5 pts.
Neutral: 2 pts.
Favorable: 0 pts

Interpretation:

25-20 pts Intervention is of high public health importance
19-11 pts Intervention is of middling or doubtful value. Starting or continuing it in light of scarce resources may be unwise
&lt; 10 pts W would do well to drop this intervention altogether
