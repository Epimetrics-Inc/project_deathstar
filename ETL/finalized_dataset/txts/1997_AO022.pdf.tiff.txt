<body>
 
In conformity with the Joint CSC-DBM Joint Circular No. 2-97 dated June 25, 1997, all government officials and employees in the career and non-career service, whether permanent, provisional,temporary or casual, shall be allowed to monetize a maximum of thirty (30) day/s vacation leave credits subject to the following policy and guidelines:


A. POLICY 

1. Any official or employee shall be allowed to monetize only once a year. However, for 1997, those Who have already monetized ten (10) working days may be alloWed to monetize the balance of twenty (20) working days provided there shall remain no less than five (5) days vacation leave to his credit after monetization.

2. Said official or employee shall have accumulated no less than 15 days vacation leave credits, in which case he/she can monetize no more than ten (10) days.

3. The official or employee who availed of this privilege shall still go on a five-day forced leave pursuant to EO 1077 dated June 9, 1980. 

4. Payment or the monetized leave credits shall be charged against the savings of the Department. In this light, employees holding the positions below Salary Grade (SG) 19 shall be given preference.

5. Inasmuch as the funding for the grant of this privilege is charged against the Department’s savings which are usually determined during the last quarter of the budget year, actions for the monetization shall not be made earlier than 1st of October. 


B. GUIDELINES

1.0 On Application for Monetization

1.1 It shall be made anytime during the year but not later than 30th of September. Nevertheless, only for this year the application for monetization will be accepted until November 29 to allow officials and employees to enjoy bigger money value of the monetized leave credits caused by the full implementation of salary increase effective November 1997.

1.2 The prescribed leave form (CSC Form No. 6 revised 1984) will be used for the purpose.

1.3 The official /employee-applicant shall submit the application form in duplicate to the Personnel Division for certification of leave credit balance. The applicant should be duly recommended by the concerned Head of Offices, otherwise it will not be processed accordingly.

1.4 Upon certification of leave credit balance, the Personnel Division shall endorse the application form to the Undersecretary/Assistant Secretary concerned for approval, afterwhich, the same shall be forwarded to the Finance Service for payroll preparation/payment.

2.0 On Payment of Monetized Leave Credits

2.1 In the event that the savings will not be adequate to pay the total amount of the monetized leave credits of all applicants, the Finance Service will prioritize the payment of those employees—applicants who are holding the positions with SG 18 and below.

More specifically, preference shall be given to those who are holding positions with the lowest salary grade. Thus, payment shall be from the lowest to the highest SG of position held.

2.2 In that case, the Finance Service shall, prior to payment, furnish Personnel Division list of applicants who may not be included/accommodated in the pay1011 so that these concerned officials/employees will be informed accordingly.

2.3 The formula to be used in computing the Money Value (MV) of the monetized leave credits shall be as follows:

C. MONITORING 

After the employees have been duly paid, the Finance Service shall immediately furnish Personnel Division certified true copy of the payroll, as well as return all applications that were not favorably considered for payment, for purposes of counter checking and/or causing necessary corrections on employee’s/officials’ leave records.

2. The Personnel Division shall send concerned Heads of Offices certification of updated leave credit balances of employees who availed of the privilege and correspondingly received the money value of their monetized leave credits for reference.

This Order takes effect immediately.
