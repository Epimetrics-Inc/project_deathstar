<subject>SUBJECT: National Framework For Quality in Health </subject>


<body>
I. RATIONALE 

Quality improvement in health system needs to be organized systematically and appropriately linked to accreditation and safety so as to bring about genuine health systems reform. Licensing and accreditation is usually the entry point in fostering a structured and systematic quality improvement process and a motivator that lead to common understanding and language on quality issues. It shall uphold quality literacy at all levels and promote a just culture and policy environment. Work in this direction has been pursued through the pioneering efforts of the Technical Working Group of the Ad,- Hoc Committee on Quality Assurance spearheaded by the Philippine Health Insurance Corporation (PHIC) in cOOperation with the Department of Health, World Health Organization '(WHO) and the German Technical Cooperation (GTZ). In that light there is a need to adapt the National Frammzvork for Quality in Health and to eventually translate it into operational guidelines with a complementary organizational structure to ensure its effective and efﬁcient implementation. 

The concept of quality in health care delivery has been changing over the past years. Emphasis has moved from “quality control and assessment” to, the deﬁnition of agreed and valid standards, systematic and reliable measurement of performance, implementing action for change, repeated measurement and continuous improvement in a cycle. 

Improving the quality of medical care has become a major issue for all health care systems in developed and developing countries alike, in response to increasing evidence that the quality of care is suboptimal in terms of the health outcomes, standards attained, the degree of variability, and the level of accountability of health professionals. The success of quality initiatives lies in producing change the way people and organizations work rather than concentrating on standards and measurements alone. - 

II. BACKGROUND: 

Over the past years, the health sector has shown commitment to improve the quality of medical care delivery through the various modes of standard setting, policy issuances, mechanisms for incentives and disincentives and ﬁnally, regulation. Among the initiatives are: 

1. Republic Act No. 9013 “The Philippine Quality Award Act” 

2. Service Delivery Excellence for RHUs and BHSs (Sentrong Sigla) 

3. FOURmulaONE for Health 

4. Issuances such as: 
- Administrative Order No. 2008-0023 “National Policy on Patient Safety” 
- Administrative Order No. 161 “Institutionalizing Quality Management System in Government”, issued by the Ofﬁce of the President of the Philippines on October-5, 2006. 
- Executive Order No. 605 “Institutionalizing the structure, mechanisms, and standards to implement the quality management improvement for the purpose of amending AO 161”, Feb 23, 2007. 
- Administrative Order No. 2006-0002 “Establishment of the Continuing Quality Improvement (CQI) Program and Committee in DOH Hospitals” 
- Bureau Order No. 2006-050 “Creation of a Quality Control Committee in the Bureau of Health Devices and Technology” ' 
- Administrative Order No. l7-B s. 2003 “Philippine Quality in Health Program  2003-2007: Five Year Strategic Plan” 
- Executive Order No. 102 Is. 1999 “Redirecting the Functions and Operations of the DOH. 
- Manual of Standards for Hospital organization, management and operations. 

5. The PhilHealth Benchbook standards for accreditation of hospitals and outpatient facilities and the issuance of PhilHealth Circular no. 12 32006 “Requirement for a Continuous Quality Improvement Program in Accreditation of Hospitals” 

6. The establishment of national organizations on quality such as the Philippine Society for Quality (PSQua) and Philippine Council for Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations (PCAHO). 

7. The active recognition for quality by private hospitals through certiﬁcation from either local or international accreditation bodies. 

The PhilHealth Benchbook pilot test in 2008 has revealed: “Despite the recognized importance of quality, there have been really few sustained efforts in the Philippines. The quality of health care service and management system has been widely deﬁcient. Government and private hospitals share similar deﬁciencies in areas concerning patient’s rights and organizational ethics, information management, safe practice and environment, and improving performance (PhilHealth Benchbook pilot test, 2008). 

In 2001, according to the World Bank, “The quality of service varies between different types of health facilities with the facilities providing better quality of service to be more heavily utilized by the individuals from the higher income groups. Public health facilities such as the rural health units and barangay health stations are generally perceived to provide low quality health services. Few have emphasized the quality of services and most systematic efforts to improve quality based on ﬁnding about the delivery process have been limited to health facilities with adequate resources”.  

There is a general perception that the Philippines currently have fragmented planning, funding and management of the quality initiatives. This is attributed to lack of multisectoral collaboration and political support within the health system. In view of this, there is a need for a quality framework to actively harmonize and coordinate current and future efforts at all levels in the implementation of quality assurance and improvement programs in health care. 

III. COVERAGE AND SCOPE 

This framework shall apply to all stakeholders in the health sector and all other sectors that have an impact on health. 

IV. DEFINITION OF QUALITY OF CARE 

In the Philippines, quality in health care shall refer to the degree of excellence in health services and health-related services and products consistent with currently accepted standards that increase the desired health outcomes and meet clients stated or implied needs. Quality is realized through continuously improving the following dimensions: patient- centeredness/responsiveness, effectiveness, accessibility, safety, efﬁciency, and equity. 

V. THE NATIONAL FRAMEWORK FOR QUALITY IN HEALTH 

A. Vision 

Quality health for all 

B. Mission 

Ensure safe, effective, efﬁcient, responsive, equitable, and accessible health services and products in the Philippines, especially for the poor and vulnerable. 

C. Goal 

This National Framework for Quality Health shall provide guidance for comprehensive and strategic approach for quality-related activities consistent with the national health goals and reforms to ensure better health outcomes, client satisfaction, and ﬁnancial risk protection. 

D. Strategies 

The strategies to achieve the goal are as follows: 

1. Enhance client and community satisfaction; 

2. Institutionalize continuous quality improvement in health care at all levels of the health system; - 

3. Harmonize all initiatives and interventions that have direct and indirect impact on quality to achieve the desired health outcome; and 

4. Guide future policy development related to quality of care. 

E. Quality Framework for the Health Sector 

<image>figure_1.png</image>
 

Country Level/Impact. All quality related interventions and investments shall contribute to the attainment of the national objectives of better health outcome, poverty reduction and improved client satisfaction with health services and products. 

Multisectoral. Achieving the above goals will rely on contributions from the health sector as well as the improvements of non-health care determinants of health, for instance economic status, education, housing, water and sanitation, etc. 

System Level/Outcomes. Existing and future quality related interventions and investments shall deﬁne and set performance targets with regards to their contribution to one or more system level quality dimensions: 

-Eﬂectiveness, delivering health care and products that improve health outcomes for individuals and communities, based on need as supported by evidence-based knowledge. 
- Eficiency, delivering health care and products in a manner which maximizes resource use and avoid waste (technical efﬁciency); resources are used appropriately to ensure optimum beneﬁts for patients and the population (allocative efﬁciency). 
- Responsiveness and patient-centeredness, health care that establishes a partnership among practitioners and their families to ensure that preferences and aspirations of individual service users and the cultures of their communities are taken into account; health care which is responsive to and respectful of the patient’s values and choices to promote patient satisfaction at every health care encounter. 
- Safety, delivering health care and products which minimize risks and harm to service and medical product users; health care and products that ensure that the patients and staff do not suffer undue harm from the treatment itself and from the manner it was given. 
- Access, ability of the people to obtain health care and products that are timely, geographically and ﬁnancially reasonable, socio-culturally sensitive and provided in a setting where skills and resources are appropriate to medical need; 
- Equity, the extent to which a health system does not vary in quality and deals fairly with the distribution of health care and its beneﬁts to the people regardless of socio— economic status, religion, gender, race, ethnicity, political inclination, or geographical location. Further, equity implies considerations of fairness so that in some circumstances, individuals will receive more care than others to reﬂect differences. in their ability to beneﬁt or in their particular needs. 

An additional priority system level outcome is effective ﬁnancial risk protection preventing clients from sliding into poverty or aggravating poverty due to ill health. This is closely linked to the quality dimension of efﬁciency trying to reduce inefﬁcient out—of-pocket spending, over—production of services, etc. 

Reform Level/Outputs. The deliverables of any quality intervention shall be directly linked to reform objectives and performance indicator framework (e.g. ME3 indicator framework of FourmulaOne). 

Organizations and People. All quality related interventions and investments shall ensure broad stakeholder involvement and clearly deﬁne stakeholder roles, responsibilities and contributions.

A mechanism shall be identiﬁed to set strategic direction, targets and approaches adapted to local conditions. All quality related interventions and investments shall be monitored and evaluated to broaden the evidence-base and to ensure the effectiveness and sustainability of chosen approaches. 

VI. GENERAL PRINCIPLES 

1. Quality health care is embedded on the following values: 0 Health is a basic human right and shall be the concern of all. 0 The health needs of the poor, marginalized, and vulnerable groups shall be a priority in quality—related activities. 0 Protection and promotion of a balanced and healthful ecology. . 

2. The establishment and maintenance of a culture of quality shall begin with the leadership of each organization involved in health care. 

3. The establishment of an enabling and supportive environment for quality in health care services and products is realized through: 

4. Effective methods for continuous quality improvement which should be systematically promoted at the national and local level are consistent with experience and scientiﬁc evidence. 

-Collaboration with other sectors for the provision of adequate social services and improved quality of life for all. 
- Recognition of the indispensable role of the private sector. 
- Honesty, integrity, accountability and transparency in the delivery of health services. 
- Development of an effective reporting and monitoring system. 
- Financing mechanism that shall promote and leverage quality health care. 

4. The ultimate goal or outcome of the policy is improvement of the health status, ﬁnancial risk protection, and client satisfaction. 

VII. APPROACHES TO QUALITY 

The successful introduction and development of quality systems is achieved through combination of approaches, such as the following: 

1. Empowerment of consumers 

a. Promotion of patient rights and responsibilities. Patients who are made aware of their entitlements to health care and social rights will ultimately learn to increase their level of expectation from health providers and be given the opportunity to participate in their care. 

b. Provision of information on quality. To ensure that all stakeholders are informed, a national report on the state of health care quality shall be issued. Other relevant information materials on quality may be disseminated as needed. 

c. Promotion of the establishment of health consumers groups. 

d. Involvement of existing lay organizations, labor unions and community-based organizations by the local government units (LGUs). 

e. Universal social health insurance coverage and improved ﬁnancial risk protection. 

2. Institutional regulation and accreditation 

a. Licensing of health facilities. Health care facilities shall be licensed to ensure that minimum standards shall be met to protect public health and safety. 

b. Accreditation. Accreditation shall be a key mechanism whereby an organization will be assessed to determine compliance with agreed appropriate standards on quality. It shall be based on a credible assessment process. The standards used shall be guided by international standards, adapted to local setting, and shall apply to all facilities (public and private, urban and rural, or irrespective of resource level). Facilities that do not qualify for accreditation shall be given the option for enrollment in a guided quality improvement program (graded and facilitated accreditation approach). 

The PhilHealth Benchbook standards will serve as the yardstick for assessing and measuring quality of health care services by health providers accredited with PhilHealth. 

3. Improvement of quality of clinical practice 

a. Evidence-based guideline development. Development and application of practice guidelines and pathways in partnership with professional organizations and the academe to ensure standardized health facility processes and clinical management of patients. These documents shall reﬂect the best available scientiﬁc evidence and up-to-date applicability in the local setting. 

b. Assessment of local clinical practice. Practice shall be evaluated against expectations, whether stated or unstated, shall involve multi-disciplinary teams, rather than individuals or single specialties. 

Approaches include: 

- Medical audit. Patient—focused audit process involving doctors, nurses, and ' other clinicians who comprise the clinical care team to provide a comprehensive and step—by-step analysis of quality of care. 

- Utilization review. Evaluate formally the necessity, appropriateness and efﬁcient use of medical services, procedures and/ or facilities on a prospective, concurrent or retrospective basis, including but not limited to examination of the clinical application of medical knowledge as revealed by medical records. 

- Complaints analysis. Analyze the expressions of dissatisfaction of patients and staff to identify areas for improvement. 

- Expanded incident monitoring. Deviations from expected or standard practice are identiﬁed/reported, processed, and analyzed to prevent recurrence. 

- Morbidity and mortality meetings. Timely review of deaths and adverse outcomes among patients of a speciﬁed clinical group or specialty. Review team should be multidisciplinary and include all who are involved in the care of the concerned group of patients. 

- Adverse event monitoring. Identify any untoward, undesirable event occurring to a patient, an employee or a visitor in a health care organization caused by medical management rather than by the underlying condition of the patient. 

- Sentinel event monitoring. Identify potentially serious breaches in practice standards. These breaches are unexpected variations which may have resulted in either death or serious physical or psychological injury. 

c. Mechanism for feedback and for corrective action. A mechanism to improve the quality of service shall be established to periodically inform health care providers and the public of the performance of health care providers. As the need arises and based on data obtained, remedial measures shall be imposed if there is deﬁciency in the delivery of cost-efﬁcient and quality services. 

4. Professional development 

a. Licensure for health professionals. License to practice ensures that only competent professionals are allowed to provide health care to the population. 

b. Capability building. Provision of continuing education and training for professional development of health staff, at all levels, to keep them updated with current trends in clinical knowledge and in health care management. 

c. Individual healthcare provider competence. An appropriate mix of tools related to producing individual competence (e.g. selection and reoruitment of appropriate staff, credentialing, clinical supervision, and continuing education) shall be critical in quality improvement. 

d. Professional self-regulation. Professional regulatory bodies shall identify mechanisms needed to review and improve the performance of their peers. 

5. Institutional management and development 

a. The capacity of the organization in planning, policy development, implementation, supervision and performance evaluation and management shall be strengthened, deﬁning the lines of accountability throughout the health care system. 

b. The leaders and decision-makers shall be guided to organize, support and monitor internal quality systems and manage appropriate change. Technical and logistic support for improvement at the peripheral level shall help ensure consistent attainment of quality targets. 

c. A reasonable and timely upgrading of health facilities shall help ensure that the basic requirements for the provision of care are in place. They include support for organizational systems, change management, self—regulation and performance management. 

6. Institutionalization of quality improvement initiatives 

a. Leadership commitment and management responsibility. Leadership, commitment and active involvement of the top management are essential for developing and maintaining an effective and efﬁcient management system for quality in health care. Implementing managers shall be empowered by providing them information on quality and choices of methods and tools for quality management and improvement, as well as the sustainability of quality initiatives. 

b. Quality Plan. The top management should prepare a quality plan with input from various levels of staff. The plan should be dynamic, reviewed regularly and modiﬁed when necessary. 

- Health service planning. Needs assessment, priorities, objectives, monitoring and evaluation, change management and feedback shall be integrated to health service planning, and performance improvement.

- Participatory approach to quality care. Health care is complex and opportunities and problems arise in health care are multi-faceted in nature. Team approach is a must in attempting to improve quality in health care.

- . Systems development. Health care quality is system—oriented. Since systems are comprised of structure, processes and outcomes, health care quality focuses on studying the elements of each of these components and ﬁnd ways to improve their status collectively.

- Standard Setting. Setting standards is a necessary component of deﬁning and improving quality of health care. Through setting of standards an organization can deﬁne what it expects for the inputs, processes and outcomes of the services it provides. These standards shall be continually updated based on the best available evidence and tested for its applicability in the local setting.

- Performance Monitoring. Monitoring should be undertaken at speciﬁed time interval on a regular basis with the intention to identify deﬁciency and opportunities for improvement. 

- Identifying and Acting on Opportunities for Improvement. Quality - improvement initiatives ensure the processes that are in place are capable of meeting the expectations of the clients. 

7. Human resource management The recruitment, training, allocation and development of competent staff are keys to quality management. This should include: 

a. Mechanisms for needs-based human resource planning 
b. Rational staff assignment and transfer policy 
c. System for performance monitoring and evaluation 
d. Performance-based awards and incentives 
e. Exploring other modes of employment and service delivery to ﬁll existing gaps (contractual employment, outsourcing, Public-Private-Partnership schemes) 
f. Need-based training programs like CME 
g. Evaluation of training programs 

In the process of implementing quality health care, all personnel in the organization need to be aware and inform of the intention, so that they will be motivated and understand how they can contribute towards improving quality. Training for performance speciﬁcations shall include target setting, indicator development, and evidence-baSed participatory improvement. 

8. Data and information management 

Health facilities should provide accurate, complete and timely data by which clinical and organizational performance can be measured in all levels of care. Research agenda should include studies that will improve decision-making at all levels from patient’s, to clinicians, to health care system leaders, to public and private policy makers. Examples should include: health services studies, clinical care studies, biomedical studies, and technology assessment. 

9. Incentives and rewards for quality care. - 

A highly motivated workforce is therefore indispensable to the achievement of sustained change and results. Rewards may either be extrinsic or intrinsic or even both. The former is usually given by the management while the latter is the satisfaction received in the process of performing a particular action. 

10. Health care ﬁnancing 

a. Universal health coverage to achieve ﬁnancial risk protection against the costs of health care 

b. Provision of speciﬁed beneﬁt packages based on diseases and procedures having the most signiﬁcant health economic impact. . 

c. Partnerships between the government and private sector to co—fund health care. 

d. Funding of priority for national and local health programs and activities such as LGU enrollment in sponsored program and investment in public health facilities.

b. Accreditation and certiﬁcation 

12. Advocacy and social marketing for quality 

Social marketing shall change the behavior of providers and patients towards a culture of quality. Advocacy should be integrated within the political, economic, social, cultural, environmental, behavioral, and biological systems. Key strategies are: implementation of information, education, and communication (IEC) and behavior change communications (BCC). 

13. Inter-agency collaboration and networking 
Formal and informal working relationships shall be established jointly or share responsibility and resources among the different agencies/ stakeholders to achieve the common goals of quality. '
