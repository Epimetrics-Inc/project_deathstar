<subject>SUBJECT: List of Core Essential Drugs for Procurement by the Department of Health</subject>

<body>

I. RATIONALE: 

Provision of essential drugs to targetted Sectors of the population is a serious concern for public health programs. There are not enough funds alloted for drugs. Moreover, given major health problems, increased drug requirements is beyond the capacity of existing procurement and distribution mechanism. In view of this, a two-pronged approach will be adopted. This approach aims to establish the list of core essential public health drugs and institutionalize a mechanism for the periodic review and updating of such a list.

1. A list of core essential drugs will be established. The core essential drugs are drugs which are needed to address the most serious public health concerns and will therefore have to be provided in full supply nationwide, particularly at peripheral health facilities. This will serve to channel scarce resources on priority concerns and ensure that programs aimed at addressing them will operate at peak levels. This will also serve to limit the number of inventory items to be handled by the public health logistics system, thereby allowing for greater efficiencies.

2. A Local Government Essential Drug Distribution System (LGEDDS) will be designed and implemented to efficiently distribute and track the core essential drugs down to the municipal level. The system will make use of the provincial delivery teams organized and trained under the Contraceptive Distribution Logistics Management, Information System (CDLMIS). The LGEDDS is envisioned to be patterned after the successful CDLMIS. This activity will be carried out as a subcomponent of the Womenâ€˜s Health and Safe Motherhood Project.


II. THE CORE ESSENTIAL DRUG LIST

The core essential drug list resulted from a series of consultations done with the different public health program managers and was approved by the Undersecretary for Public Health Services.

The DOIH core essential drugs are as follows:

1. Vitamin A Capsules

7. Cotrimoxazole tablets 
8. Contraceptives - condom
9. Injectable contraceptives - Depotmedroxiprogesterone Acetate

All other orders and issuances inconsistent with this Administrative Order are hereby rescinded.
