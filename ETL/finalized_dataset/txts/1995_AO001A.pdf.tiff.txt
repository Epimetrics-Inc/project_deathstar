<subject>SUBJECT: Transitory Guidelines for the Utilization of DOH procured Anti-Tuberculosis Drugs: Blister Packed and Loose Preparations, for Short Course Regimens of Patient Classifications</subject>


<body>
 

This guideline is issued as a temporary reference and guide to the allocation, distribution and consequent utilization of anti-tuberculosis drugs distributed by the Department of Health central ofﬁce to DOH Regional Integrated Field Ofﬁces and non-government agencies, pending the Circulation of approved new Manual of Operations of the National Tuberculosis Control Program, as follows:



Rationale

Current procurement records show that the cost of short course chemotherapy using blister-packed triple drug regimen consisting of rifampicin (450 mg. O.D.), pyrazinamide (1000 mg. O.D.) and INH (300 mg. O.D.) during the 2-month intensive phase and rifampin and INH (same dosages) during the 4-month maintenance phase, has considerably gone down and has become cheaper than the standard regimen consisting of one year treatment with NIH and streptomycin or INH and ethambutol. While the short course regimen costs P497.00 per patient, standard regimen cost P704.00. Thus, the DOH is shifting to short course chemotherapy for the different types of TB cases.

Case holding by health workers, compliance of TB patients and resultant cure are more likely expected if done only for a duration or 6 months and when using more, drugs in this case three instead of two during the ﬁrst few months. Studies also show that regimens containing rifampicin, isoniazid and pyrazinamide result to higher cure rates and lower relapse rates, than the standard combination of isoniazid and streptomycin or the combination of isoniazid and ethambutol. For these reasons, there is a need to expand the use of the short sparse chemotherapy.



Coverage

The DOH Integrated Field Office (DIRFO) is the center for storage, resource planning, allocation and distribution of DOH-procured anti-TB drugs at the regional level. While some DIRFOs continue to distribute anti-TB drugs through provincial health offices, some have begun to ensure rational utilization by giving drugs directly to municipal or city health offices. Utilization of anti-TB drugs have been on-going in rural health units, barangay health stations and, a few NGO clinics and hospitals.

In the effort to provide health for more, the National Tuberculosis Control Program is expanding its service outlets to include retained hospitals of the Department of Health with demonstrated capability to adopt to the Hospital as Center of Wellness-NTP component and, more NGO clinics providing direct smear microscopy and case holding activities for TB patients.



Prioritization of Patients for Anti-TB Treatment

The control and prevention of tuberculosis is anchored on the cure of as many sputum smear positive cases as possible. This cuts tubercle transmission significantly, subsequent incidence of tuberculosis and, the mortality rate among infectious cases (smear positive) 50% of whom are found to have an average lifespan of 2 years if they remain untreated. These, thus, are the primary considerations for prioritization of treatment of TB patients.

Other considerations include: fatality rates among TB case classifications, potential to become as infectious case, number affected and their response to anti-TB drugs.

Thus, drugs and other material resources and manpower for treatment of tuberculosis cases under program conditions should be in the following order of priority:

First priority — smear positive cases, whether new, relapse or treatment failure cases. 

Second priority - smear negative but seriously ill cases, i.e., extra-pulmonary, pulmonary TB with extensive parenchymal involvement (on x-ray, far-advanced lesions and moderately advanced lesions with cavitations).

Third priority - smear negative, with X-ray findings consistent with TB but without extensive pulmonary lesions.

Fourth priority - children with primary TB, i.e., 0 to 9 year-old children with clinical signs and symptoms of tuberculosis who exhibit positive tuberculin or BCG accelerated reaction and radiologic findings suggestive of primary TB.

Last priority - chronic excretory of TB bacilli (treatment failures after a 5-drug regimen or chronic drug-resistant cases)



Anti-TB Drug Preparations

1. Type I Blister Pack refers to the 3-drug regimen consisting of daily dose of rifampicin 450 mg., 1 capsule pyrazinamide 500 mg., 2 tablets; and, INH 300 mg, 1 tablet, used during the first two months of intensive treatment phase and conveniently packed into 7 rows for each day of the week. One type I blister pack is, thus, good for the patient’s one-week drug supply.

2. Type II Blister Pack refers to the 2-drug regimen consisting of daily dose of rifampicin 450 mg., 1 capsule; and INH 300 mg, 1 tablet, used after the intensive phase (3rd to 6th months for smear positive cases) of treatment and, conveniently packed into 7 rows for each day of the week. One type II blister pack is also good for the patient's one—week drug supply during the maintenance phase.

3. Ethambutol tablets in 400 mg preparations is procured in bottles of 100 tablets. This is commonly used for the standard regimen at two tablets daily per patient for one year, in; combination with loose tablets of INH 300 mg.

4. INH tablets in 300 mg. preparations is procured in bottles of 100 tablets. This is commonly used for the standard regimen at one tablet daily per patient for one year, in combination with loose tablets of ethambutol 400 mg.

5. Streptomycin 1 gm vials is used as an alternative to ethambutol for the one—year standard regimen. The smear negative patient is made to consume an average of 100 vials of streptomycin within the ﬁrst 4 months of treatment in combination with INH 300 mg, after which only INH 300 mg. daily is given the rest of the year.

The use of the first ﬁve drug preparations enumerated above will be modified such that all treatment regimens will be short courses ranging from 4 to 8 months.
 
6. INH liquid in 100 mg./5 ml. preparation is procured in 120 ml. bottles and, is used for children below 10 years of age with primary infection who are malnourished and immunocompromised.

7. Rifampicin suspension in 100 mg./5ml. preparation is procured in 60 ml. or 120 ml. bottles and, is used for children below 10 years of age with primary infection who are malnourished and immunocompromised.



Recommended Use of DOH-procured Anti-TB Drug Preparation:

While NTP policy on diagnosis remains the same, there is an urgent need to change the treatment policies of the NTP foe the following classiﬁcation of patients who shall be made to undergo modiﬁed treatment protocol as follows:

<image>table_1.png</image>
<image>table_2.png</image>

Note: (1) All patients 10 years old and older are required to undergo sputum follow-up examination every two months upon initiation of treatment and at the end of treatment.

(2) Anytime a previously smear negative case turns out to be smear—positive with follow-up sputum examination, suspect drug-resistance. Use the 8-month regimen with initially 5 drugs (as in no. 2) for these types of patient.

(3) If a new smear positive continues to be smear positive after the ﬁfth month of treatment, use the same 8—month regimen.

(4) If a patient enrolled on the 8-month regimen continues to be positive on the fifth month, recommend a drug susceptibility study and prescribe drugs accordingly. If a drug susceptibility study is not feasible or not available, give INH 300 mg. tab OD for life.

Case Holding

Because current tuberculosis control programs need to be concerned not only of reduction of incidence but of the preservation of the efficacy of currently available anti-TB drugs, it is strongly recommended that case holding activities be implemented by all health personnel involved in TB case treatment.

A minimum set of case holding activities consisting of pre-treatment counselling, monitoring and management of drug side effects, sputum follow-up examination every two months and, immediate defaulter action should be planned for each patient. Take note that 90% of treatment failures are due to poor compliance to treatment and, only 10% are attributable to real drug resistance.

Since most hospitals have not yet developed the capability to do patient follow-up, it is recommended that anti-TB drugs only for intensive phase be distributed to these health facilities and that a referral system be worked at by designated NTP coordinators in the region and provinces between hospitals and RHUs.



Recording and Reporting

Recording and reporting for NTP shall follow the current Field Health Service Information System of DOH. Cohort analysis shall include only all smear positive cases.



Drug Procurement by Local Government Units

DOH local health board representatives and regional NTP coordinators are advised to recommend the above regimens and drug preparations to local health offices and their counterpart local executives. A local purchase of at least 10% of estimated annual needs is recommended to buffer any delays in deliveries of DOH-procured anti-TB drugs and cover the treatment of patients discovered beyond the expected number.
