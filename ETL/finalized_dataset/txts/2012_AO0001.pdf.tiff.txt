<subject>SUBJECT: New Rules and Regulations Governing the Licensure and Regulation of Dialysis Facilities in the Philippines</subject>

<body>
I. RATIONALE/ BACKGROUND

The Philippine Renal Disease Registry (PRDR) Annual Report for 2011 revealed that of the nine thousand seven hundred sixteen (9,716) patients that started dialysis in 2010, 9,133 (94%) patients were on hemodialysis (HD) and 583 (6%) patients on peritoneal dialysis (PD). There was an 8.9% increase in the number of patients on dialysis from 8,922 in 2009 to 9,716 in
2010. 

A listing of dialysis facilities in 2010 as reported by the Renal Disease Control Program (REDCOP) showed a total of 423 dialysis facilities nationwide of which 355 were HD and 68
were PD facilities. To obtain a snapshot of the level of compliance of Hemodialysis Clinics (HDC), the Department of Health (DOH) through the Bureau of Health Facilities and Services (BHFS) conducted a rapid assessment in March 2009 of selected HDC which revealed gaps instandards and requirements such as, but not limited to: a) personnel (inadequate staff); b)
equipment (use of refurbished machines with unknown manufacturing dates), supplies andmaterials (incomplete E-cart medicines, supplies and materials); and 0) physical facility(inadequate space for mobility of staff, patients and relatives, and inadequate hand washing areas) that will assure the safety of the foregoing facilities.

Current regulatory issuances on this matter need to be enhanced and updated in order to address the gaps that were noted during the survey. One of these is entitled Administrative
Order (AO) No. 163 s. 2004 “Revised Rules and Regulations Governing the Licensure and Regulation of Dialysis Clinics in the Philippines” and A0. No. 2006 —— 0037, an Amendment of
the same. This Order rescinds such issuance in line with the objective of health regulatory reforms to ensure access to safe, quality and affordable health facilities and dialysis services.

II. OBJECTIVE

This Order is promulgated to prescribe a revised minimum standard for HDC to ensure safe
and effective HD treatments.


III. SCOPE

This Order shall apply to all government and private HDC in the Philippines. In cases where PD is also performed in an HDC, DOH through BHFS shall advocate PhilHealth accreditation standards and requirements on PD.

The Renal Disease Control Program addresses all levels of renal disease prevention (health promotion, primary, secondary, tertiary prevention including prevention of death of ESRD patients through transplantation and organ donation) by conceptualizing planning, implementing projects and activities on research, training, advocacy, service and quality assurance.

25. Refurbished HD Machine — a pre-owned HD machine sent back to the supplier with capability to recondition and calibrate the unit to speciﬁcations that will ensure
accuracy and safety. 

26. Reverse Osmosis (RO) a ﬁltration method that removes many types of large molecules and ions from solutions by applying pressure to the solution when it is on one side of a selective membrane. The result is that the solute is retained on the pressurized side of the membrane and the pure solvent is allowed to pass to the other side. It represents the ultimate in ultra-ﬁltration.
