I. RATIONALE/BACKGROUN6D 

Inﬂuenza is a recurring respiratory condition recognized as occurring particularly during the winter months in temperate countries where inﬂuenza Was first observed. Inﬂuenza has high morbidity rates for children and for adults about 60 years old, patients with chronic illness and pregnant women. The inﬂuenza virus A that affects humans mutates easily, often causing new antigenic variants, and the occurrence of inﬂuenza pandemic. The 1957—1958 Asian inﬂuenza was caused Inﬂuenza A/HZNZ, while the Hong Kong ﬂu which took place in 1968-1969, resulting in nearly one million death, was caused by Inﬂuenza A/H3N2. The SARS outbreak in 2004 also demonstrated the speed by which new and emerging infections may be transmitted. The occurrence of a potential inﬂuenza pandemic is unpredictable, imminent and possibly inevitable. In 2009 the world, experienced the 2009 Inﬂuenza A/HlNl pandemic resulting in 18,000 deaths according to the World Health Organization (WHO). 

The Philippines Disease Integrated Surveillance and Response (PIDSR) is a multifaceted public health disease surveillance system that provides public health officials the capabilities to monitor the occurrence and spread of diseases. The goal of the PIDSR is to strengthen surveillance and response capabilities at each level of the health system by building local capacities and leveraging strengths and areas of expertise through partnership and coordination. The vision of PIDSR is to improve the availability and use of surveillance and laboratory data so that public health managers and decision makers can plan for and carry out more timely detection and response to the leading causes of illness, death and disability. Information from the PIDSR is expected to be used for the following purposes: 

-Facilitate collecting, managing, analyzing, interpreting, and disseminating health related data for diseases designated as nationally notifiable, 
-Develop and maintain national standards, such as consistent case deﬁnitions for nationally notiﬁable diseases) applicable across all the provinces and cities, 
-Maintain the official national notifiable diseases statistics
-Provide detailed data to control programs to facilitate the identification of speciﬁc disease trends; and 
-Work with cities and provinces and partners to implement and assess prevention and control programs. 


Influenza-Like-Illness (ILI) is among the notiﬁable diseases under the PIDSR. In addition to obtaining epidemiologic information, it also collects data on whether laboratory confirmation was done of the ILI case either through virus isolation or polymerase chain reaction (PCR). It also classiﬁed ILI cases as either suspect or laboratory conﬁrmed, thereby highlighting the role of laboratory procedures as necessary in the classification of ILI cases. 

The Global Inﬂuenza Surveillance and Response System (GISRS)1, previously known as the Global Inﬂuenza Surveillance Network (GISN), has set up a network for the conduct of inﬂuenza virological surveillance since 1948. An integral part of GISRS activities is the laboratory diagnosis and virological surveillance of circulating inﬂuenza viruses — key elements in both inﬂuenza vaccine virus selection and the early detection of emerging viruses with pandemic potential. The primary aims of the system have been threefold: to monitor changes in antigenicity of inﬂuenza viruses; to guide the selection of strains for the annual inﬂuenza vaccine; and to provide virus samples for use in vaccine production. The GISRS consists of over 130 National Inﬂuenza Centres (NICs) around the world that collect and test clinical specimens, submitting a sample of these to WHO Collaborating Centres (WHO CC) and Essential Regulatory Laboratories for further characterization?” 3 In effect that GISRS has contributed signiﬁcantly to the protection of global public health by updating seasonal inﬂuenza vaccine compositions and by functioning as a global alert mechanism for the emergence of inﬂuenza viruses with pandemic potential. 

The Research Institute for Tropical Medicine participated in the GISN as the country’s sole National Inﬂuenza Center in 2005. The WHO recognized the RITM insofar as inﬂuenza surveillance information is concerned and has participated in all the .NIC related activities as called for by both the WHO and the US-CDC. This was further facilitated by a grant provided by the US—Centers for Disease Prevention and Control (CDC) that RITM and the Department of Health’s National Epidemiology Center (NBC) to develop a national inﬂuenza surveillance for the country from 2005 to 2010. Because of an oversight, the RITM was not designated the country’s NIC by its national authorities, in this case, the Department I of Health, although it has functioned as such for nearly a decade now. It is about time for i the RITM to be ofﬁcially designated as the Philippines’ National Inﬂuenza Center.

The guidelines and standards prescribed thereto shall be applied to, and beneﬁt, the entire health sector, with the Dept. of Health as the lead agency. 


V. DEFINITION OF TERMS 

Disease surveillance 

The systematic, continuing assessment of the health of a community, based on the collection, interpretation and use of health data. Surveillance provides information necessary for public health decision-making. 


Inﬂuenza epidemic 
An outbreak of inﬂuenza caused by inﬂuenza A or B viruses that have undergone antigenic drift. The terms “inﬂuenza epidemic” and “inﬂuenza outbrea ” have the same meaning, and may occur locally or in many parts of the world during the same season.


Inﬂuenza pandemic 

By convention, worldwide outbreaks of inﬂuenza caused by inﬂuenza A viruses that have undergone antigenic shift. A pandemic is a global disease outbreak. A ﬂu pandemic occurs when a new inﬂuenza virus emerges for which people have little or no immunity and for which there is no vaccine. The disease spreads easily person-to-person, causes serious illness, and can sweep across the country and around the world in very short time. 

Inﬂuenza Inter-Pandemic Period 

The inﬂuenza inter-pandemic period has two phases. In Phase 1 no new inﬂuenza virus subtypes have been detected in humans; the inﬂuenza virus subtype that has caused human infection may be present in animals, but the risk of human infection or disease is considered to be low. In Phase 2, although no new inﬂuenza virus subtypes have been detected in humans, there is a circulating animal inﬂuenza virus subtype posing a substantial risk of human disease. 
National Inﬂuenza Centers 

Are institutions recognized by the World Health Organization to perform inﬂuenza virological surveillance. These NICs collect specimens in their country, perform primary virus isolation and preliminary antigenic characterization. They also ship newly isolated strains to WHO Collaborating Center for high level antigenic and genetic analysis, the result of which forms the basis for WHO recommendations on the composition of inﬂuenza vaccine for the Northern and Southern Hemisphere each year. 

Inﬂuenza Virological surveillance 

The inﬂuenza inter-pandemic period has two phases. In Phase 1 no new inﬂuenza virus subtypes have been detected in humans; the inﬂuenza virus subtype that has caused human infection may be present in animals, but the risk of human infection or disease is considered to be low. In Phase 2, although no new inﬂuenza virus subtypes have been detected in humans, there is a circulating animal inﬂuenza virus subtype posing a substantial risk of human disease. 

Polymerase Chain Reaction

A powerful, molecular technique for the identiﬁcation of inﬂuenza virus genomes even when they are present at very low levels. 

The ongoing and systematic collection and analysis of inﬂuenza viruses in order to monitor their characteristics. 


VI. GENERAL PROVISIONS 

The International Health Regulations of 2005 aims to protect countries against international disease spread while avoiding unnecessary interference with global travel and trade. Succeeding resolutions of the World Health Assembly from 2005 to 2011, highlighted the urgency and the signiﬁcance of developing national laboratory and inﬂuenza surveillance capacity including the mobilization of ﬁnancial support for strengthening and sustaining this laboratory capacity. As a member state of the World Health Assembly, the Philippines has the obligation to prevent and control the spread of disease inside and outside its borders, 

specially for diseases like inﬂuenza which is both an emerging and re-ernerging disease. 

In recognition of this, the Department of Health hereby orders that the Research Institute for Tropical Medicine is the country’s National Inﬂuenza Center and shall receive 

the technical, logistic and ﬁnancial support to perform its functions. 

VII. GUIDELINES FOR THE OPERATIONS OF THE PNIC 

 <image>figure_1.png</image>

 
Disease Prevention and Control Bureau — Infectious Diseases for Prevention and Control Division (DPCB-IDPCD). This ofﬁce is primarily responsible for the development and implementation of the integrated national preparedness and response plan, to provide updates, technical advice and recommendations on the recognition, prevention and control of diseases and the organization of the DOH Management Committee for the Prevention and Control of Emerging and Re-emerging Infectious Diseases, to provide logistical support for surveillance and laboratory activities. EB shall share with the DPCB the report on inﬂuenza laboratory conﬁrmed cases. 

Epidemiology Bureau (EB). This ofﬁce is primarily responsible for collection of information on notifiable diseases through the PIDSR and detecting or conﬁrming disease outbreaks. Through its sentinel sites, it will refer ILI from its sentinel sites to the PNIC for inﬂuenza laboratory testing. Since ILI is among the notiﬁable diseases for which information is required to classify an ILI case as suspected or laboratory conﬁrmed, the PNIC will report to the EB all the laboratory results of ILI cases from whom nasal swabs are obtained. It is also responsible for providing logistical support for surveillance activities which includes laboratory conﬁrmation. 

Philippine National Inﬂuenza Center (PNIC). Within the RITM, the PNIC is composed of three departments: Virology, Molecular Biology and Epidemiology and Biostatistics. The functions of these departments are as follows: 

Department of Virology (DV). This department is responsible for the detection of inﬂuenza and other viruses using Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) and viral isolation techniques. This will require the laboratory to maintain several cell lines to allow for the detection of a variety of respiratory pathogens, in addition to inﬂuenza. The DV is also responsible for the typing, subtyping and further determining the antigenic characteristics of inﬂuenza viral isolates using the haemagglutination inhibition (HA1) test. In instances when isolates need conﬁrmation or are unsubtypable, the department will send these isolates to a WHO Collaborating Center. The department is also responsible for the training of health workers in the collection, storage and transport of specimen in different sentinel sites. 

Molecular Biology Department (MBL). This department is responsible for the application of molecular techniques to directly detect inﬂuenza A or B genetic material in respiratory samples or viral cultures. The employment of these techniques can greatly facilitate the identiﬁcation of human inﬂuenza A subtypes including those with the potential to cause a pandemic and thus expedite the investigation of outbreaks of respiratory illness. It is the primary department responsible for processing of specimen during inﬂuenza pandemic and the training of sub—national laboratories staff in the use of conventional and real-time PCR for inﬂuenza detection. 

Department of Epidemiology and Biostatisties (DEBS). This department is responsible for the data management of the data collected and generated by the PNIC. It is also responsible for the provision of information on inﬂuenza activity in the country to the Epidemiology Bureau (EB) of the Department of Health and World Health Organization through the FLUNET. 

Ofﬁce of the Director of the RITM is at at the same time the Director of the PNIC, who has administrative responsibilities over the departments under the NIC. Its operations are overseen by the Center Management Team (CMT) which is composed of the departents under the PNIC, including the Institute’s Chief Administrative Ofﬁcer and head of the Accounting Departments.
