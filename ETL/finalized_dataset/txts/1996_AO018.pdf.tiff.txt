<subject>SUBJECT: Revised Guidelines on the Distribution and Utilization of the Toyota Hilux Utility Vehicles for the Malaria Control Program (MCP)</subject>

<body>
 
The Philippines Health Development Project (PHDP), a 5—year project of the Department of Health (DOH) from 1990-1994, has procured utility vehicles to support and facilitate the activities of the MCP in all malaria-endemic regions. In order to  properly distribute these vehicles, the Malaria Control Service (MCS) prepared the allocation list in accordance with its criteria on ensuring proper and maximum utilization. The distribution was completed just before the devolution of health services into the Local Government Units (LGUs) in 1992.

Some Regional Field Ofﬁces (RFOs) and Provincial Health Ofﬁces (PHOs), however, were unable to conform with the Distribution Guidelines. This created certain conﬂicts in the use of these vehicles. At some instance, these vehicles could not be available when the MCP need them most in order to carry out field operations, particularly during epidemics. In fact, this issue has been brought out during the November MCS Consultative Meeting wherein the participants recommended the revision of the previous guidelines.

To rectify this problem and implement the MCP effectively, the following guidelines need to be observed:

1. The Regional Director shall have the authority over the said vehicles, but the ultimate end users shall be the Regional Malaria Coordinator (RMC), the Provincial or City Malaria Coordinator (PMC/CMC) or the Provincial Malaria Operations Ofﬁcer (PMO) as the corresponding Memorandum Receipt (MR) shall be issued to him; all Memorandum Receipt, which had been previously issued to other personnel, should now be transferred to the RMC/PMC/PMO concerned.

2. Except during calamities and/or disasters, priority for use shall be for Malaria Control activities.

3. The RMC/PMC/PMO concerned shall ensure the safety repair and maintenance of the vehicle, the expenses of which shall be borne by the Regional Health Office concerned.

4. All utility vehicles were initially insured and registered by the Central Office. The renewal and succeeding payments shall he the responsibility of the RFO concerned.

5. The Malaria Control Service shall see to it that the above-guideiines are complied with.

6. Attached is the Allocation List.

Any Administrative Issuance issued, which is inconsistent with these guidelines, is hereby revoked.


For compliance.
