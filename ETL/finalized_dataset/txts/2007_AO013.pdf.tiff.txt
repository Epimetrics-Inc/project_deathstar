<subject>SUBJECT: Guidelines on the Implementation of the Online Job Posting System for Human Resources for Health (e-Jobs for Health)</subject>

<body>
I. BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE

Section 1 of Republic Act No. 7041, "An Act Requiring Regular Publication of Existing Vacant Positions in Government Offices, Appropriating Funds Thereof, and For Other Purposes", states that, "It shall be the policy of the Government to promote efficiency in the allocation of personnel in the civil service, as well as transparency and equal opportunities in the recruitment and hiring of new personnel."

In addition, Section III item 1 of Administrative Order No. 87-B s. 2002, "Adoption of the Merit Promotion Plan for the Department of Health and all its Offices, Bureaus and Hospitals", states that, "Vacant positions marked for filling shall be published in accordance with Republic Act No. 7041. The published vacant positions shall also be posted in at least three (3) conspicuous places in the agency for at least ten (10) calendar days. Other appropriate modes of publication shall be considered."

The existing modes of publication of job vacancies in DOH include posting in newspapers, in conspicuous places and in the DOH website. These publications are limited to vacancies within the DOH System (Central Offices, Centers for Health Development, Retained Hospitals and Attached Agencies) and do not include those in the other sectors in health such as other government agencies, local government units and private facilities. Because of this existing system of posting job vacancies, Human Resources for Health (HRH) within and outside DOH have limited access to vacancies in the whole health sector.

The Online Job Posting System (OJPS) has been developed in order to address the problem of limited opportunities for HRH to find suitable jobs. Through the OJPS, vacancies available in the health sector nationwide can be made available and can reach a wide range of potential applicants. The OJPS is in consonance with the National Objectives for Health (NOH) 2005-2010 as shown by the HRH framework (Annex A) and the Fourmula One for Health (F1). F1 is the current implementation framework for health sector reforms. One of its four components is service delivery. Under this component are three strategies, one of which is "ensuring availability of providers of basic and essential health services in localities." HRH is one, if not the most important, health service resource that has to be provided for effective and efficient health service delivery. Specifically, OJPS or also called E-jobs for Health is an innovative system that will enhance existing service delivery system. It can facilitate recruitment and placement of HRH where they are needed and may address the problem of inequitable distribution of HRH.

II. OBJECTIVES
