I. RATIONALE 

Violence and injuries are threat to every country in the world. Worldwide, more than ﬁve million people (15-44 years old) die each year as a result of some forms of injury and many more remain disabled for life. Given current trends, the global burden of violence and injuries is . expected to rise considerably during the coming decades, particularly in low-income and middle- income countries (WHO, 2006). 

According to the World Health Report in 2000, the leading causes of deaths for persons aged 15-29 included road traffic injuries, self-indicted injuries, interpersonal violence, war injuries, drowning, poisoning, and injuries resulting from ﬁre. Injuries are regarded as the third main cauSe of overall mortality in the world that lead to an immense impact on the families and communities affected (WHO, 2010). 

In the Philippines, mortality due to injuries per 100,000 population (assaults, road traffic injuries, drowning, and fall) has been increasing from 1975 up to 2002 (DOH, 2007). In 2009, accidents were recorded as the 6th leading cause of mortality among Filipinos affecting more males than females (29,288 vs. 6,703 deaths) [DOH, 2011]. Topping the list of external causes of injuries was transport/vehicular crash followed by mauling, fall and contact with sharp objects (DOH, 2013). 

Injuries also account for a significant amount of disability and economic loss. Much of the burden of injuries could be decreased by improvements in care of the injured particularly the provision of prompt prehospital care. However, most countries in the world do not have access to prehospital care. Only a few victims receive treatment on-scene and fewer are transported to the hospital through an ambulance. Thus, many victims pointlessly die at the scene or during the ﬁrst few hours following the injury (WHO, 2005). Prehospital emergency medical service (EMS) system forms a vital part of the public health care system that will effectively address the magnitude of day—to-day emergencies. 

At present, there is no existing legal mandate in the Philippines for the development of a prehospital EMS system. Some-local government units in the country, especially urban centers, prompted the establishment of an EMS system through directives and ordinances. However, emergence of a standardized / Uniﬁed pre-hospital EMS system at the national and local level is desired. 

Thus, as an integral part of the Revised National Policy on Violence and Injury Prevention (AO 2014-0002), there is a need to establish a prehospital EMS system at the national and local level in order to prevent deaths due to injuries and to minimize or mitigate occurrence of disabilities. 

II. OBJECTIVES 

A. General Objective: Institutionalize a comprehensive, accessible and integrated system of prehospital emergency medical services from the scene of incident to the appropriate health care facility or hospital at the national and local level. 

B. Speciﬁc Objectives: 

1. Develop, implement, monitor and evaluate evidence-based and customized standards and guidelines for best practices in prehospital emergency medical services; 

2. Enhance capacity of Regional Ofﬁces (ROS), Local Government Units (LGUs), and other stakeholders as well as strengthen collaboration with them towards establishing an efﬁcient and sustainable prehospital EMS system; and 

3. Ensure full operationalization and implementation of the prehospital EMS system from the national level down to the grassroots level. 

III. SCOPE 

This issuance shall apply to all concerned units both in the government and private sectors. In the government sector, this will apply to DOH bureaus, national centers, ROS, LGUS, health care facilities and hospitals, andother national government agencies. 

IV. DEFINITION OF TERMS For purposes of this issuance, the following terms shall be deﬁned as follows: 

A. Ambulance — refers to the mode of vehicular transportation used to carry and transfer emergency service equipment, emergency service providers, and patient/s requiring urgent or emergency care. Vehicles may refer to motorboats, helicopters, jets, motorcycles, or vans. Except for the motorcycle, ambulance is intended to be crewed by a minimum of two appropriately trained staff for the provision of care and transport of at least one stretchered patient. 

B. Basic Life Support (BLS) —— constellation of emergency procedures needed to ensure a person’s immediate survival including cardio-pulmonary resuscitation, control bleeding, and treatment of shock and poisoning, stabilization of injuries, and basic ﬁrst aid. (WHO-Regional Ofﬁce for Europe, 2005) 

C. Emergency Medical Service (EMS) Personnel — Trained and certified personnel engaged in the provision of emergency medical services during emergencies. Responders may either be health professionals or non-health professionals. 

D. Emergency Medical Service (EMS) System — arrangement of personnel, facilities, and equipment for the effective and coordinated delivery of EMS required in the prevention and management of incidents which occur either as a result of a medical emergency or of an accident. It refers to the broad range of emergency care from prehospital care to transport in an intensive care setting. (WHO-Regional Office for Europe, 2005) 

E. Emergency Medical Technician (EM?) / Paramedic — a trained and certiﬁed healthcare provider specializing in basic or advanced prehospital emergency medical services. 

F. Emergency Number — a standard telephone and/or cellular phone number that directly connect to the emergency dispatch central coordinating ofﬁce for callers to access needed ﬁre, police, and/or health emergency services. 

G. First Aid — provision of initial care for an illness or injury. 

H. First Responder — any bystander or witness who can render BLS, regardless of the level of his/her training. 

I. Injury — a bodily lesion at the organic level, resulting from acute exposure of energy (mechanical, thermal, electrical, chemical, or radiant) in amounts that exceed the threshold of physiological tolerance. In some cases, injuries, such as drowning and strangulation, result from insufficiency of vital life-sustaining element, such as oxygen. (WHO, 2002) 

J. Prehospital Emergency Medical Services — the range of services delivered to emergency patients prior to hospital transport. These services include, and may not be limited to, emergency dispatch; emergency response and care; emergency transport; and inter-facility referral and transport. 

V. GENERAL GUIDELINES A. Program Components 

1. Policy, Standards and Regulation The DOH shall ensure the establishment of a Uniﬁed / standardized EMS system at the national and local level in coordination with the local government unit and local agencies. 


2. Service Delivery 

a. In recognition of the importance of safety and emergency services, the DOH shall establish a comprehensive and integrated system to ensure equitable and accessible prehospital emergency medical services. 

b. Networking and partnership with other sectors and stakeholders involved in the provision of prehospital emergency medical services shall be strengthened to ensure synergies and intersectoral coordination. 

3. Health Financing 

The DOH shall ensure ﬁnancial protection and sustained funding for prehospital emergency medical services especially for the most vulnerable and marginalized sectors through the development of PhilHealth beneﬁt packages. 

4. Human Resources for Health 

The DOH shall capacitate prehospital EMS providers with knowledge and skills at par with the standards and shall provide health facilities / institutions and partners / stakeholders with the necessities. 

5. Health Information 

a. Strengthen surveillance and data base system to improve the quality of data collected which shall be utilized for the development of interventions and decision-making process, sound plans and strategies, relevant policies, program development and research. 

b. Monitoring and evaluation mechanism shall be developed to ensure implementation, management and provision of standardized prehospital EMS system nationwide. 

6. Advocacy 

a. The DOH shall advocate for relevant policy and legislation to strengthen the pre- hospital EMS at the national and local levels. 

b. The DOH shall lead in the awareness campaign and other initiatives in promoting prehospital emergency medical services. 

B. Action Framework for Prehospital Emergency Medical Services System 

The framework below revolves around these four components of prehospital emergency medical service system: 

A. Emergency Dispatch: involves the immediate identification and prioritizing of emergency situations, the timely dispatch of the most appropriate resources and full endorsement to the receiving hospital. Dispatch encompasses all aspects of communication including request processing, coordination and support, and documentation and monitoring. 

B. Emergency Response and Care: involves arrival of resources at the scene and the timely initiation of appropriate interventions. 

C. Emergency Transport: involves transporting the patient to the most appropriate facility and continued provision of care en route. 

D. Inter-Facility Referral and Transport: involves the transport of patient with medical escorts, if necessary, from one facility to another, as the patient requires services that are not available in the referring facility. 

Furthermore, other components below are equally important in the provision of such services: 

A. Existing Healthcare Delivery Systems: involves the various levels of health units, e.g. barangay health stations, rural health units, free standing clinics, etc., and referral units, i.e. inter-local health zones; 

B. Available Groups of Service Providers and Stakeholders which begins with the organizational structure and dynamics of the Program Management Committee which coordinates the strategies and implementation of the National Policyon Violence and Injury Prevention, and shall later include healthcare professionals, accredited EMT / paramedics, barangay health workers, and volunteer organizations; 

C. Support Facilities and Systems refer to accessible communication and transport facilities; 

D. Legal Framework: deﬁnes the contractual liabilities of all stakeholders (individuals, agencies, and hospitals) as deﬁned in appropriate policy mechanisms and instruments. It also involves developing and operationalizing procedures and guidelines for policy implementation; and 

E. Governance: system management and supervision at the national (or local) level by a council/network/coalition, which may include representation from the government and other stakeholders under the chairmanship of an appropriate authority. It will coordinate the implementation of the EMS system within the cOuntry (or province or city) through standardization, regulation, accreditation, policy making, monitoring and evaluation, technical and capability building, resource sharing and management, and steering inter- sectoral coordination. Also, it will manage and supervise at the local level by the local chief executive through a fitting office that will overlook functioning of the EMS system at the grassroots level.
