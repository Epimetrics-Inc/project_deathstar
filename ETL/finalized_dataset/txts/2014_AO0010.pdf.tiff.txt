<subject>SUBJECT: Rescission of the Administrative Order No. 138 s. 2004 dated February 23,2004 entitled “Guidelines for the Implementation of the Simplified Supplier Registration System (SSRS)” and Administrative Order No. 180 s 2004 dated December 7,2004 entitled “Additional Guidelines for the Simplified Supplier Registration System” </subject>
<body>
 

The primarily concept of the Simplified Suppliers Registration System (SSRS), implemented in 2004, is to reduce the documentary requirements submitted by the prospective bidders during the Submission and Opening of Bids. However, securing a SSRS Certificate IS not a mandatory requirement in participating in the biddings of the Department of Health (DOH). With the implementation of the Revised Implementing Rules and Regulations of Republic Act 9184, the eligibility requirements which a bidder have to submit were reduced. Since then, it has been observed that majority of the bidders are no longer using the SSRS Certificate while other bidders who submit the SSRS Certificate still submit the documents included in the certificate. ” 

In view of the foregoing, Administrative Order No. 138 s. 2004 dated February 23, 2004 entitled i‘Guidelines for the Implementation of the Simplified Supplier Registration System (SSRS)” and Administrative Order No. 1.80. s. 2004 dated December 7, 2004 entitled “Additional Guidelines for the Simplified Supplier RegiStration System” is hereby rescinded. 


All individuals and/or entities holding existing and valid SSRS Certificate shall not be required to submit documents that are reﬂeCted in the certificate until the expiration of the cited certificate. 

This Order shall take effect immediately.
