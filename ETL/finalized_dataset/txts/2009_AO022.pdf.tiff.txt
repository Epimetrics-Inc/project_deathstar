<subject>SUBJECT: Guidelines on the Determination of Funds for Transfer to Local Government Units Year 2010</subject>


<body>
I. RATIONALE 

The Department of Health is committed to achieve the Health Sector goals through the implementation of Health Sector Reforms. These goals are reﬂected in the National Objectives for Health (NOH) and the Medium Term Philippine Development Plan and they include the Millennium Development Goals which are international commitments of the country. Local Government Units (LGUs) are the main partners of DOH in achieving these goals and local health systems must be in place to bring this about. However, the attainment of health system goals within a devolved system is faced with the following challenges which may slow down the implementation of health reforms: 

1. Differences in health priorities between DOH and LGUs and among LGUs; 

2. LGUs may lack the necessary skills and resources; 

3. The catchment area of health services does not necessarily correspond to administrative boundaries which may not give enough incentives for LGUs to fully support health programs; 

4. Certain technical resources may not be readily accessible to LGUs; and 

5. Weaknesses in governance mechanisms may lead to inefficient and inequitable health service delivery. 

The DOH is mandated to assist local government units (LGUs) in effectively implementing programs, projects and activities that promote the health and well being of every Filipino. In performing this mandate, the DOH must address Operational issues by systematizing the sub—allotment/transfer of resources from the DOH Central Office to the Centers for Health Development (CHDs) and to Local Government Units (LGUs). These sub-allotments/transfers need to be rationalized by (1) matching needs of CHDs and LGUs with available resources in the DOH Central Ofﬁce, (2) improving coordination between the Central Office and CHDs for better implementation of programs in the ﬁeld, and (3) establishing a reporting system that links activities with desired results and outcomes. 

Likewise it has become imperative that DOH resources shall be primarily used to leverage LGU performance based on the Province-wide Investment Plan for Health (PIPH) and as measured by the LGU Scorecard. 

II. OBJECTIVE 

1. Provide technical and administrative basis for the determination of the amounts from the DOH Budget as reﬂected in the CY2010 General Appropriations Act (GAA) for sub—allotment to CHDs and for transfer to LGUs for the implementation of programs and projects 

2. Describe the principles governing how such funds shall be released and utilized 

III. SCOPE AND COVERAGE 

1. This Department Order shall cover all Maintenance and Other Operating Expenses (MOOE) and Capital Outlay (CO) that shall be sub-alloted and transferred from programs and projects as speciﬁed herein. 

2. This Order shall apply to all units in Central Ofﬁce sub-allotting/transferring such resources and to all recipient CHDS and LGUs. 

IV. GENERAL GUIDELINES 

1. The Province-wide Investment Plan for Health (PIPH) and its Annual Operational Plan (AOP) shall be the basis for sub-allotment/transfer to CHDS and LGUs. The MOA covering the PIPH and its AOP signed by the Secretary of Health and the Governor for the past and current year shall be the legal basis for all transfers of funds from the DOH to the LGU. No other MOA shall be effected to implement speciﬁc transfers except for LGUs that have yet to develop their PIPH. In transition, transfers to LGUs without PIPH shall be covered by a separate MOA entered into between the Secretary of Health and the Governor or City Mayor. 

2. The CHDS shall be the focal units in facilitating and monitoringcash transfers and steering the LGUs to attain desired health system goals. They shall ensure that activities supported by fund transfers from the Central Ofﬁce are reﬂected in the DOH counterpart column of the AOP and shall have corresponding local counterpart. 

3. Funds sub-allotted to CHDs shall cover expenses for region-wide activities. 

Provinces with MOAs with the DOH shall indicate in the Annual Budget for health a speciﬁc budget line item — Health Systems Development Program (HSDP). The DOH shall effect cash transfers to the account where funds for the HSDP are maintained. 

In the case of the following 10 provinces where a grant from the European Commission is provided as budget support, the HSDP funds are accounted for in a subsidiary ledger in the general fund: Pangasinan, Mountain Province, Oriental Mindoro, Capiz, Negros Oriental, Biliran, Eastern Samar, North Cotabato, South Cotabato, and Agusan del Sur. For these provinces, therefore, the DOH shall effect cash transfers to the general fund, recorded in the subsidiary ledger for the HSDP, wherein the EC grant is also accounted for. 

For the other Provinces, a special trust account shall be maintained for the HSDP, unless otherwise speciﬁed in the MOA or in the Service Level Agreement. 

Cash transfers to LGUs shall be made to support: (1) current performance levels and (2) target performance increases as stated in the AOP. This fund shall not replace the provincial and municipal investment investments committed in the AOP. 

4. For the funds transferred to ARMM, the DOH-Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao (DOH- ARMM) may retain a maximum of 30 percent thereof to cover expenses incurred for the region- wide implementation of programs in the region. 

V. SPECIFIC GUIDELINES 

1. The budget line items from which funds to leverage local performance are identiﬁed. This includes, but are not limited to, the following: 

a. Health System Development Program including Policy Support & 

b. Elimination of diseases as public health threat such as malaria, schistosomiasis, leprosy and ﬁlariasis 

c. TB Control 

d. Family Health including Family Planning 

e. Health Facilities Enhancement Program 

f. Provision for Potable Water Supply 

Funds obtained from the above—mentioned budget line items shall be utilized to leverage LGU performance in improving access to essential health care services and initiatives such as maternal, newborn, child health care and nutrition, tuberculosis control, quality and affordable medicines especially for the poor. 

2. The budget that shall be sub-allotted to CHDS and transferred to LGUs will be determined by the different units in charge of priority budget line items according to the following procedures: 

a. Compute for the total MOOE needed to maintain current operational level of the unit managing the budget line item by adding 10% to previous year s (CY2009) obligations for utilities and monitoring and evaluation activities, 

b. Based on the CY2010 Operational Plan of the budget line items, compute for the total MOOE needed for the development of health policies and for the MOOE needed for commodities; 

c. Based on the CY2010 Operational Plan for budget line items, compute for MOOE needed to augment funds of CHDS in order to implement priority activities in the region; 

d. The MOOE for leveraging LGU performance is equal to the total MOOE minus the sum of MOOE for operational expenses, policy development, commodities and augmentation of CHDS Operational funds; 

e. All Capital Outlay (CO) funds shall be allocated to LGU-owned health facilities. 

3. Provincial Ceilings shall be determined by the different units in charge of priority budget line items from the funds to leverage LGU performance. 

Provincial budget ceilings shall be set for the above-mentioned budget line items using indicators such as target population, poverty, and bed to population ratio as weights. Budget ceilings referred under this section shall pertain to MOOE for leveraging LGU performance. 

Determination of provincial budget ceilings for MOOE to leverage LGU performance will be as follows: 

a. Health System Development Program including Policy Support. Funds to leverage LGU performance for health system development shall determine ceilings by: 
i. Funds for ﬁrst 16 provinces are determined based on the allocation as agreed under the Health Sector Policy Support Project; 
ii. Provincial ceilings for the rest of the LGUs in the country are determined by: 
1. Deducting the total amount allocated for ﬁrst 16 provinces ﬁ‘om the total amount to leverage LGU performance 
2. Estimating the population of the poor in the LGU by multiplying population with the poverty rate 
3. Multiplying the proportion of the poor in the LGU with the amount for leveraging LGU performance 
iii. Provincial ceiling shall consist of a ﬁxed tranche and a variable tranche. The ﬁxed tranche shall be 75% of the total provincial ceiling to be allocated for operations. The variable tranche shall be 25% of the provincial ceiling to be allocated based on the performance pursuant to the LGU Scorecard result for the previous year. 

b. Elimination of diseases as public health threat such as malaria, schistosomiasis, leprosy and filariasis Provincial ceilings will be used to eliminate malaria, schistosomiasis, leprosy and ﬁlariasis and are determined according to the following procedures: 

i. Using Malaria Prevalence as proxy indicator to determine budget ceilings, identify the number of people affected by malaria 1n each province and region using the latest Field Health Service Information System (F HSIS) as reference. 

ii. Determine the proportion of the population affected by malaria in the region by dividing the affected population in the region with the affected population nationwide. 

iii. Assign a baseline amount to all the regions, including non-endemic areas, necessary to conduct basic advocacy and training activities. 

iv. Deduct the total amount for baseline support to the regions from the total funds to leverage performance to get the remaining amount to be transferred 

v. Multiply the remaining amount to be transferred with the proportion of population affected with malaria in the region to get the regional ceiling 

vi. Allocate the regional ceiling to provinces and independent cities within the region by multiplying the proportion of the population affected by malaria in the province with the regional ceiling. 

c. TBControl. Considering the available resources to leverage LGU performance, only provinces that have low TB cure rate (CR) and low TB case detection rate (CDR) based from the 2007 NTP Proﬁle, will receive funds to leverage LGU performance. Provincial allocations are determined as follows: 

i. Identify provinces with low CR, below 85%, and low CDR, below 70%. 

ii. Estimate the number of population affected by TB in the province by multiplying the projected population for 2010 with the TB prevalence rate. 

iii. Multiply the proportion of TB affected population in the province with the available funds for leveraging LGU performance to determine the provincial ceiling. 

iv. Aggregate provincial ceilings per region to determine amounts for sub-allotment to CHDs 

d. Family Health including Family Planning. The estimated number of married women of reproductive age (MWRA) who are poor are the basis in determining the regional and provincial ceilings for MOOE funds from Family Health and Primary Health Care. The regional and provincial ceilings are determined according to this procedure: 

i. The estimated number of women of reproductive age of each region is multiplied by each region’s corresponding poverty rate based from the latest F IES. 

ii. Allocate at least PhP 20,000,000 to all regions as the total indicative aggregate budget which their LGUs will receive as grants that will allow them to implement the policy on maternal, neonatal, child health and nutrition speciﬁcally to perform the minimum and basic activities for the program which may include, among others, training for BEmONC and Women’s Health Team, procurement of emergency drugs for BEmONC, monitoring and reporting maternal deaths, advocacy and the like. 

iii. Distribute the remaining amount by regions by multiplying the proportion of poor MWRA in the region with the remaining amount after deducting the total baseline support to LGUs. 

iv. Allocate the regional amount to provinces within the region by multiplying the proportion of poor MWRA with the regional ceiling. 

Allocation for capital outlay (CO) funds for facilities providing Basic Emergency Maternal Obstetric and Newborn Care (BEmONC) will follow these procedures: 

i. Determine regional ceilings by: 

1. Estimate the number of poor MWRA in the region; 

2. Get the proportion of MWRA in the region by dividing MWRA ofthe region with the national MWRA; 

3. Multiply the proportion of MWRA in the region with the total amount for CO. 

ii. Compute for the provincial ceilings based on the following: 

1. Estimating the number of poor MWRA in the province and getting the proportion of MWRA in the province; 

2. Multiply the proportion of MWRA in the province with the regional ceiling. 

iii. Allocate the provincial ceilings to health facilities in the province by following these rules: 

1. Facilities receiving assistance from any foreign-assisted project such as Spanish Grant, Mindanao Health Sector Development Program and the like shall not receive any additional assistance from the DOH; 

2. Only facilities identiﬁed in the facility map shall receive allocation from the program. 

e. Health Facilities Enhancement Program. Funds for health facilities upgrading are distributed to regions and provinces inversely proportional to the hospital bed to population ratio. 

i. Determine regional ceilings by: 

1. Get the inverse of hospital beds to population ratio of the region by dividing l with the hospital beds to population ratio using list of PhilHealth Accredited Facilities which should include public as well as private health facilities in the region 

2. Add the amounts in #1 above to get the total inverse hospital beds to population ratio of all regions 

3. Compute for the proportion of inverse hospital beds to pOpulation ratio by dividing inverse regional hospital beds to population ratio with the inverse national hospital beds to pepulation ratio 

4. Multiply the proportion of hospital beds to population ratio with the total amount to be transferred to LGUs to get the regional ceilings. 

ii. Allocate regional ceilings to provinces by: 

1. Computing for the hospital beds to population ratio of the province using the list of PhilHealth Accredited Facilities which should include public as well as private facilities in the province “ 

2. Get the inverse ratio of hospital beds to p0pulation and compute for the prOportion by dividing inverse hospital beds to population ratio of the province with the inverse hospital beds to population ratio of the region 

3. Multiply the proportion of hospital beds to population ratio with the regional ceilings to get the provincial ceilings 

iii. Allocate the provincial ceilings to health facilities in the province by following these rules: 

1. Only facilities identiﬁed in the rationalization plan shall receive allocation from the program 

2. Prioritize facilities in the province that have not received any assistance from the program in the last two years 

3. Health facilities that will receive allocation from the program shall be prioritized as follows: a. Rural Health Units (RHUs) especially those accredited by PhilHealth to provide Out-Patient Beneﬁt Package (OPB) b. District hospitals serving as co-referral hospitals of Inter-Local Health Zones (ILHZ) 

f. Provision for Potable Water Supply. Using the proportion of households with no access to water as basis, the regional and provincial ceilings are determined by: 

i. Add the number of household in waterless municipalities, identiﬁed in the NAPC list. Aggregate households with no access to water into provinces and into regions. 

ii. Get the proportion of households with no access to water in the region. 

iii. Allocate at least PhP 25,000,000 to all regions to ensure minimum improvements in water supply of LGUs within a region. 

iv. Allocate the remaining amount to all the regions by multiplying the proportion of households with no access to water of the region with the remaining amount after deducting the total baseline amount allocated to the region above 

v. Allocate the regional ceiling to provinces within the region by multiplying the proportion of households with no access to water with the regional ceiling. 

Annex shows indicative regional and provincial ceilings for the different budget line items. These are indicative ﬁgures pending approval of the General Appropriations Acc (GAA) of 2010 and ﬁnalization of the Work and Financial Plans (WFP) of concerned units.
