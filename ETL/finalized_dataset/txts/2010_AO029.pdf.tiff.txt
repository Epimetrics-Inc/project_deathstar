<body>
I. BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE 

The Philippines is frequently affected by calamities caused by natural, human-generated, and technological hazards which result to loss of lives, destruction of properties and disruption of basic services, among others. In order to mitigate the effects of disasters and emergencies, a system for monitoring, coordination, and evaluation of these events needs to be institutionalized. 

Presidential Decree 1566 “Strengthening the Philippine Disaster Control Capability and Establishing a National Program on Community Disaster” mandates the Department of Health (DOH) as the primary agency within the National Disaster Coordinating Council (NDCC) to address speciﬁc health concerns related to emergencies and disasters Also Republic Act 10121 “An act Strengthening the Philippine Disaster Risk Reduction and Management System, providing for the National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Framework and Institutionalizing the National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Plan, appropriating ﬁinds therefore and for other purposes” under Section 2a declaration of policy states that the “policy of the State upholds the people’s constitutional right to life and property by addressing the root cause of vulnerability to disasters, strengthening the country’s institutional capacity for disaster risk reduction and management and building the resilience of local communities to disaster including climate change impact”. 

Administrative Order 168 s.2004 on “National Policy on Health Emergencies and Disasters” and Administrative Order No. 155 entitled “Implementing Guidelines for Managing Mass Casualty Incidents During Emergencies and Disasters” mandate the Centers for Health Development (CHDs) and DOH hospitals, as the regional forefront of health services, to continuously report and update the DOH on all emergencies and disasters with impact on health in their respective jurisdictions. Administrative Order No. 24 3.2008, or the “Adoption and Integration of the Code Alert System”, was put in place to efﬁciently mobilize and deploy resources and to describe the expected level of preparation and response of the Department of Health during emergencies and disasters. 

To support the implementation of those policies, the CHDs and DOH hospitals should strengthen or maintain operations centers in their facilities to monitor and manage all health and health-related events at their level and to make all the information needed by the DOH- HEMS Operation Center available for decision-making, resource mobilization, and coordination that maybe required in effectively dealing with such events. Emergency and disaster response would require the CHDs and hospitals to adopt a system that would facilitate a rapid organizational shift from a day to day operation to a heightened mode of action. In some instances, the CHD will need to establish an on-site operation center to direct ground operations while CHD or hospital-based operation center plan and coordinate responses and mobilize additional resources. Hence all health facilities from National to Local should establish an operation center. 

II. OBJECTIVES 

A. General 

To provide policies and guidelines in the establishment of Operation Center (OPCEN) at all levels from the national to the local government to ensure a well- coordinated response of the health sector. 

B. Specific 

1. To develop policies and guidelines on the establishment and management of an OPCEN. 

2. To identify the functions of an OPCEN at the different levels. 

3. To identify minimum speciﬁcations for the design of an OPCEN. 

4. To identify minimum standard for logistical requirements (i.e., equipment, supplies, furnishings, materials, etc) needed in an OPCEN. 

5. To identify human resource requirements for the operation of an OPCEN. 

6. To identify the coordination mechanism and the relationship among OPCENS. 

7. To identify the source of funding to ensure sustainability of Operation. 

III. SCOPE AND COVERAGE
