<subject>SUBJECT: Policies and Guidelines on the Prevention of Mother to Child Transmission (PMTCT) of Human Immunodeﬁciency Virus (HIV) </subject>

<body>
I. RATIONALE 

AIDS has become a leading cause of illness and death among women of reproductive age notably, in countries with a high burden of HIV infection. At the end of December 2007, about 33.2 million people were living with HIV worldwide. About half of these populations are women and at least two million are children younger than 15 years of age. About half a million babies become infected with HIV before birth, during delivery or through breastfeeding.^1 

Global coverage of PMTCT services is still low. By end of 2004, more than 100 countries already established PMTCT programs but only 16 of which were able to achieve national coverage. In 2006, at least eight countries have exceeded the 40% antiretroviral (ARV) prophylaxis uptake mark required to achieve the 2005 PMTCT target of the United Nations General Assembly Special Sessions (UNGASS).^2 

The Philippines HIV and AIDS Registry, as of February 2009 reported a cumulative total of 3,701 HIV cases. As of February 2009, there is a cumulative total of 52 HIV cases that are passed on through mother to child transmission (MTCT). There were two (2) MTCT cases reported for the lSt quarter of 2009. 

Although Philippines is classified as a low prevalence country, HIV program response is currently focused and scaled up among the most at risk and vulnerable populations and communities. The country needs to mount HIV prevention of mother to child transmission (PMTCT) program appropriate to the country’s needs. In line with this direction, there is a need to come up with policies and guidelines on PMTCT that shall serve as a guide for health care providers all over the country.

2 WHO Guidance on global scale-up of the prevention of mother-to—child transmission of HIV ( Towards universal access for women, infants and young Children and eliminating HIV and AIDS among children) 2007 


II. OBJECTIVES General Objective: 

To provide policies and guidelines on the prevention of mother to child transmission of HIV that shall be used by health care providers nationwide. 

Speciﬁc Objectives: 

1. To describe the different components of PMTCT at all levels of health care. 
2. To deﬁne the roles and responsibilities of the different DOH Ofﬁces and other agencies in the implementation of the PMTCT guidelines. 

III. SCOPE AND COVERAGE 

These guidelines are intended to provide guidance on PMTCT of HIV among Sexually Transmitted. Infection (STI), Maternal and Child Health (MCH), Family Planning (FP), sexual and reproductive health (SRH) service providers covering public and private, community- based health facilities and the civil society. 

IV. DEFINITION OF TERMS 

1. Antiretroviral (ARV) — drugs that are given to people living with HIV infection in order to improve or maintain their immune function. 

2. Guideline on the Integrated Management of Pediatric HIV and AIDS- ready reference adapted by the Department which is intended to serve as a guide for health service providers in the management of children with HIV/AIDS. 

3. HIV Counseling and Testing — a conﬁdential process that enables individuals to examine their knowledge and behavior in relation to their personal risks of acquiring or transmitting HIV. Counseling helps an individual decide on whether or not to undergo HIV testing and provides support to an individual receiving his or her test result. 

4. Prevention of Mother to Child Transmission (PMTCT) - set of interventions with an aim of preventing the spread of HIV among infants and children. 

5. Replacement feeding - giving an infant who is not receiving any breast milk a nutritionally adequate diet until the age at which the child can be fully fed on family foods. 

6. Social Hygiene Clinics- these are clinics at the local government unit that is usually part of the municipal health ofﬁce or city health ofﬁce that provides STI services. 

7. Treatment hubs — a hospital facility with an established HIV/AIDS Core Team (HACT) providing prevention, treatment care and support services to People Living with HIV (PLHIV) including but not limited to HIV counseling and testing, clinical management, patient monitoring and other care and support services. ARV treatment can only be accessed through these facilities. Refer to Annex I for the list of treatment hubs. 

V. PREVENTION OF MOTHER TO CHILD TRANSMISSION (PMTCT) FRAMEWORK 

The PMTCT framework adopts the United Nations’ comprehensive four-element strategy to prevent HIV among infants and young children. It has four (4) prongs whichafedescribed below: 

Prong 1. Primary prevention of HIV among women of childbearing age 

This approach is focused on women of child bearing age with an aim of maintaining their HIV negative status by involving their partners in the STI/HIV prevention. 

Prong 2. Preventing unintended pregnancies among women living with HIV 

This approach emphasizes the importance of providing appropriate counselling and support to women living with HIV to make informed decision about their future reproductive life, with special emphasis on preventing unintended pregnancies. 

Prong 3. Preventing HIV transmission from a women living with HIV to her infant 

This intervention involves providing women living with HIV with proper treatment, care and support through strengthening of reproductive health services in order to prevent transmission of HIV to their infants. 

Prong 4. Providing appropriate treatment, care and support to women living with HIV, their children and their families 

This component is focused on providing women and children an integrated care and support services including prevention and treatment of sexually transmitted infections, tuberculosis, family planning, nutritional support and other services that are essential for improving health outcomes of both mother and child. 

VI. COMPONENTS OF PMTCT 

Based on the above framework, the following are the different components of PMTCT that must be incorporated to the existing SRH and Maternal Newborn and Child Health and Nutrition (MNCHN) services: 

1. Information and Education 

All women and their partners shall be given basic and essential information on STI, HIV and AIDS including PMTCT through either individual or group education. They shall also be given information on the availability and accessibility of HIV counseling and testing services.

b. Does client or partner have or in the past suffered from symptoms of STI (genital tract symptoms such as dysuria, discharge or sores)? 
c. Does client or partner have history of injecting drugs? 
d. Does client or partner have history of undergoing voluntary HIV counseling and testing? 

3. STI Case Management 

All women and partners diagnosed to have STI either by syndromic or etiologic approach should receive proper management based on Administrative Order No. 5-A s. 2003, “Revised National Sexually Transmitted Infectious Case Management Guidelines”. 

4. HIV Counseling and Testing 

All women and partners identiﬁed with having one or more risk factors shall be offered HIV counseling and testing. For women who refused to undergo HIV testing, health care providers shall offer HIV test on her subsequent visits. Once the client has agreed to undergo the test, the principles of counselling and testing such as informed consent and conﬁdentiality shall be observed at all times. 

Women who tested HIV-negative shall be given counselling on risk reduction interventions, focusing mainly on how to” maintain their HIV-negative status. All women who tested positive shall receive counseling on available PMTCT services, including family planning options. Likewise, all partners of women infected with HIV shall be offered HIV counseling and testing. 

5. Counseling on the Prevention of Unintended Pregnancies 

All women living with HIV and their partners shall receive counseling on family planning including information and access to safe and effective contraception methods to contribute on informed decision-making about pregnancy choices. They shall also be given proper and complete information on the PMTCT program and availability of essential care and support servwes 

6. Referral to Treatment Hubs 

All women and partners who tested positive for HIV shall be referred to the nearest treatment hub in order to access proper treatment and care such as antiretroviral (ARV) prophylaxis and treatment. 

7. ARV Treatment and Prophylaxis for HIV-Infected Pregnant Women and Their Newborn 

Antiretroviral Therapy (ART) is initiated among treatment eligible HIV infected pregnant women. ARV prophylactic regimen is provided to HIV infected pregnant women with no indication for ART (see Annex II). 

All newborns of HIV infected pregnant women shall be given ARV prophylactic regimen (see Annex II). For conﬁrmed HIV infected infants, ART is initiated based on the Guideline on the Integrated Management of Pediatric HIV and AIDS. 

8. Management of Labor and Delivery of HIV Positive Pregnant Women 

HIV infected pregnant women who are about to deliver should be referred and admitted to the nearest treatment hub. The attending physician should consider vaginal delivery if the following criteria are satisfied: 
- HIV medications have been taken during pregnancy 
- no previous uterine surgery or elective cesarean section 
- no signs and symptoms of STI 
- no indications of prolonged labor. 

Cesarean section is recommended if vaginal delivery cannot be performed due to presence of contraindications. Cesarean section should be scheduled prior to the rupture of the membrane. 

HIV infected pregnant women need not be isolated during labor and delivery because of their HIV status. Hospital staff must use stande precautions in all patients regardless of their status. 

9. Counseling of HIV Infected Mothers Regarding Feeding Options for Their Infants 

Counseling of HIV infected mothers should include information about the risk and beneﬁts of exclusive breastfeeding and exclusive replacement feeding and guidance in selecting the most suitable option in their circumstances. 

Exclusive breastfeeding is recommended for HIV infected for the first six (6) months of life unless replacement feeding is acceptable, feasible, affordable, sustainable and safe (AF ASS) for them and their infants before that time. Mixed feeding must be avoided. 

Breastfeeding mothers of infants and young children who are known to be HIV infected should be strongly encouraged to continue breastfeeding.
