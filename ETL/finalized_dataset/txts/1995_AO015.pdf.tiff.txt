<subject>SUBJECT: Reinstitution of the Previous Tetanus Toxoid Vaccination Schedule</subject>


<body>

Because the target women beneficiaries of the tetanus toxoid vaccine being administered by the Department of Health have not been coming for immunization because of fear of abortion, there is a need to reinstitute the previous Tetanus Toxoid Immunization schedule to allay their fears.

Routine tetanus toxoid vaccination shall be given only to women who are already in their 5th or 6th month of pregnancy. The revised tetanus toxoid immunization schedule shall be as follows:

As much as possible, no mother should be given more than 5 Tetanus Toxoid doses in her lifetime.

Selected far flung areas with a high percentage of deliveries by untrained hilots and with high rates of neonatal tetanus cases shall be identified by the Maternal and Child Health Service as High Neonatal Tetanus Risk Areas. In these few areas, Tetanus Toxoid immunization may be given to nonâ€”pregnant women to complete TT5 doses. However, to avoid being associated with abortion, tetanus toxoid even in these areas should be avoided during the first trimester of pregnancy.

This Order takes effect immediately.

For strict compliance.
