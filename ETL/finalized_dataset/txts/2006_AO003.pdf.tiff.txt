<body>

I. RATIONALE

Republic Act No. 7277, “An Act Providing for the Rehabilitation, Self-Development, and Self-Reliance of Disabled Persons and Their Integration into the Mainstream of Society and for Other Purposes.” and otherwise known as “The Magna Carta for Disabled Persons,” was passed in July 19, 1991. This speciﬁcally required the Department of Health (DOH) to, (1) institute a national health program for PWDs, (2) establish medical rehabilitation centers in provincial hospitals, and (3) adopt an integrated and comprehensive approach to the health development of PWD which shall make essential health services available to them at affordable cost.

Rule IV, Section 4, Paragraph B of the implementing rules and regulations (IRR) of this Act required the Department of Health to address the health concerns of seven (7) different categories of disability, which includes the following: (1) Psychosocial and behavioral disabilities, (2) Chronic illnesses with disabilities, (3) Learning (cognitive or intellectual) disabilities, (4) Mental disabilities, (5) Visual / seeing disabilities, (6) Orthopedic/moving, and; (7) Communication deficits.

In compliance thereof, the DOH piloted in 1995 a community based rehabilitation program in 112 (7.5%) out of 1, 492 towns nationwide. Between 1992 and 2004 it had upgraded DOH hospital facilities to include rehabilitation and allied medical services for PWDs. Today there are about 21 DOH hospitals that have a rehabilitation program/units/centers representing 22% of all DOH hospitals. It had registered 508,270 PWDs in 2004 or about 12% of the target PWD population. (Source: DOH Report 2004). The turn out was inﬂuenced by the presence, absence or inadequacy of health services for PWDs at the local or regional level and in DOH health facilities..A Social Weather Station (SWS) survey commissioned by DOH last 2004 revealed that around 7% of the households under the study have at least one family member who is disabled. (Source: SWS Survey 2004) . With the frontline services of the Department of Health devolved to the local government units, the ﬁnal implementation of this Act now rests with the Local Government Units (LGUs). This Order prescribes the guidelines in the formulation, implementation, and evaluation of health programs for PWDs.

II. DECLARATION OF POLICIES
