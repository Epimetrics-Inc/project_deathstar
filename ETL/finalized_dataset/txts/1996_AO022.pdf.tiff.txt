<subject>SUBJECT: Amendment of Administrative Order No. 1 s. 1996 dated January 15, 1996</subject>

<body>

With the passage of the Local Government Code (LGC) of 1991 (RA 7160) and its subsequent implementation the Department of Health (DOH) assumes a new role with regards to Primary Health Care (PHC). Instead of being more implementor of health services the DOH becomes facilitator of processes to ensure meaningful participation of all significant sectors particularly the communities and the marginalized. This new role necessarily requires DOH to assist the communities and Local Government Units (LGUs) to become responsible partners and managers of community health development at local levels. In line with this new role, Administrative Order No. 1 s. 1996 dated January 15,1996 on Regional PHC Fund Allocation is hereby amended as follows:

The Regional PHC fund directly released to the Regional Field Ofﬁces by the respective Regional Budget and Management ofﬁces shall be utilized primarily in support of community based/managed health activities/projects/programs. At least 50% of the total Regional PHC funds shall be used in support of the following activities/projects/programs:

1. Grants to support LGUs/NGOs/POs in PCHD areas and other community-based health projects
2. Botica ng Barangay (BnB)
3. Training of Barangay Health Workers (BHWs)

The Regional PHC funds shall also be used to support all other priority activities/projects/programs for the year. The funds to be utilized for the following other priority programs including the contingency shall not exceed 50% of the total Regional PHC funds:

1. People’s Health Day
2. Alternative Health Sciences Education (AHSE) for Regions with AHSE
3. President’s Youth Work Program (PYWP)
4. Contingency


The speciﬁc breakdown or percentage distribution of the speciﬁc activities as to the total PHC funds shall be determined by the Regional PHC coordinator in consultation with the concerned program coordinators and as approved by the Regional Director. These priorities and activities shall be reﬂected in the Work and Financial plan for PHC of the Region which the RHO will submit to the Office of the Secretary of Health copy furnished the Community Health Service.

All disbursements of the grant funds under PHC shall comply with COA Circular No. 95-003 dated February 15, 1995. 

The PHC funds intended for CARAGA Region directly released to Region 10 (for Agusan Norte, Agusan Sur and Surigao Norte) and Region 11 (for Surigao Sur) by the Regional Budget and Management Officer shall be sub-alloted to CARAGA Region. CARAGA Region shall liquidate funds to the respective Regional Field Ofﬁces.

All other contents/provisions of AO-1 s. 1996 not contrary to this AO shall still be enforced. The speciﬁc guidelines for each program/proiect consistent with this AO shall likewise be followed.

For strict compliance.
