I. Rationale 

The Centers for Health Development (CHDs) as described in Department . Order 2011-0188 or the Kalusugan Pangkalahatan (KP) Execution Plan and Implementation Arrangements are the front line managers of KP implementation. Under the present organizational set-up, the DOH through the CHDs influences the manner by which LGUs govern lOcal health systems. The DOH Representatives (DOH Reps) play an important part in the CHDs’ role of facilitating and coordinating the strengthening of local health systems to provinces and cities in implementing the - national health thrusts and directions. 

The roles and functions of DOH Reps in support of national health thrusts and directions are found in Administrative Order 135 s.2004. However, despite issuance of said AO, many DOH Reps are still confused on their roles and functions, and they have not been fully able to perform their main role as facilitator and advisor on local health reforms. In the Final Report “Support to the Strengthening of Capacity Development Systems for DOH CO and CHDs” submitted by Breternitz, et al in September 2010, it was found that DOH Reps often seem to face fundamental capacity problems, such as unclear and overlapping roles and functions, and limited decision power. DOH Reps often have limited authority to decide on both downstream and upstream processes. Such ambiguities in role delineations often 
result in ineffective performance of their expected functions. 

Results of past consultations with selected staff from the CHDs and Provincial Health Officers (PHOs) also showed the need to update and revise the existing roles and functions of DOH Reps, based on Section 47 of the‘DOH Implementing Rules and Regulations of the Local Government Code, roles and functions of CHDs from DO No. 2009-0153, and DO No. 2011-0188. 

In the light of existing studies, past consultations and new policy developments, a new issuance on the definition of roles, functions and responsibilities of DOH Reps nationwide is necessary. This policy envisions the DOH Reps to become more focused, responsiVe and effective CHD Staff and LGU partner through the Local Health Boards. 

II. Objective
