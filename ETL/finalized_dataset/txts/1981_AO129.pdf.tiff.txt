4. That leave applications for vacation leave of absence submitted for approval at this organizational level shall carry the statement of the head of office/chief of hospital to the effect that the services of the applicant can be spared for the period requested.

5. That where a portion of the leave of absence of a nationally paid employee is without pay, regardless of the duration thereof, such application shall, as heretofore, be approved by the Regional Health Director or any duly authorized official on the regional level so that payroll deductions can be effected promptly.

6. That no personnel with a pending formal administrative charge against him shall be granted leave with pay during the pendency of the case. Accordingly, a certification of the immediate supervisor or by the requesting office that the applicant has no pending formal administrative case shall be included as a supporting paper to the application.

7. That leave applications submitted for approval of the Provincial or City Health Officer concerned shall always be supported by an updated leave control form duly certified by the hospital/provincial/city health office administrative officer and noted by the chief of hospital or provincial/city health officer. Otherwise, such applications shall be returned promptly for compliance with this requirement.

8. That requests for commutation of salary incident to leave, regardless of the nature or duration thereof, shall as heretofore be approved by the Regional Health Director or any duly authorized official on the regional level;

In order to strengthen the administrative expertise of the offices concerned, it is important that before actual implementation of this delegation, a reconciliation of leave records at the Regional Health Office level and the offices and hospitals concerned be immediately undertaken. In addition, the necessary training of personnel to be utilized for the purpose, in the interest of greater accuracy, authenticity and integrity of leave records and orientation on rulings by the Civil Service Commission shall be undertaken immediately with the assistance of Regional Health Office personnel.

The Regional Health Director, Regional Health Office No. 8 shall submit a report on the results of the Pilot Project in terms of its impact on administrative efficiency, supervision and coordination of health activities at the provincial or city level of health organization, as well as any modifications that would provide greater effectiveness in the integration of health and medical work at this level.

All orders inconsistent herewith are hereby rescinded or amended accordingly.
