<subject>SUBJECT: Procedural Guidelines on the Procurement, Inspection, and Distribution of various Drugs and Medicines under the Low-Cost Medicine Program of the Department of Health (DOH) in collaboration with the Philippine International Trading Corporation and other Government entities mandated and authorized to Undertake procurement and distribution in favor of the DOH</subject>

<body>
I. Rationale

In accordance with the goals, strategies and action of the Medium Term Philippine Development Plan 2004-2010 (Chapter 12. II. a), that is to: "reduce the cost of medicines commonly bought by the poor to half of their 2004 prices and make these available nationwide through a distribution network as determined by the DOH, in coordination with PITC," the Department of Health has spearheaded the establishment of Botika ng Barangay Village Drug Outlets and DOH Botikas under the Retained Hospitals. The Department of Health, facilitates the identification and quantification of drug demands, which are procured by the Philippine International Trading Corporation (PITC), whenever their price offers are reasonable and are distributed to specific sites identified by the Department of Health.

Recent Audit Observation Memoranda (AOM) issued by the Commission on Audit (COA), to the Department of Health (DOH) revealed that there are areas in the management of the low-cost medicine program that further require fine- tuning to ensure efficiency, transparency, and to preclude unnecessary wastage of resources. Specifically there is a need to clearly define the roles and responsibilities of participating units in the program so that the right goods and services are delivered at the right time, at the right place, with right quantity to the right recipients and to provide the right information through an automatic feedback and monitoring mechanism that would help decision-making.
