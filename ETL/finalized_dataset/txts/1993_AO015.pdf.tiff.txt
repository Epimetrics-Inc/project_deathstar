<doctype>ADMINISTRATIVE ORDER</doctype>
<docnum>No. 15, s. 1993</docnum>  

 <subject>Subject: Banning smoking in all health care facilities under the Department of Health</subject>


<body>
       It is now an established fact that smoking is toxic, hazardous, and addicting. The adverse health effects of smoking result in serious illnesses, notably lung cancer, cardiovascular diseases and chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases, among others. Smoking is also the single most important risk factor in the country today and this habit must be put under control in order to promote and safeguard the constitutional right of every citizen to a healthy life.

	Thus, health workers need to fully understand their role in advocating a healthy lifestyle. Health facilities must indeed be the windows to a tobacco—free world and by serving as role models to the people they serve. One way to realize this is to create a smoke-free environment in all health facilities under the Department of Health.

	For this purpose, regional health offices, hospitals/medical centers, and all other health facilities under the administrative supervision of the Department of Health are hereby declared “SMOKE FREE ZONES”

	Henceforth, smoking in the building compounds of these facilities as well as the sale of cigarettes, cigars and other tobacco products shall be strictly prohibited. 
	Moreover, chiefs of health care facilities are enjoined to print, as appropriate, the caption ”SMOKING IS DANGEROUS TO HEALTH” on their official stationeries and other legal papers.

	All Heads of Offices, Chiefs of Medical/Specialty/Special
Hospitals and others concerned are directed to lead in the anti-smoking campaigns in their respective areas of assignment. Ample time and appropriate means of communication should be provided for everyone to understand the DOH No Smoking Policy, inclusive of the c1ients/beneficiaries/patients/visitors, in health facilities. Supervisors concerned are also enjoined to design and provide measures and mechanisms such as sanctions/appropriate penalties, and or granting incentives/awards towards the effective implementation of this activity. Copy of such measures shall be submitted to the Office of the Secretary within a period not to exceed sixty (60) days upon receipt of this Order.

	This Order takes effect immediately.
