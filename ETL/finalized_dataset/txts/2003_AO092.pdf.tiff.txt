<subject>SUBJECT: Revised Policies and Guidelines on the Private Practice of Medical and Paramedical Professionals in Government Health Facilities.</subject>

<body>
I. Rationale

The Department of Health encourages the employment of medical and paramedical personnel who are experts in their field of practice in various government hospitals and other government health facilities. Within the period of their employment in these government facilities, these practitioners are allowed the privilege of private practice.

Private practice is allowed as an incentive and in recognition of the medical and paramedical professionals’ commitment to remain as members of the hospital staff for a longer period to bring about continuous quality improvement of the health care delivery service of the facility.

This permission on the private practice of medical and paramedical professionals in government health facilities is envisioned to attract the best and the brightest professionals for medical and paramedical positions, in order to 1) provide adequate quality medical care to patients especially the indigent; 2) teach, train and interact with the other medical and paramedical professionals and; 3) conduct relevant studies and research thereby enhancing the quality of medical and health care delivery systems.

in addition, the following are the expected benefits in allowing private practice of government medical and paramedical personnel in government hospitals and other health facilities:

1. The presence of Medical Specialists within the hospital during office hours, who otherwise would be in their other private clinics, ensures supervision and guidance of patient care at the time they are needed most.

2. The inputs from other government health professionals would further enrich and enhance the healthcare delivery system.

3. Resident trainees will be more closely supervised and thereto gain much from assisting consultants in the management of the consultants' private patients. They can learn medical evaluation and management which they would not otherwise experience.

4. The income generated from the use of hospital facilities by private patients will augment the hospital budget and promote self-sufficiency towards fiscal autonomy.

However, due to exiSting Civil Service regulations, administrative and ethical issues on medical and other paramedical practitioners in government facilities engaging in private practice became a major concern. There is a need to balance the need for these professionals and the expected benefits that the government health facilities will reap with the existing Civil Service regulations.

Therefore a set of policies and guidelines is hereby formulated to determine the coverage, limitation and responsibility of all concerned in the delivery of quality health care services.
