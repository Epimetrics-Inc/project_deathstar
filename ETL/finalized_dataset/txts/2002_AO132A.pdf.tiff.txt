<subject>Subject: Revised DOH Performance Evaluation System</subject>

<body>
Consistent with the Revised Policies on Performance Evaluation System embodied under CSC Resolution No. 991792 and CSC MC No. 13 s. 1999 the Department of Health adopts the herein Performance Evaluation System to be referred to as DOH-PES, which policies are anchored on the concepts of the Revised Rules.

I. Policies

1. The DOH-PES adheres to the principle of performance-based security of tenure. It provides motivation and basis for incentives to performers and applies sanctions to non-performers.

2. The DOH-PES operates on shared commitments and objective measures of performance results Performance targets and standards or measures of results are planned and agreed upon by management, supervisors and employees;

3. The DOH-PES enhances productivity by using performance targets and standards attuned to organizational goals and mandate;

4. The DOH-PES recognizes the role of multi-stakeholders in the objective assessment and feedbacking on individual employee performance. It utilizes a cross-rating system between and among supervisors, subordinates, peers and the employee-ratee; and

5. The DOH-PES promotes transparency and provides mechanism for appeals and resolution of conflicts and/or disagreements.

II. Objectives

The DOH-PES aims:

1. To continuously foster improvement of employee performance and efficiency;
2. To enhance organizational effectiveness and productivity; and
3. To provide an objective performance rating which serves as basis for personnel actions, incentives and rewards and administrative sanctions.

III. Definition of Terms

1. Supervisor Rater (SR) - refers to the immediate and direct supervisor of the employee/staff being rated, who by the nature of his/her position or authority assigns work to the employee, monitors and evaluates the same on the basis of agreed targets and standards.

2. Employee Ratee - refers to the staff or employee whose performance is being reviewed and evaluated by his/her immediate supervisor on the basis of agreed targets and standards, as well as on the behavioral requirements of the assigned job and also referred to as Self-Rater (SeR).

3. Supervisor (S) - employee who holds a position that requires supervisory functions based on the organizational structure. Examples: Division Chiefs, Section Chiefs, Unit Heads, Department Heads, and the like.

4. Non-Supervisor (NS) - employee who holds technical or non-technical position that does not have supervisory functions based on the organizational structure.

5. Organizational Target - refers to short-range (annual or semi-annual) expected accomplishments set to achieve objectives that are attuned to the DOH's vision, mission and values in general and to the concerned offices' in particular.

6. Employee Performance Target - refers to the duties or work assignments given by the rater to the ratee, with the WORK OUTPUT of each duty clearly stated by the rater and understood by the ratee. These work outputs should be measured with a standard at least in quality, quantity and time set either by the Office concerned or by mutual agreement of the rater and the ratee concerned.
 
7. Performance Standards - refer to the measure or yardstick against which performance level is assessed.

8. Intervening Tasks - are those which are neither inherent nor directly related to the employee's plantilla or designated position and may include memberships in ad hoc committees, research work and other similar assignments which require a considerable amount of effort and time of the employee.

9. Performance Factor - refer to the evaluation of actual accomplishment versus the planned level of performance in terms of Quality (QL), Quantity (QN) and Timeliness of work based on pre-set standards by management or agreed upon by the rater and ratee.

10. Critical Factor - refers to the different behavioral factors that affect the job performance of the employee.

11. Peer Rater (PR) - refers to the co-worker of the employee-ratee who has the same position title or functionally-related position of comparable level within the same organizational unit who may either have direct or indirect working relationship with a peer whose performance is being rated.

12. Subordinate Rater (SuR) - refers to the employee/staff who rates his/her immediate supervisor on the basis of verifiable and observable work accomplishments and behavior.

13. Head of Agency - refers to the Director of a certain Service, Bureau, Center for Health Development or hospitals on either a permanent or designated capacity.

IV. Scope and Coverage

The DOH-PES applies to all first and second level employees in the career service. These include Central Office, Centers for Health Development, special and Specialty Hospitals and retained/renationalized hospitals. It may also apply to non-career service whenever appropriate.

V. Rating Period

Performance evaluation is done every six (6) months ending on June 30 and December 30 of every year. However, if there is a need for a shorter or a longer period, the minimum appraisal period is at least ninety (90) calendar days or three (3) months while the maximum is not longer than one (1) calendar year.

VI. Procedures

1. Creation and Operations of Performance Evaluation Review Committee (PERC)

1.1 Composition

The PERC shall be formed composed of the following:

<image>table_1.png</image>

<image>table_2.png</image>

Heads of Division/Dept/Section shall automatically be a member of the PERC during the review of their subordinates performance targets and rating.

First and second level representatives shall be chosen through a general election or the like shall be held only in the absence of an accredited union. Otherwise, the union shall designate the same. Rank and file members have one to two years term.

Both members have one to two years term.

1.2 Responsibilities

1.2.1 Review of Employees Performance Targets

The PERC initiates the review and comparative assessment of employee's performance targets to ensure rationalization of employee workload particularly of those holding similar positions and working under same work conditions and recommends necessary modifications or corrective action, if necessary

1.2.2. Review ofPerformanee Standards

The PERC reviews performance standards adopted for each duty of a position in the different organizational units in the DOH Central Office/ CHD/Hospitals. It also ensures the adoption of uniform standards of measurements in rating employees holding similar positions, performing similar functions and working under same conditions.

1.2.3 Determination ofFinai rating

At the end of the rating period, the PERC reviews only performance evaluation forms with ratings of Outstanding (O), Unsatisfactory (US), Poor (P) and those with appeal. It completes the review and approval of employees' rating not later than 30 days after the HRMO/ Personnel Office has submitted the same to the former.

1.2.4 Monitoring and Evaluation of DOH-PES

The PERC monitors and evaluates the effectiveness of the DOH-PES annually and effects and implements improvements essential to ensure its continued suitability to the different positions and needs of the Agency.

1.2.5 Setting of Internal Rates and Procedures

The PERC may adept its own internal rules, procedures and strategies in carrying out the above responsibilities including the setting of schedule of meetings and deliberations, creation of Secretariat and delegation of authority to representatives in case of absence of its members.

2. Setting of Performance Targets and Standards

2.1 Organizational Targets

Not later than the last quarter preceding the rating period is devoted to preparation and setting of organizational targets which are attuned to the vision and mission of the DOH in general and the concerned offices.

2.2 Employee Targets

Each employee must prepare performance targets using the prescribed Evaluation Form (PEF-1) based on the organizational targets set by the concerned offices and the work program of the division or organizational unit where he belongs. These targets must relate to specific job functions and organizational needs.

Employee Performance Target refers to the duties or work assignments given by competent authority (rater) to the employee (ratee), with each work segment properly measured with a standard either on quantity, quality, on time and mutually agreed upon by both rater and ratee.

2.3 Setting of Performance Standards

Each employee also sets his performance standards together with his targets.

Performance standard is a measure or yardstick against which performance level is assessed. It is the product of mutual agreement among the division chief concerned, supervisor, and employee. This includes measures of quality, quantity and timeliness.

Individual employee's performance standards should not be lower than the agency's standards as reflected in one's individual Performance Agreement.

2.4 Confirmation

Employee's performance targets are confirmed by the PERC before the rating period but not later than the 15th day of the start of the rating period. Performance targets become final or valid in case the PERC failed to act on it within 15 working days upon submission.

The PERC through the concerned division chiefs or unit heads may cause appropriate corrective action whenever there is disparity in the distribution of assignment and workload among employees.

2.5 Modification

Modification/adjustment on previously approved planned targets may be allowed when an employee is given special assignments that would significantly affect the establishment of the original targets.

The concerned employee must give due notice to PERC of such modifications for confirmation.

3. Progress Review

The supervisor and the ratee meet at least every 2 months to review progress of work accomplishments. They focus their review or discussion on problems and difficulties encountered and find ways to resolve the same.

They also discuss and agree on certain checkpoints in terms of schedule and output status in order to ensure accomplishment of the tasks.

4. Appraisal Discussion and Rating Proper

At the end of the evaluation period, the supervisor and the employee meet to discuss the latter's accomplishments against established targets and standards. They both give their ratings in the prescribed form and settle/discuss differences, if any.

The supervisor gathers, tabulates, summarizes and presents to the Employee-Ratee the subordinate, peer and client ratings.

Together, they compute the overall performance rating of the employee using the prescribed weight allocation and computation under this System.

Comments and recommendations are required in the space provided for in PEF-1 to serve as guide in improving employee performance in subsequent evaluation periods and in other appropriate personnel actions.

VII. MECHANICS OF RATING

1. Level of Performance

Each employee is rated on the basis of the levels of performance set below:

<image>table_3.png</image>

In determining the final equivalent adjectival rating of the employee, the range of overall point scores is converted as follows:

<image>table_4.png</image>

2. Components of Rating

The overall rating of employees for a given rating period consists of two (2) parts: Part I - Performance and Part 11 - Critical Factors.

2.1 Part 1 - Performance

Part 1 - Performance is given a weight of 70% of the overall rating of the employees.

Rating on Part 1 - Performance is the evaluation of actual accomplishment versus the planned level of performance in terms of quantity, quality and timeliness of work based on pr-e -set standards by management or the supervisor and the ratee duly confirmed by the PERC.

2.2. Part II - Critical Factors

Part II - Critical Factors are given a weight of 30% of the overall rating of the employees.

Rating on Part II - Critical Factors reflect the behavioral dimensions that affect the job performance of an employee.

Each ratee must be rated on the following critical factors that affect his job performance.

1. Courtesy
2. Human relations
3. Integrity
4. Stress Tolerance
5. Initiative and Resourcefulness
6. Compliance to office rules and regulations
7. Punctuality and Attendance

For Supervisors, to include:

8. Leadership
9. Judgment/decision making

Attendance factor shall be classified into three (3) namely:

1. Tardiness - means reporting for work later than the official starting time
of work schedule of the employee.

10  - 0-2 times tardy during the last 6 months
8 - 3-6 times tardy
6 - 7-10 times tardy
4 - 11-15 times tardy
2 - more than 15 times tardy

2. Undertime - means leaving the office earlier than the required time of work of the employee.

10 - 0-2 times undertime
8 - 3-6 times undertime
6 - 7-10 times undertime
4 - 11-15 times undertime
2 - 16 or more times undertime

3. Absence - not reporting for work the whole day.

10 - 0-2 days absent
8 - 3-4 days absent
6 - 5-6 days absent
4 - 7-8 days absent
2 - 9 days or more absent

Approved sick leave, scheduled leave, maternity leave, paternity leave and privilege leave of absences are not included in the counting of the number of days absent.

Fifty percent (50%) of the rating of this factor is based on records such as DTR, bundy cards, pass slips and leave applications, etc. and on actual attendance or presence in the place of work as may be observed by the immediate supervisor.

To assess the actual attendance, the following rating scale shall be adopted:

10 - always within the working area or place of work.
8 - rarely not within the working area or place of work.
6 - often not within the working area or place of work.
4 - most of the time not within the working area or place of work.
2 - always not within the working area or place of work.

2.3 Performance of Intervening Tasks

The performance of intervening or additional tasks is duly considered only if these were done simultaneously with the planned targets.

Intervening tasks are those which are neither inherent nor directly related to employee's plantilla or designated positions and may include memberships in ad-hoc committees, research work and other similar assignments which require a considerable amount of effort and time of the employees and are duly covered by an office order.

Employee's performance of intervening tasks may be given a maximum of one (1) additional point to their overall rating provided the following criteria are met:

a. Said task is difficult, technical in nature or requiring special skills;

b. Said task is not within the regular functions of the employees or the work program/performance contract of their divisions or units;

c. There is urgency in the completion of the intervening task which has an impact on the organizational unit concerned.

d. Non-compliance/performance of the intervening task will unduly prejudice the service.

e. Employees' planned targets were all accomplished and rated at least satisfactorily; and

f. Performance or completion of said intervening task will require an aggregate period of one week to two months.

Special or additional assignments are no longer considered intervening tasks if it will significantly affect the performance of the employee's regular targets. In such a case, the same is treated as an allowable modifications of regular target as previously indicated.

3. Cross Rating

The DOH-PES uses a cross rating scheme which involves multiple raters other than the supervisor. Under this scheme, each rater is allocated percentage weight. The Percentage Weight Allocation (PWA) is as follows:

<image>table_5.png</image>

The peer rating shall only be applicable in rating the critical factors of the employee concerned.

For purposes of cross rating, the above raters are described as follows:

Supervisor Rater refers to the immediate and direct superior of the Employee-Ratee who by the nature of his position or authority given by a competent authority, assigns work to the employee, monitors and evaluates the same on the basis of agreed targets and standards. The Supervisor Rater rates the Employee-Ratee in both Part 1 - Performance and Part II - Critical Factors using the prescribed Performance Evaluation Form (PEF - 1)

Subordinate Rater refers to the employee under the immediate or direct supervision of a superior whose performance is to be rated on the basis of verifiable and observable work accomplishments and behavior of the latter. The Subordinate Rater rates his supervisor using the prescribed Subordinate Rater Form (PEF-2) consisting of set of questionnaires depicting the ratee's performance and demonstrated behavior for the rating period.

Peer Rater refers to the co-employee with the same position title or functionally-related positions of comparable level within the same organizational unit who may have either direct or indirect working relationships with a peer whose performance is to be rated. A peer is considered to have a direct working relationship with another peer if their work are dependent upon each other for support or in producing an output or achieving each other's target.

Indirect working relationship means that the Peer Rater and Peer Ratee perform similar work and scope of responsibility based on their approved appointment, salary grade, hierarchical leveling of positions and mandatory functions. The output of one is not necessarily dependent on another but can be noticed or observed by either of the two.

The Peer Rater rates the Peer Ratee using the prescribed "Peer Rater Form" (PEF-3). Only the averages of all peer ratings for both Part I and Part II are reflected in the final Performance Evaluation Form (PEF-1). The supervisor may assign one peer to consolidate, tabulate and summarize all peer ratings and upon his final review reflects the average rating in the PEF-1 during the appraisal discussion with the ratee.

Note: Each ratee is given free hand on how to select their raters.

4. How to Compute the Rating

4.1 Supervisor and Employee Ratings on Part I - Performance

1. During the appraisal discussion at the end of the rating period, the Supervisor Rater and the Employee Ratee fill up the accomplishment portion of the targets and accomplishments column of the PEF-1.

Afterwards, the rater rates accomplishment by comparing the targets against actual job accomplishments. The QL, QN and T standards earlier set are used in giving each accomplishment a numerical rating.

2. Add all the scores under QN, QL, and T for all work/activities rated and divide by the number of entries to get the respective Average Point Scores (APSs).

3. Multiply each Average Point Score by the Percentage Weight Allocation (PWA) as provided for under Item VII-3 to get the Weighted Average Score (WAS).

4.2 Self and Supervisor Rating on Part II

1. Using PEF-1, the Supervisor Rater rate each factor.

2. Add all scores then divide by the total number of entries to get their respective Average Point Scores (APSS) for Part II.

3. Multiply Average Point Score (APS) by Percentage Weight Allocation (PWA) to get the Weighted Average Score (WAS).

4.3 Subordinate(s)

1. Compute the average ratings of subordinate rater/s for Part I and Part II separately.

2. Multiply the resulting average ratings by 70% for Part I and 30% for Part II to get the Weighted Average Scores (WAS).

4.4 Peer(s)

1. Compute the Peer Rating by adding all the scores and divide by total the total number of entries to get the Average Point Score (APS) for Part II.

2. Multiply the resulting average rating by 30% for Part II to get the Weighted Average Score (WAS) for peer.

4.5 Overall Rating

1. Using the Summary of Rating portion of PEF-1, indicate the Raters Weighted Average Scores for both Part I and Part II.

In cases when the employee-ratee has no subordinate rater/s, the corresponding weights assigned shall be divided equally between Supervisor Rater and the Self Rater. the following percentage weight shall be followed to get the WAS:

<image>table_6.png</image>

2. Add the Overall Weighted Average Scores for part I and Part II of each rater to get the Total Weighted Score.

3. Add all Overall Weighted Scores to get the Total Overall score or Final Numerical Performance Rating.

4. Add the rating for Intervening Task, if any.

5. Computation of the over-all score should be up to four (4) decimal places. (no rounding off)

6. Convert the Total Overall Score or Final Performance Numerical Rating to Adjectival Rating using the conversion table under Item VII - I.

5. Performance Evaluation Forms (PEFS)

The Agency HRMO sees to it that all officials and employees are properly oriented on how to accomplish the following performance evaluation forms:

PEF-1 - Performance Evaluation Form contains the work targets, accomplishments, ratings of Supervisor and Employee-Ratee on Part I and Part II and the Summary of Ratings showing the final performance numerical and adjectival ratings of the employee.

It also contains the signed agreement of the supervisor and the employee, PERC action and the comments and recommendations. PEF - l is the form used in all stages of the performance evaluation process.

PEF-2 - Subordinate Rater Form (SRF) consists of a set of questionnaires depicting the ratee's job accomplishment and demonstrated behavior affecting the employee's performance for the rating period as can be observed and verified by the subordinate rater.

PEF-3 - Peer Rater Form (PRF) consists of questionnaires depicting the ratee's job accomplishment and demonstrated behavior as observed by the Peer Rater affecting the Peer Ratee's performance for the rating period.

VIII. SUBMISSION OF PERFORMANCE TARGETS, STANDARDS AND RATINGS

Performance targets of employees are submitted to the PERC not later than fifteen (15) days before the start of the rating period. The PERC shall have confirmed these targets not later than the 15th day of the start of each rating period. Failure on the part of the PBRC to act on these targets on the above period means that they are automatically confirmed.

Performance standards are submitted in the same period together with the performance targets.

Accomplished Performance Evaluation Forms (PEFs) with the final ratings are submitted to the Agency HRMO/Personnel Office/Department not later than the 15th day after the end of the rating period. The HRMO/Personnel Office/Department shall consolidate all the employee ratings and prepare a report to the PERC containing the statistics on PEF submission, distribution of ratings and list of protested or appealed ratings, if any, including all documents relative thereto. It shall submit all the above documents to the PERC within 30 days after the end of each rating period.

Officials and employees who shall be on official travel, approved leave of absence, training or scholarship programs and who have already met the required minimum rating period of 90 days are required to submit their performance targets and accomplished Performance Evaluation Forms (PEFs) before they leave the office.

For purposes of performance-based personnel actions, employees who are not given ratings for a particular period shall use their performance ratings obtained in the preceding rating period. This provision, shall not, however, apply to those who are on vacation leave, even with an approved application.

The Agency shall submit to the Civil Service Commission Field Office a list of employees with their corresponding performance ratings not later than three (3) months after every rating period.

IX. SANCTIONS

Non-submission to the PERC of the performance targets within 15 days before the start of the rating period and the Performance Evaluation Forms (PEFs) within 30 days after the end of each rating period, unless justification for such has been accepted by the PERC, is a ground for:

1. Employees' disqualification for performance-based personnel actions which would require the rating for the given period such as promotion, training or scholarship grants, and productivity incentive bonus if the failure of the submission of the report form is the fault of the employees.

2. Employees who fail to rate themselves will not be given final ratings; and

3. An administrative sanction for violation of reasonable office rules and regulations and simple neglect of duty for the supervisors or employees responsible for the delay or non-submission of said performance targets and PEFs or both.

Administrative action is filed against an employee using the DOH PES to give undue advantage or disadvantage to the employees they rate.

Procedure of filing complaints and imposing administrative sanctions shall be in accordance with the CSC Uniform Rules in the Conduct of Administrative Investigation.

XI. USES OF PERFORMANCE RATINGS

1. Performance-based Security of Tenure

Security of tenure of those holding permanent appointments is not absolute but is based on performance. Employees who obtained Unsatisfactory ratings for two rating periods and Poor rating for one evaluating period may be dropped from the rolls.

2. Eligibility / Qualification for Performance-based A wards and Incentives

Grant of incentives like the productivity incentive bonus or other performance based incentives and awards shall likewise be based on the final ratings of employees as approved by the PERC. The PERC shall validate the Outstanding Performance ratings and may recommend concerned employees for performance-based awards.

3. Basis for Personnel Actions

Performance ratings shall be used as basis for promotion, training and scholarship grants and other personnel actions. Only employees with Outstanding and Very Satisfactory Performance ratings shall be considered for the above mentioned personnel actions and other related matters.

XII. TRANSPARENCY ON PERFORMANCE RATINGS

General information on the final rating of the employees or the number of the employees who got a particular rating (O, VS, S, US and Poor) per organizational unit shall be made known to both management and the rank and file employees, subject to the procedures set by the agency PERC.

XII. APPEALS

Employees who feel aggrieved or dissatisfied with their final performance ratings can file an appeal with the PERC within (15) days from the date of receipt of their PEF or after the appraisal discussion with his supervisor.

Employees however, are not allowed to protest the performance ratings of their co-employees. Ratings obtained by other employees can only be used as basis or reference for comparison in appealing one's performance ratings.

The PERC shall decide on the appeals within one (1) month from receipt. Appeals lodged with the PERC shall follow the hierarchical jurisdiction of various PERCs in the Agency. Decision of the provincial PERC is appealable to the Regional PERC then to the Central Office PERC. Decision of the Central Office PERC is appealable to the CSC Proper, only in exception cases.

XIII. EFFECTIVITY

The revised DOH-PES shall take effect upon approval of the Civil Service Commission.
