<subject>SUBJECT: Philippine National Standards on Ethnic Food Products</subject>

<body>
I. RATIONALE:

Ethnic Foods are food products that use indigenous raw materials, ingredients condiments, spices or blends of these; using methods of preparation and serving suggestions that produce distinct sensory properties associated with traditional recipes or cooking styles of a region or place of their origin. These can also be adapted from foreign culinary styles that are modified to suit local tastes.

Since these products are different from most common food commodities that other countries are familiar with. they are often evaluated based on existing standards set for products whose characteristics are closely associated with ethnic food products. This practice often leads to inconsistencies in the fair and objective evaluation of the quality and safety of ethnic food products. These inconsistencies contribute to contentious technical barriers to trade leading to poor acceptance and performance of ethnic food products in the export markets.

To address these problems, technical guidelines are provided for local processors to adopt to ensure the quality and safety of these food products. Likewise, these will allow leverage against technical barriers to trade in the liberalized global market, thus, ensuring better competitiveness and market acceptance of our ethnic food products. These standards are hereby promulgated in accordance with the provisions of:

(1) Section 3(a) and (b) and 26(a) of Republic Act 3720, the "Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act," as amended by Sections 4 and 19 of Executive Order 175 (An Act to Ensure the Safety and Purity of Foods and Cosmetics, and the Purity, Safety, Efficacy and Quality of Drugs and Devices Being Made Available to the Public, Vesting the Bureau of Food and Drugs with Authority to Administer and Enforce the Laws Pertaining Thereto, and for other Purposes); and,

(2) Republic Act 7394. The Consumer Act of the Philippines, "(1992) mandating the Department of Health to "adopt measures to ensure pure and safe supply of foods and establish standards and quality measures for food".

II. SCOPE

This standard prescribes quality requirements and specifications for ETHNIC FOOD PRODUCTS, specifically for 1.) Dry Base Mixes for Soups and Sauces, and 2.) Sweet Preserves.

III. GENERAL OBJECTIVES

1. To ensure food safety and harmonize with international food control laws, rules and regulations in ensuring better access to domestic and export markets.

2. To develop and promulgate standards for Ethnic Food Products in line with the government's efforts to upgrade the quality of such products in order to improve its acceptance in the export market.

3. To strengthen inter-agency linkages in order to maximize the use of Ethnic Food Products.

4. To promote the adoption of standards in cooperation with concerned government agencies.

IV. DEFINITION OF TERMS

Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP) is a quality assurance system aimed at ensuring that products are consistently manufactured, packed, repacked or held to a quality appropriate for the intended use. It is thus concerned with both manufacturing and quality control procedures.

Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Points (HACCP) is a preventive food quality management system, which identifies, evaluates and controls the hazards significant to food safety specific to a product.

Heat processed food is any food processed by heat to an extent, which results in a product that is safe and will not spoil under normally expected temperature of non-refrigerated storage and transportation.
