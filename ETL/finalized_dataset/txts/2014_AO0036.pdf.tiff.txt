<subject>SUBJECT: Supplemental guidelines to Administrative Order 2012-0012 to Strengthen the Role of the Bureau of Health Facilities and Services (BHFS) and DOH Regional Ofﬁces (ROS) in Licensing of Hospitals and Other Health Facilities </subject>
<body>

I. Background and Rationale 

Republic Act 4226 otherwise known as the Hospital Licensure Act mandated the Bureau of Medical Services, now known as the Bureau of Health Facilities and Services (BHFS), to act as the licensing agency of the country. This has been enforced through the implementation of the Executive Order No. 102, which redirects the functions and operations of the Department of Health and DOH Administrative Order No. 147 s. 2004, entitled Amending Administrative Order No. 70A, series 2002 re: Revised Rules and Regulations Governing The Registration, Licensure and Operation of Hospitals and Other Health Facilities in the Philippines, which state that the DOH, through BHFS, shall be the principal agency in ensuring equity, access and quality of health care services through policy formation, standards development and regulations. 

With the increasing number of hospitals, and subsequently other health facilities as well, being regulated, regulatory functions have been decentralized to the DOH Regional Ofﬁces (DOH-ROS), formerly Centers for Health Development (CHDs), through its Regulation, Licensing and Enforcement Division (RLED). Based on Administrative Order No. 2007-0021, which sets the standards for the Harmonization and Streamlining of the Licensure Systems (One— Stop-Shop System) for Hospitals, Section V.B enlists the procedural guidelines for the decentralization of the regulatory functions to the DOH-ROS. Furthermore, Section V.B.l.d clearly states that the BHFS, along with the Bureau of Health Devices and Technology (BHDT) and Bureau of Food and Drugs (BFAD), now Food and Drugs Administration (FDA), shall exercise oversight, supervisory and monitoring functions over the Regional Ofﬁces with regards to the regulation of hospitals, their ancillary and other facilities. Furthermore, Administrative Order No. 2012-0012, entitled Rules and Regulations Governing the New Classiﬁcation of Hospitals and Other Health Facilities in the Philippines has already set the standards of the new classiﬁcation of hospitals and other health facilities. In this policy, it was also stated that the BHFS and Regional Ofﬁces will work closely and reiterated the division of labor in terms of licensing of health facilities. 

Since 2012, the Department of Health has been ISO certiﬁed by the Certiﬁcation International Philippines, Inc. (CIPI) for the Health Systems Administration, which includes Health Regulation. This policy adheres to the idea of continuous quality improvement in the sector of health regulation, through activities that would make our requirements be more client- responsive in the course of enforcement of minimum standards for patient safety. 


Hence, this order is hereby created to strengthen the oversight functions of BHFS to ensure synchronization of the processes from the Central Ofﬁce to the Regional Ofﬁces, through their respective RLEDs. 

II. Objectives 

1. To strengthen the oversight function of the BHFS in ensuring equity, access and quality of health care services in the regions. 

2. To enforce harmonization of licensing and accreditation processes and procedures in the Central and Regional Ofﬁces of the Department.
