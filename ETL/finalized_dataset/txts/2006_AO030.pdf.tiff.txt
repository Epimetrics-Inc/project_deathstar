<subject>Subject: Guidelines for the issuance of the Need for Training
Certificate (NTC) by the Department at Health (DOH) under the Exchange Visitors Program (EVP).</subject>


<body>
I. Rationale

The Exchange Visitors Program (EVP) refers to the international exchange program administered by the United States of America to implement the Mutual Education and Cultural Exchange Act of i96i. The establishment and development at the Exchange Visitor Program (EVP) extends as far back as January i948, when the United States Congress passed the information and Education Exchange Act, also known as the Smith—Mundt Act. The law was intended to increase mutual understanding between the people of the United States and the people of other countries through an information service and educational exchange service. These exchanges are intended to assist in furthering the United States’ foreign policy objectives. The EVP thus became a mechanism where Filipinos gain additional knowledge and skills in the USA not only to enhance their personal growth and development but also to share the same with our nationals.

To effect the implementation of this mutual agreement, the EVP Committee was created through Administrative Order No. i971 dated April 3, l956. This issuance was replace by Administrative Order No. 242 otherwise known as ”Further Reconstituting the Exchange Visitors Program Committee and Redefining its Functions which was signed by former President Fidel Ramos in January i7, l996. ~ The Department at Health is one of the government agencies which composed the membership at the said committee.
