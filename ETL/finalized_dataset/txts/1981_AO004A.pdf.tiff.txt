Due to the lack of anesthesiologists in many district hospitals and even in a few provincial hospitals, emergency cases cannot be operated on. Consequently, surgical cases have to be referred to higher level hospitals with these skills with the attendant delay in the needed operations and treatment of patients.

1. That there is no anesthesiologist appointed in the hospital or if there is, the number of surgical cases require the services of an assistant who maybe a nurse-anesthetist;
2. That there is a surgeon who can perform surgical operations in the hospital;
3. That the prepared nurse-anesthetist should have adequate knowledge and experience of operating room techniques and surgical nursing;
4. That the nurse-anesthetist shall be supervised by the surgeon;
5. That the duration of the training course for nurse-anesthetists shall be from three to six months, after having successfully completed the requirements of the course.
6. That the venue of training shall be the Dr. Jose R. Reyes Memorial Hospital and Medical Center initially and other accredited hospitals later.
7. That the participant for training of nurse-anesthetist shall come from hospitals located in difficult/depressed areas.
8. The requests for training of nurse-anesthetists shall be recommended by the Chief of Hospital to the Regional Health Director to the Chief of Office of Health education and Personnel Training who shall make the corresponding arrangements with the Dr. Jose R.
