<subject>Subject: Guidelines in Achieving Desired Family Size through Accelerated and Sutained Reduction in Unmet Need for Modern Family Planning Methods </subject>



<body>
I. BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE 

According to the National Demographic Health Survey (NDHS) 2013, forty-three percent (43%) of women in the Philippines consider two children as the ideal family size,‘ while 28% prefer three children. The average wanted fertility rate is two but the actual total fertility rate is three children. This means that on average, Filipino couples have one child more than what was planned or wanted. The prevailing high fertility rate especially among poor women is due to the lack of access to modern family planning (MFP) services. It is estimated that 35% of women have unmet need for MFP. This is roughly equivalent to six million women with unmet need, of which two million are poor. 

The Responsible Parenthood and Reproductive Health Act of 2012 (RPRH Law) mandates the universal provision of reproductive health (RH) services including family planning (FP). This is to ensure that unmet need for MFP are met in order to prevent unplanned and mistimed pregnancies that are associated with higher risk of complications during pregnancy and childbirth as well as have long- term socio—economic implications. 

The Socio—economic agenda and Philippine Health Agenda (PHA) under the current administration includes, among others the strengthening of the RPRH Law, its implementing rules and regulations (IR) and corresponding Department of Health (DOH) policy issuances. 

The Executive Order (E0) No.12 on Attaining and Sustaining “Zero Unmet Need for Modern Family Planning”, signed by President Rodrigo Roa Duterte on January 9, 2017, recognizes the need to address the unmet needs for any modern method of contraception. Pursuant to this, the DOH as the lead agency in the implementation of the RPRH Law shall issue policies and guidelines to create a signiﬁcant impact in addressing the unmet need for MFP to help the poor and marginalized families achieve their desired family size. 

II. OBJECTIVE
