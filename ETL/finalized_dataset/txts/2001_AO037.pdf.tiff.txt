<subject>SUBJECT: Guidelines on the Operationalization of the Health Sector Reform Agenda Implementation Plan (HSRAIP) by all Bureaus, Programs, Offices, centers for Health Development and Attached Agencies of the Department of Health</subject>


<body>

I. BACKGROUND

The Health Sector reform Agenda (HSRA) provides the direction and environment that is conducive to the achievement of an improved health status for all Filipinos. An important consideration in the implementation of the HSRA is the interdependence and synchronization of the five reform areas: Health Financing, Hospital System, Local Health System, Public Health System and Health Regulations. The Health Sector Reform Agenda Implementation Plan (HSRAIP) outlines the activities and strategies to be undertaken over a four-year period, from 2001 up to 2004. The HSRAIP is a priority for investment in the Department.

The HSRAIP employs two key strategic actions to effect a sustained implementation of HSRA despite budget and political constraints. These two strategic actions are: a) Health Passport Initiative, and b) Integration of the 5 health reform areas in selected convergence sites. the Health Passport Initiative will showcase quality and accessible health services through the full insurance converage scheme of the National Health Insurance Corporation and the Local Government Units. The other strategy, is the selection of advance implementation sites that will be the convergence areas for implementation of an integrated and comprehensive package of reforms by the DOH, PHIC, and LGU, which will result in the following: increased health insurance coverage, access to equitable and cost-efficient public and private health care delivery; adequate supply of quality, safe and affordable medicines and medical equipment; and, sustained health financing participated in by all necessary stakeholders. Successful implementation in a coverage site should inspire other LGUs to demand for the implementation of HSRA within their jurisdictions.

Relative to the HSRA and its implementation strategies, the Department identiﬁed ﬁve (5) High Impact Public Health Programs that respond to the needs of the majority of the Filipinos especially, the poor. These programs also ensure the achievement of the National Objectives for Health. The 5 High Impact Programs are: National Tuberculosis Control Program, Control of Vector-borne Diseases, Vaccine Preventable Disease Control Program, Women’s Health Program, and Child Health Program. All these programs shall be integrated in the health beneﬁts package of the Health Passport holder.

II. HSRAIP THRUSTS

The reform agenda has ﬁve major components: a) public health reform, which aims to increase and secure the needed ﬁnancing for important public health programs such as TB, vector-borne diseases, vaccine preventable diseases, women’s health and child health; b) local health systems reform, whose main purpose is to restore the integrity of the district health ofﬁce system that was inadvertently fragmented by the devolution of health services to local government units; c) hospital reforms, which will improve the quality of services of government hospitals and promote their operational efﬁciency by granting them management and ﬁnancial autonomy; d) regulatory reforms, to improve quality and reduce the costs of health products, particularly those ofdrugs, devices and services; and e) health ﬁnancing reforms, to increase substantially the share of social health insurance and at the same time lower the proportion of individual out-of~pocket spending as sources of total expenditures.

The major efforts of the HSRAIP shall focus on the following:
- Expansion and effective coverage of public health programs
- Increase access, especially by the poor, to personal health services from public and private health care providers
- Improving systems for local health service delivery
- Reduce ﬁnancial burden on individual families through universal coverage of the NHIP
- Strengthen the regulatory mandate of the DOH to safeguard quality of pharmaceuticals, health devices and facilities

III. SCOPE AND COVERAGE

This Administrative Order shall apply to all ofﬁces within the DOH system, including all of its attached agencies. Also within the scope of this Order are ofﬁces and other instrumentalities such as personnel of local government units, partners or networks who have existing memoranda of agreement with DOH relative to the implementation of the Health. Sector ReformAgenda Implementation Plan in their respective areas of jurisdiction.

IV. OUTCOMES AND ACTIVITIES

Given the severe budget constraints faced by government and political disruptions that prevent sustained long term implementation efforts, it is unlikely that the HSRA can be fully implemented at a national scale within the short to medium term period. Hence, the HSRAIP necessitates the undertaking of activities ”that cut across various convergence and non-convergence sites.
