<subject>SUBJECT: Operational Guidelines in the implementation of the Doctors to the Barrios (DTTB) Program.</subject>

<body>

I. BACKGROUND

The Philippine Constitution of 1987 (sec. II, Article XIII) mandates the adoption of an integrated and comprehensive approach for health development through the Department of Health. In the light of the devolution under, Republic Act 7160, one of the responsibilities of DOH is the development of special health programs and projects.

In 1993, given the reality of inequitable quality health services in 271 doctorless municipalities the Department of Health created the Doctors to the Barrios Program.

The Community Health Service took charge of the Program in February 20, 1996 by virtue of Department Order No. 63 s. 1996. Recognizing the need to improve its operation, it was deemed necessary to have the implementing rules and regulations redesigned to assure a more effective and efficient health care delivery to deserving doctorless municipalities nationwide.

II. DEFINITION OF TERMS 

Doctors to the Barrios Program (DTTBP) - is the Program conceptualized by the Department of Health (DOH) in 1993 to address the problems of the doctorless municipalities by providing accessible and equitable health care delivery system in the marginalized communities nationwide by deploying competent, committed and community—based physicians in areas identified with the Local Government Units (LGUs).

Armed—Conflict Area - refers to an area with peace and order problem as certified by the Department of National Defense.

Remote / Hard-to-reach Area — refers to an area that has any of the following conditions: 

1. No roads or trails
2. No roads but trails only
3. Reached by hiking or by animal-drawn vehicle
4. Unpredictable and irregular schedule of transportation
