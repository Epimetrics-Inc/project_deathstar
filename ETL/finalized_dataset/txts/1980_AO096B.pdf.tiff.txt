<docnum>NO. 96-B s. 1980</docnum>

TO: Regional Health Directors, Provincial and City Health Officers, Chiefs of Hospitals under the Ministry of Health

<subject>SUBJECT: Regulations Governing the Residential Site of Chiefs of Hospitals Granted Quarters Allowances</subject>

<body>
In the last staff meeting of the Ministry, the practice of some chiefs of hospitals leaving their stations on Fridays to go home to their residence located in other provinces or municipalities was brought to the attention of the undersigned. Under these circumstances, their return to their places of assignment as soon as possible becomes problematical considering the distance involved and personal factors. Consequently, the management of their respective hospitals suffer greatly both operationally and technically resulting in poor medical service that gives rise to public complaints.

Accordingly, the following regulations are hereby issued in the interest of an effective, efficient and responsive hospital administration:

1. Chiefs of hospitals under the Ministry who are granted quarters allowance are required to reside within the same municipality or city preferably within the vicinity of the hospital premises where they are assigned.

2. Chiefs of hospitals shall be available for consultation even outside of their tour of duty.

3. Whenever chiefs of hospitals are authorized by the Minister of Health or the Regional Health Director to transact official business in the regional office or with the Central Headquarters Offices, a Physician-in-Charge shall always be designated to attend to routinary functions and clothed with adequate authority to respond to emergencies.

4. Those chiefs of hospitals with official quarters located beyond the limits prescribed above should take immediate steps to relocate their authorized quarters a month from the effectivity of this directive.

This Order takes effect September 1, 1980.
