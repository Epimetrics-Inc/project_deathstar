<subject>SUBJECT: Implementing Guidelines on Early Recognition, Prevention and Control of Malaria Epidemics</subject>

<body>


The Philippines was among the 96 member countries of the World Health Organization (WHO) which endorsed the New Global Malaria Control Strategy. This was adopted during the Ministerial Conference on Malaria in Amsterdam, Netherlands last October 1992. The essential elements of the Strategy include Early  Prevention and Control of Malaria Epidemics.

In response to this commitment, the Departinent of Health (DOH), through the Malaria Control Service (MCS), conducted a series of Consultative Meetings to come up with the implementing guidelines. The participants were the MCS Staff, the Malaria Coordinators, the Assistant Provincial Health Officers and the WHO Consultants.


1. DEFINITIONS


1.1 Early Recognition, Prevention and Control of Malaria Epidemic refer to the establishment of a system that will immediately recognize an impending malaria epidemic, institute the preventive measures, and/or carry out the control measures in case of malaria epidemics.


1.2 Malaria Epidemic is a situation where there is an incidence of new malaria cases in excess of the expected. The application of such definition to actual situations is not always straight-forward. Any transmission in a previously malaria-free area is obviously in excess  of the expected and constitutes an epidemic by the above definition, with the premise that, traditionally, small epidemics are usually called outbreaks.


1.3 Epidemic Potential is a situation wherein an area is vulnerable to malaria case upsurge due to causal factors such as climatic changes, ecological changes or socio-economic changes.


1.4 Malaria Suspect is a patient having fever that occurs daily or every other day, plus any one of the following signs and symptoms:

* chills/chilly sensation before or during fever 
* profuse sweating after fever 
* headache 
* enlarged spleen
* jaundice 
* anemia


2. OBJECTIVES


2.1 General:

2.1.1 To effectively recognize, prevent and manage, malaria epidemics.

2.1.2 To reduce malaria morbidity and mortality


2.2 Speciﬁc:

2.2.1 To develop an effective malaria surveillance system both in hospitals and in field health offices.

2.2.2 To develop a screening system for the institution of preventive measures in areas with high epidemic potential.

2.2.3 To provide a quick and organized response to malaria epidemics.


3. GUIDELINES


3.1 Forecasting and Early Detection of a Malaria Epidemic

3.1.1 All Rural Health Units, hospitals and microscopy centres in malaria-endemic municipalities shall serve as sentinel sites. 

3.1.2 The sources of information shall include:

a. at the Rural Health Unit, FHIS Weekly Notifiable Diseases Report (WNDR) from the different Barangay Health Stations

b. at the Hospital, the weekly admission and consultation reports

c. at the Malaria Microscopy Centers, the weekly confirmed malaria cases report.

3.1.3 Each Rural Health Unit, each Hospital and each Malaria Microscopy Center must consolidate its own report, plot this into graphs (to show the weekly line trends) which must then be posted in a prominent and visible location at the rural health unit, the hospital and the microscopy center as the case may be.

3.1.4 Any unusual increases noted in the number of malaria cases shall be describe in relation to its distribution according to time (compare to previous weeks), place (by sitios/barangays) and person (age, sex, groups), and referred for appropriate action to the following:

a. the Municipal Health Ofiice for the Rural Health Units reports
b. the Provincial Malaria Coordinator (PMC) for the reports from the hospitals and Malaria Microscopy Centers

3.1.5 The above tasks shall be the responsibility of the following:

a. the Public Health Nurse, at the Rural Health Unit
b. the Municipal Malaria Coordinator in the Hospital
c. the Medical Technologist or malaria microscopist at the Malaria Microscopy Center

3.1.6 The PMC should create a surveillance team comprised of the following:
* PMC 
* Epidemiology Ofﬁcer 
* Medical Technologist / Microscopist

3.1.7 The team shall meet once monthly to consolidate, analyze and interpret reports from the different provinces and submit, within (2) two weeks the same to the Office for Public Health Services.


3.2 Prevention of the Spread of Malaria Epidemics

3.2.1 The following should be done in Malaria—Epidemic Prone Areas (META) in the
event of an imminent epidemic.

3.2.1.1 Mass Blood Smear (MES) collection 
3.2.1.2 Immediate conﬁrmation and follow-up of cases
3.2.1.3 Insecticide-Treatment of mosquito nets 
3.2 1.4 Focal Spraying 
3.2.1.5 Stream Clearing 
3.2.1.6 Intensive IEC Campaign 

3.2.2 All cases should be given drug treatment and followed-up until clinically and/or microscopically found negative.

3.2.3 Continuous surveillance measures should be implemented for three (3) years.

3.2.4 The LGUs, in collaboration with the NGOs and with the technical assistance from the PMC, should contribute in terms of the IEC campaign and logistics support.


3.3 Control of Malaria Epidemics

3.3.1 During epidemics, the MCS may extend assistance, through the RFO, to the LGUs or may directly intercede upon the direction of the Secretary of Health through the Undersecretary for Public Health Services or upon the request of the local authorities concerned.

3.3.2 A horizontal and vertical networking should be established between the DOH and the LGUs and among the LGUs to guarantee a synchronized and coordinated efforts as provided for under Chapter 7, Section 28 (h) of the DOH-LGC Implementing Rules and Regulations. The provision states that “Upon absorption of personnel, assets and appropriations that corresponds to devolved health service delivery functions, the provinces, cities and municipalities shall assume primary responsibilities over the access to health facilities, services and personnel by the DOH for purposes of inter-agency coordination and maintenance of the vertical and horizontal networking and referral system between the DOH and the LGUs and among LGUs.

3.3.3 An Epidemic Team shall be formed at the provincial and municipal levels with the following functions:

3.3.3.1 Define the nature and extent of the epidemic
3.3.3.2 Mass Blood Survey (MBS) Collection
3.3.3.3 Early detection and treatment of all cases and referral of severe and complicated cases to the hospitals
3.3.3.4 Rapid recognition of treatment failure or drug resistance
3.3.3.5 Insecticide-Treatment of mosquito nets, House Spraying, Stream Clearing, Stream Seeding and other Vector Control Measures
3.3.3.6 Intensive IEC Campaign
3.3.3.7 Mass Drug Administration (MDA) for a period of 4 weeks
3.3.3.8 Surveillance activities for three (3) years
3.3.3.9 Meet monthly during this 3-year period to formulate plans, to evaluate reports and control measures and to define financial, manpower and logistics requirements
3.3.3.10 This team will be called upon during every malaria epidemic
         

Below is the Epidemic Management Flow Chart to serve as guide for the different health units.
