<subject>SUBJECT : BAN OF THE USE DIETHYLSTILBESTROL (DES)</subject>

<body>
Diethylstilbestrol is a hormonal compound, used to promote growth in livestock and poultry.

Diethylstilbestrol was permitted for use in animal feed with the proviso that it will do no harm to the animal and that no residue will show up in the meat at the time of slaughter.

However, it has been definitely established that DES residue is found in the liver of slaughtered animals fed or implanted with DES.

Diethylstilbestrol is a known carcinogen and in the interest of consumer protection, the following regulations are hereby promulgated:

1. The use of diethylstilbestrol (DES) in any form in livestock and poultry is hereby prohibited.

2. The production of DES premix is likewise prohibited.

3. Animals implanted with DES before June 30, 1973 may still be slaughter and marketed.

Products containing DES and not in accordance with this regulation shall be deemed adulterated within the meaning of Sec. 14 (a) 1 of the Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act (R.A. 3720).

This regulation shall take effect 30 days after publication in the Official Gazette.
