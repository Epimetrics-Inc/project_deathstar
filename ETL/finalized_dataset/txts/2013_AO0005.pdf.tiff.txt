<body>


I. RATIONALE 

Non-communicable diseases are the top causes of death worldwide, killing more than 36 million people in 2008. Cardiovascular diseases were responsible for 48% of these deaths, cancers 21%, chronic respiratory’diseases 12%, and diabetes 3% based on the World Health Organization report on Non-communicable Diseases Country Proﬁles 2011part. In the Philippines, cardiovascular diseases, cancers, chronic respiratory diseases and diabetes are among the top killers causing more than half of all deaths annually. Hypertension and diseases of the heart are among the ten leading causes of illnesses each year. These lifestyle related non-communicable diseases have common risk factors which are to a large extent related to unhealthy lifestyle particularly tobacco use, unhealthy diet, physical inactivity and alcohol use (National Objectives for Health 2005—2010). 

These evident data have pushed international organizations to take actions and drive the entire world to prevent these kinds of diseases, which are long in duration and generally slow in progression. Recognizing the urgency of the situation, the Department of Health (DOH) as-the principal health agency in the Philippines, took on the lead in making policies and programs that could lessen these cases. In April 14, 2011, Administrative Order No. 2011-0003 or the National Policy on Strengthening the Prevention and Control of Chronic Lifestyle Related Non Communicable Disease was issued. The Order states that the Department of Health shall provide leader-ship in addressing lifestyle related non-communicable diseases and institute measures in ensuring that the programs for prevention are met and implemented. Section XI, Item No. 5 states that the National Epidemiology Center and the Information Management Service shall establish and sustain public health and hOSpital surveillance systems including registries, for lifestyle-related diseases and other non-communicable diseases. 

On the other hand, in the Asia Paciﬁc Region, it is estimated that injuries caused about 2.7 million deaths in 2002, or over 7000 deaths daily, which constituted 52% of wOrldwide injury deaths. .111 response to the injury-related problems, the Department of Health has created Administrative Order No. 2007-0010, dated March 19, 2007, the National Policy on Violence and Injury Prevention. This established a national policy .and strategic framework for injury prevention activities for DOH and other government agencies, local government units, non—government organizations, communities and indiViduals. Related to injury is violence against women and children which is not merely a health concern and requires a whole range of medical, social, and non-medical interventions and services. Administrative Order No. LB, 3. 1997 established a Women and Children Protection Unit in All DOH Hospitals. Further, the DOH supports the program on persons with disabilities and has created Administrative Order N0.16-As.1999 which established the Guidelines on the issuance of Certiﬁcation of Disability to Persons with Disabilities. 



To make available the data on chronic non-communicable diseases, injury, violence and disabilities, the Uniﬁed Registry Systems were developed by the DOH. These are the Integrated Chronic Non-Communicable Diseases, Online National Electronic Injury Surveillance System, Philippine Registry for Persons with Disabilities, and Violence Against Women and Children Registry System. This Order mandates all government and private clinics and hospitals to submit reportable cases of chronic non-communicable diseases, injuries, violence, and disabilities to the DOH Information Management Service, and deﬁnes the implementing procedures and guidelines related thereto. 

II. DECLARATION OF POLICIES
