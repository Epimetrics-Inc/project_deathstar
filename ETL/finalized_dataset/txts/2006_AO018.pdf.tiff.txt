<subject>SUBJECT : Implementing Guidelines for the Philippine National Drug Formulary System</subject>

<body>
I RATIONALE

The 1987 Philippine Constitution mandates the right of every Filipino to health. The State, under Section II of Article XIII, shall adopt an "integrated and comprehensive approach to health development which shall endeavor to make essential goods, health and other social services acceptable to all the people at affordable cost".

The state policy enunciated in Article II, Section 15 of the 1987 Constitution, that "The State shall protect and promote the health of the people and instill health consciousness among them".

Republic Act (RA) No. 6675 known as the "Generics Act of 1988," prescribe that it is the policy of the State to "ensure the adequate supply of drugs with generic names at the lowest possible cost". Further, it is stated in section 4 (a) of the said law that "(i)n the promotion of the generic names for pharmaceutical products, special consideration shall be given to drugs and medicines which are included in the Essential Drugs List to be prepared within one hundred eighty (180) days from approval of this Act and updated quarterly by the Department of Health on the basis of health conditions obtaining in the Philippines as well as on internationally accepted criteria."

Executive Order No. 49 dated January 21, 1993 entitled "Directing the Mandatory Use of the Philippine National Formulary Volume I as the Basis for Procurement of Drug Products by the Government," strengthens the advocacy of the generics law by ensuring that only essential drugs identified in their generic names will be procured by all government institutions.

Administrative Order No. 163 s. 2002 entitled "Implementing Guidelines and Procedures in the Procurement and Requisition of Drugs and Medicines by the Department of Health pursuant to Executive Order No. 49 dated January 21, 1993," provided the procedural bases that ensure requisition of essential drugs by the Government sector and the decision system for the inclusion and deletion of drugs in the Philippine National Drug Formulary (PNDF).

The PNDF Volume I became the basis for claims reimbursements for drugs and medicines through the Philippine Health Insurance Corporation (PHIC) Board Resolution No. 265 dated July 15, 1999.

After reviewing the implementing policies and procedures that ensure the use of the PNDF and the instruments used for the drug inclusion in and deletion from the formulary, the Department of Health finds it necessary to revise the inputs, processes, and outputs of the PNDF, collectively referred to, thereafter, as the Philippine National Drug Formulary System (PNDFS).

II SCOPE

This Order shall be applicable to all Health Facilities/Units/Offices of the entire Government Sector insofar as drug procurements is concerned and shall be applicable to the entire Health Sector (Government and Private) insofar as PHIC claims for drug reimbursements is concerned.

III OBJECTIVES

This Order is formulated in order to:

A Provide systems and procedure for:

1 The selection of drugs to be included in or deleted from the Essential Drug List (EDL), also known as the Philippine National Drug Formulary (PNDF).

2 The development of a new format of the EDL and the PNDF that integrates all three volumes of the old PNDF: the EDL, the Essential Drugs Monograph and the Cross-Reference Index. The new format shall be called the PNDF Manual

B Identify the roles and responsibilities of various units of the Department of Health, and other stakeholders who are involved in the continuous development of the PNDF.

IV DEFINITION OF TERMS

A CORE or MAIN LIST - A list of drugs for the health care needs of the majority of the population; the listed drugs should therefore be made available at all times in adequate amounts and in appropriate dosage forms at the lowest possible cost. They are of utmost importance and are basic, indispensable, and necessary for the health needs of the population.

B COMPLEMENTARY LIST- A list of drugs for treating rare disorders or for use in exceptional circumstances; alternative drugs when drugs in the main list are known to be ineffective or inappropriate for a given individual, alternative drugs when drugs in the main list cannot be made available, drugs with special pharmacological properties.

V GENERAL GUIDELINES

A The PNDFS shall consist of the Formulary Study Group (FSG) in charge of producing the Formulary Manual (also called the PNDF Manual) using the Formulary Selection Algorithm.

B The Formulary Study Group shall consist of the following committees and council:

1 The Formulary Executive Council (FEC)
2 The Epidemiology Committees

a) The Clinical Epidemiology Sub-committee
b) The Public Health Sub-committee

3 The Pharmacology Committee

C The Formulary Selection Algorithm shall be a step-by-Step drug selection procedure to be employed in determining the drugs to be. included or deleted from the formulary.

1 Based on a continuing review of disease statistics-from public and private hospitals and from government health facilities, the Epidemiology Committees shall identify the diseases for which drugs need to be included in the formulary The selection of these diseases shall be based on their burden, i.e., their frequency and severity The frequency of disease shall be measured by their prevalence or incidence. On the other hand, their severity shall be determined by disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) or, in its absence, a consensus of experts.

2 The Clinical Epidemiology Sub-committee shall identify the diseases for clinics and hospitals, while the Public Health Sub-committee shall, similarly, identify the diseases for the DOH public health programs. The DOH, PHIC and other stakeholders may also, separately, propose diseases to the Epidemiology Committees for consideration.

3 The Epidemiology Committees shall determine the most cost-effective clinical or public health practice guidelines based on a systematic review of the medical literature. Specific criteria to be considered are listed in Section VI.B. below.

4 The acceptable Clinical Practice Guidelines shall determine the pharmacologic management of the high-burden diseases and, consequently, the drugs that need to be listed in the formulary. These drugs must be of acceptable safety and efficacy prior to consideration for inclusion.

5 The Pharmacology Committee shall evaluate the drugs identified by the Epidemiology Committees to be listed in the formulary. Its task is to assess these drugs for favorability of pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties.

6 The recommendations of the Epidemiology and Pharmacology Committees shall be sent to the FEC for review. The FEC shall approve or disapprove the recommendations based on a Consensus of the expert perspectives available on the Council.

7 If a drug is disapproved, the drug's proponent, who may be a member of the Epidemiology or Pharmacology Committees, the DOH National Drug Policy Program (NDPP), or the PHIC may file a written appeals with the Office of the Undersecretary for Health Regulations for consideration. The appeal letter should highlight areas that might have been failed to be considered by the FEC or new evidences not reflected in previous submissions. Otherwise, an appeal shall be dismissed in the absence of such conditions. A Task Force may be created by the Undersecretary of Health, "By Authority of The Secretary of Health," to validate, conduct review and provide recommendation on appeals. Appeals from other parties as described in this Order, e.g. LGUs and Private Sector proponents, Third Parties-NGOs, POs and the likes, shall be coursed through the NDPP.

8 The evidence tables, references, and reports of all the Committees shall be published on the DOH and PHIC websites.

D The PNDF Manual shall consist of Clinical and Public Health Practice Guidelines, the Essential Drug List, the Formulary, and the Cross-Reference index.

1 The Clinical and Public Health Practice Guidelines are the guidelines critically-appraised by the Epidemiology Committees for cost-effectiveness and recommended for use by clinicians and public health practitioners.

2 The Essential Drug List is a simple listing of the drugs needed for the high-burden diseases identified by the Epidemiology Committees as reflected in the Clinical and Public Health Practice Guidelines.

3 The Formulary makes up the main text of the PNDF Manual and, for each essential drug, provides information on use, dosage, adverse effects, contraindications, and warnings.

4 The Cross-Reference index is a guide to the names of the branded and generic products for each drug and to their comparative prices.

5 The previously-named PNDF Volumes 1-3 shall now be integrated in the Formulary Manual and shall cease to exist as independent publications.

E The PNDF Manual shall be published upon the recommendation of the Undersecretary of Health tor Regulations and the approval of the Secretary of Health in accordance with the prescribed timelines established in the Generics Law. The PHIC shall be responsible for cost of dissemination and publication of the PNDF Manual.

F The FSG shall be under the supervision and guidance of the Undersecretary of Health for Regulations. its structure and composition shall be determined by the Secretary of Health upon the recommendations of the Undersecretary for Regulations. All forms and formats, templates, and the algorithms for the decision-making process used by the FSG shall be standardized and shall be subject to the review and approval of the Undersecretary of Health for Regulations. Such shall be issued through supplemental issuances approved by the Undersecretary of Health for Regulations and stamped "By Authority of the Secretary of Health." The NDPP shall be the monitoring arm of the Undersecretary of Health for Regulations that would provide feedback and recommendation on the performance of the FSG.

G The PHIC, shall provide the necessary administrative and secretariat functions of the Epidemiology and Pharmacology Committees of the FSG. On the other hand, the National Drug Policy Program (NDPP) shall be the main organic unit of the DOH that shall provide the necessary administrative and secretariat functions to the FEC.

H BFAD shall provide the necessary technical inputs and essential data requirements, such as quality assurance data, relative availability of drugs in terms of inventory, prices, and market authorizations, to the FSG, to the PHIC, and to the NDPP.

I Only drugs reflected in the PNDF Manual shall be procured by the all government entities in accordance with Executive Order No. 49 s. 1993. However, exemptions may be granted upon submission of a written request with justification subject to the approval of the NDP Program Manager which is also embodied in the aforementioned issuance.

J Only drugs reflected In the PNDF Manual shall be considered for reimbursement or subsidy by the Philippine Health insurance Corporation (PHIC) for the entire Health Sector, Government and Private.

K The PNDF Manual shall be reviewed and updated regularly in accordance with established timelines as provided in the RA 6675.

L The Secretary of Health may authorize the procurement or acquisition of drugs not listed in the PNDF Manual in times of emergency or in support of health initiatives with strategic impact to the development of the country.

M All drug establishments in the Philippine market must have a copy of the PNDF Manual. It shall be a reference for the establishment's in-patient counseling and in giving consumer advice when information about essential drugs is demanded.

N Drugs withdrawn from the Philippine market due to safety reasons shall be deemed delisted from the PNDF Manual effective on the date of the order for withdrawal by the DOH and/or BFAD.

B Specific Guidelines for the Formulary Selection Algorithm

1 The FSG shall ensure that each drug that is to be considered for inclusion in the PNDF shall be initially assessed based on its safety, efficacy, quality, and purity.

a) The BFAD shall provide the necessary data inputs to the FSG to this effect, i.e., records of all drugs registered in the Philippine market or covered with a Certificate of Product Registration (CPR). The BFAD shall likewise provide data on whether the drug is already in the Philippine market or is still in the process of registration. in the event that the drug being assessed has failed to pass the selection criteria for safety, efficacy, quality, and purity, It shall not be included in the list. in case it is registered for market entry, its CPR shall be revoked; if its registration is still under process, its application for CPR shall be denied. The FSG may recommend to the Secretary of Health the revocation of an existing CPR or denial of application of CPR. Such recommendation to the Secretary of Health (SOH), through the Undersecretary for Regulation, if approved, shall be enforced by the BFAD.

b) A life-saving essential drug which is not currently covered with a CPR or is not available in the local market may still be considered for inclusion in the PNDF provided that it has passed the selection conditions for the Core List. Still, the WHO Certification Scheme for the said drug and the relevant literature that would satisfy the selection criteria for safety, efficacy, quality, and purity must be obtained by the FSG. Said literature must come from the Drug Regulatory Agency of the country where the drug is marketed, and must be screened, cleared and deemed acceptable by BFAD, otherwise such drug shall not be included in the PNDF.

2 The FSG, on its own initiative, shall review the list of drugs reflected in the current essential drug list as embodied in the latest edition of the PNDF Manual during every quarter of the year. At least two (2) weeks before the end of each quarter the FSG shall submit the recommended drugs that are for inclusion or deletion from the latest edition of the PNDF Manual to the Undersecretary of Health for Regulations through the Program Manager of the NDPP. Such shall be published in the DOH and PHIC websites, upon the approval of the Secretary of Health, in the month succeeding the end of each quarter.

3 The following guidelines for drug selection shall be used by:

a) The Epidemiology sub-committees

i) Burden of disease-indicated in the prevalence or incidence of disease and its DALY.

ii) Efficacy and safety-based on objective results and on adequate pharmacological studies including at least expanded Phase II clinical trials and/or additional Phase III studies.

iii) Pharmacoeconomic analysis of drug therapy/ treatment regimen-the pharmacoeconomic analysis of drug therapy/ treatment regimen considering not only therapeutic effects but also adverse events and based on quality economic evaluations (e.g. use of pharmacoeconomic tools such as cost benefit analysis, cost effectiveness, cost utility, etc).

iv) Appropriateness to the capability of health workers at different levels of health care-the level of expertise required for prescribing, for administering, and for monitoring the safety and adverse effects of single drugs or group of drugs in a therapeutic category must be considered. Consideration should be given to the competence of local personnel in making a correct diagnosis.

b) The Pharmacology sub-committee

i) Local health problems-The influence of concomitant or prevalent diseases or conditions on pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic parameters and on the modification of the therapeutic response have to be considered in making a selection, e.g., malnutrition, liver disease.

ii) Benefit/Risk ratio--when several comparable drugs are available for the same therapeutic indication, it is necessary to select the one which provides the most favorable benefit/risk ratio.

4 Preferential factors for evaluating therapeutically-equivalent drugs, both the Epidemiology Committees and the Pharmacology Committee should use these guidelines in choosing the best drug:

a) The drug most thoroughly investigated, with extensive clinical experience and therefore the best understood with respect to its beneficial properties and limitations.

b) The drug possessing clinical utility for the treatment of more than one condition or disease.

c) The drug with most favorable pharmacokinetic properties, e.g., better compliance or lesser risk in various pathophysiological states.

d) The drugs that are in dosage forms that are easy for the health staff to dispense or are easily or safely administered to the patient.

e) The drugs that are easy for the patient to take or have greater acceptability among most patients.

f) The drugs, pharmaceutical products, and dosage forms with favorable stability under the anticipated local conditions in storage facilities.

g) The drugs for which local, reliable manufacturing facilities exist for their production.

5 In the great majority of cases, the drugs should be formulated as single compounds-Fixed-ratio combinations are only acceptable when:

a) The value of concomitant use of more than one drug is clinically documented.

b) The therapeutic benefit of the combination is greater than the sum of each of the individual components.

c) The combination is safer than the use of an individual drug.

d) The cost of the combination product is less than or should not exceed the cost of the sum of the individual products.

e) Compliance is improved.

f) The combination must be such that the appropriate drug benefit-to-risk ratio satisfactory for the majority of the population is maintained.

6 As a result of the above guidelines, the criteria for inclusion of drugs in the PNDF are as follows:

a) The drug is needed for the prevention and treatment of conditions not already covered in the existing list;

b) The drug is more effective and/or less toxic than a drug listed for the same indication;

c) The drug is economically dominant, i.e., more effective and safe and of lower cost than the drug listed for the same indication; and

d) The drug is deemed essential for a specific DOH health program/project.

7 Similarly, the criteria for the deletion of drugs in the PNDF are as follows:

a) A more effective or equally effective but less toxic drug becomes available;

b) In the light of further knowledge, the therapeutic efficacy of the drug is found to be unsatisfactory or questionable;

c) Toxicity, suspected toxicity, potential for abuse, dangerous interactions outweigh the drug's therapeutic value;

d) The drug has fallen into disuse and is no longer available;

e) The drug is no longer deemed cost-effective compared to other therapies;

f) The drug is a fixed-dose combination that does not satisfy the requirements of A.O. 96 s.1990.

8 The following criteria shall be used in selecting drugs for inclusion in the Core List of the PNDF:

a) The drug has an acceptable safety profile, proven efficacy, good quality and purity

b) Disease or condition for which the drug is indicated is found in the Philippines

i) The drug is life-saving even if the disease or condition for which the drug is indicated is of low prevalence OR

ii) The disease or condition for which the drug is indicated is of high prevalence AND there is no other therapeutically-equivalent drugs available in the PNDF OR

iii) The disease or condition for which the drug is indicated is of high prevalence, there are two or more therapeutically-equivalent drugs available in the PNDF, BUT:

(a) It has a favorable benefit-risk ratio

(b) it has been thoroughly investigated or there has been extensive local clinical experience

(c) it has favorable pharmacokinetic properties, e.g., improved compliance or is easy to administer

(d) it is stable under anticipated local conditions, i.e., favorable data on accelerated and long-term studies

(e) it is cost-effective and/or has reliable local manufacturing facilities.

9 The following criteria shall be used in selecting drugs for inclusion in the Complementary List of the PNDF:

a) The disease or condition for which the drug is indicated is of low prevalence AND the drug is not life-saving OR

b) There is a high prevalence of the disease or condition for which the drug is indicated, there are two or more therapeutically-equivalent drugs available in the PNDF, the drug has a favorable benefit/risk ratio, BUT

i) it has not been thoroughly investigated or there has not been extensive clinical experience OR

ii) it does not have favorable pharmacokinetic properties, e.g., has poor compliance or is difficult to administer OR

iii) it is not stable under anticipated local conditions, i.e., unfavorable data on accelerated and long-term studies OR

iv) it is not cost-effective and/or has no reliable local manufacturing facilities BUT is needed

10 The use of the selection criteria above is further described and explained by the algorithm in Annex G.

11 After review by both the appropriate Epidemiology Committees and the Pharmacology Committee using the above selection criteria, the Drug Selection Form-FSG-initiated is sent to the FEC for approval. Using the broad societal perspectives represented by its members, the FEC approves or disapproves the submitted recommendations by majority vote.

ANNOTATIONS

A Some drugs of proven efficacy and safety are not available in the market for lack of profitability or perceived demand but are considered essential, hence included in the PNDF marketed with asterisk.

B Systematic literature reviews in which studies are systematically searched, assembled, appraised and summarized using explicit and reproducible approaches that minimizes biases and random errors (after Sacks, Chalmers, Smith. Randomized versus historical controls for clinical trials. Am J Med 1982; 72:233-40.). The steps that the National Formulary Committee take in conducting systematic literature reviews on specific drugs are the following:

1. We pose the question: Is drug X a safe and efficacious drug for condition Y?

2. We conduct a comprehensive search for randomized controlled trials in HERDIN, MEDLINE, EMBASE, the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register in the Cochrane Library. We combine the generic name of the drug and the MESH terms of the indications for its use with the optimum set of keywords and commands for locating RCTs as given in the Cochrane Handbook for Preparing Systematic Reviews. We search for systematic reviews. in the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews using the genetic name of the drug as keyword.

3. We evaluate the abstracts of the studies to verify whether they are really RCTs or not and their relevance to our question.

4. We extract data on safety and efficacy from the study abstracts or, if needed, from the full texts. 

5. We summarize the results of each study in an evidence table and examine similarities and differences of finding across studies. if appropriate, meta-analyses are performed to quantitatively combine the results of several studies.

C Benefits are expressed in risk differences and/or numbers needed to treat (NNT). We define risk as the proportion of people who develop a bad event among all of those who are at risk for developing it. The efficacy of drug X is reflected by the size of the difference in the risk of developing a bad event with and without drug X (the absolute risk difference or ARR). Alternatively, the number of people who need to be treated with drug X to prevent one bad event (the NNT) may be obtained by the formula NNT = 1/ARR such that the smaller the, NNT the more efficacious the drug. Safety is inversely proportional to the risk for adverse effects and is similarly expressed in risk differences and/or numbers needed to harm (NNH). Thus, as the risk difference rises or the NNH decreases the drug is deemed less and less safe.

D1 Recently completed RCTs or systematic reviews that show new drugs to be more efficacious or safe (see C for definitions of efficacy and safety) than other drugs in the same class may be grounds for their inclusion in lieu of or as a complement to formulary drugs. However, the NFC may choose to perform a cost-effectiveness analysis when newer, more efficacious drugs are more expensive than formulary drugs.

D2 The bases for deletion include the following: (1) recently completed RCTs or systematic reviews that show formulary drugs to be less efficacious or safe (see C for definitions of efficacy and safety) than other drugs in the same class; (2) cost-effectiveness analysis favors newer drugs of the same therapeutic class as the formulary drugs.
