I. BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE 

Pursuant to Executive Order No. 159, all departments, bureaus, offices, units and agencies of the National Government, including government—owned or controlled corporations are directed in revise their fees and charges at just and reasonable rates sufﬁcient to reeever at least the fill cost of services rendered. Only few government agencies however, complied with the directive. 

Consequently, on January 13, 2000, Executive Order No. 197 was approved and issued. The Executive Order directs all departments, bureaus, commissions, agencies, ofﬁces and instrumentalities of the National Government, including government-owned or controlled corporations to increase their rates of fees and charges by not less than twenty-percent. 

Pursuant to Executive Order No] 197, the Department of Health issued Administrative Order No. 40 series of 2000 revising the fees and charges for the corresponding services rendered by the Bureau of Licensing and Regulation now known as the Bureau of Heaith Facilities and Services, the former Bureau of Research and Laboratories, Bureau of Food and Drugs presently known as the Food and Drug Administration and the National Quarantine Ofﬁce or the Bureau of Quarantine. The said Administrative Order was amended by AD. No. 104-A ' series of 2000 which took effect on October 16, 2000. Nevertheless, the then National Quarantine Office made an amendments of its fees and charges. 

In 2004, Republic Act 9271 otherwise known as the Quarantine Act of 2004 was passed. Section 9 of the said R. A. authorizes the Bureau of Quarantine formerly known as the National Quarantine Ofﬁce to use at least ﬁfty percent of its generated income subject to accounting and auditing rules and regulations. The income retained by the Bureau, according to its Implementing Rules and Regulations shall be used for capital outlay and maintenance and ether seperating expenses. 

In 2005, the Bureau conducted a review of its current fees and charges for services being rendered. This led to the issuance of Administrative Order No. 2005-0019 amending A.O. No. 104-A series of 2000 which increases the vaccination fee for yellow fever. 

 
Another review of fees and charges imposed by the Bureau was done in 2006, The analysis showed that the present fees and charges collected fall below the incurred operational cost. Thus, Administrative Order No. 2006-0010 was issued which revises the fees and charges enforced by the Bureau. ' 

In 2010, another assessment of the current fees and charges showed that what is being collected for the respective services rendered fall below the incurred operational cost. Local and foreign comparative studies done further illustrates that the Bureau has the lowest fees and charges currently imposed. With the continuous global increase in the prices of commodities such as vaccines, supplies and other logistics and services such as insurance, airfreight, and service charge for imported commodities and added to these the incessant increase in the cost of utilities which are immensely required to maintain the efficacy of vaccines and other equipment needed for certain services, there is a need to further increase some of the current fees and charges to defray the cost of operational expenses, incidental to the continuous delivery of the mandated services of the Bureau of Quarantine as well as its maintenance.
