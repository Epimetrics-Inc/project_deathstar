<body>

A. RATIONALE 

The Aquino Health Agenda (AHA): Achieving Universal Health Care for All Filipinos embodied in Administrative Order No. 2010-0036, dated December 16, 2010 states that poor Filipino families “have yet to experience equity and access to critical health services.” AO. 2010- 0036 further recognizes that the public hospitals and health facilities have suffered neglect due to the inadequacy of health budgets 111 terms of support for upgrading to expand capacity and improve quality of services. 

AHA also states “the poorest of the population are the main users of government health facilities. This means that the deterioration and poor quality of many government health facilities is particularly disadvantageous to the poor who needs the services the most.” 

In 1997, Administrative Order l—B or the “Establishment of a Women and Children Protection Unit in All Department of Health (DOH) Hospitals” was promulgated in response to the increasing number of women and children who consult due to violence, rape, incest, and other related cases. 

For the past years, there have been attempts to increase the number of WCPUs especially in DOE-retained hospitals but they have been unsuccessful for many reasons. 

The experiences of these 38 women and children protection units (WCPUS) reflect that: over the-last 7 years from 2004 to 2010, all these WCPUs handled an average of 6,224 new cases with a mean increase of 156 percent. The 2010 statistics presented a record high of 12,787 new cases and an average of 79.86 percent increase from 2009. More than .59 percent were cases of sexual abuse; more than 37 percent Were physical abuse and the rest on neglect, combined sexual and physical abuse and minor perpetrators. More than 50 percent of these - new cases were ' obtained from WCPUs based in highly urbanized areas across the country. 

Figures show there is a need to continue to raise awareness on domestic violence to have more accurate recording and reporting; 

- The source of budget cited in AO.1-B is subjected to multiple interpretations and is dependent on the priorities of the local chief executive and/or the healthcare facility management; 
- Doctors and social workers hesitate to take on the task due to heavy workload of child protection work, lack of training and feelings of inadequacy, considering the nature of work, which among others requires responding to subpoenas and appearing in court; ' 

This Administrative Order supports the Government Health Sector Reform Agenda, the  Convention on the Rights of the Child, the Convention on the Elimination cf All Forms of Discrimination Against Women, the Beijing Platform for Action, the Child Protection Law, the Anti-Violence againstWomen and Their Children’s Act of 2004, the Anti—Rape Act of 1998, the Rape Victim Assistance and Protection Act of 1998, and the Magna Carta of Women of 2009.
