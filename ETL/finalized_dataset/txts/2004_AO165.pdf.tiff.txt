<subject>I. TITLE Interim Guidelines in Surveillance of Avian Influenza (Bird Flu) in Humans in the Philippines</subject>

<body>

II. RATIONALE/BACKGROUND

Avian influenza (or avian flu or bird flu) is an infectious disease caused by influenza virus A affecting both domestic (poultry) and wild (migratory) birds Wild birds are the primary natural reservoir. Highly pathogenic avian influenza or HPAI (those of H5 and H7 subtypes) causes severe illness in chickens, turkeys and guinea fowl and is highly fatal. This disease affects the respiratory, digestive and nervous systems of sick animals. Virus is shed in oro-nasal secretions as well as feces of sick birds. Since December 2003. Influenza A/H5N1 outbreaks have occurred in South Korea, Japan, Vietnam, Cambodia, Thailand and Indonesia. Millions of chickens died or have been killed to prevent further spread. Epidemics in animals, if not controlled properly, last for years.

The avian influenza virus could be transmitted from sick poultry to humans. The first reported human outbreak of HPAI (HSNI) was in Hong Kong last 1997. It caused severe reSpiratory disease in 18 persons with 6 deaths. In February 2003, Hong Kong had 2 HPAI cases with 1 death. In Netherlands, H7N7 bird flu caused 83 cases with mild illness and l death. In Hong Kong, H9N2 downed 2 persons in 1999 and in December 2003. As of March 10 this year, Vietnam had reported 18 confirmed cases and 13 deaths (case fatality ratio [CFR] of 72%) while Thailand had confirmed 11 cases with 7 deaths (CFR 64%).

The signs and symptoms of HPAI or Influenza A/H5 in humans are similar to human influenza.These are fever, cough, sore throat  and body malaise. However, complications are sudden and severe like pneumonia and encephalitis. Fortunately, recent studies suggest that antiviral agents against human influenza would be effective in treating avian influenza in humans.

Although there are no reported animal or human cases of bird flu in the Philippines, its unprecedented spread among our  neighboring countries threatens our poultry industry and our people's health. Absence of specific human vaccine for influenza A/H5 or HPAI, the very little human immune protection for it and its possible re-assortment in humans, thereby, facilitating human-to-human transmission that may lead to pandemic, pose risks on our countrymen. In line with this, Executive Order 280 was issued by the President activating a crisis management system in response to avian flu.

The ability to undergo frequent and permanent antigenic changes of HPAI requires regular monitoring to make adjustments in the development of human vaccines. Also, it is imperative that avian influenza in humans be promptly identified and reported for timely management. This, along with appropriate control and preventive measures, will halt the disease's spread. Hence, the following guidelines are issued for surveillance of human cases of avian influenza in the country.

III. COVERAGE/SCOPE

This set of guidelines will be implemented by both local and national health offices as well as its respective health facilities.

IV. OBJECTIVES

A. General

To establish guidelines for an early warning system for detection of avian influenza HS or H7 among humans for provision of information and support to both local and international influenza networks

B. Specific

1. To establish an Avian Influenza (Bird Flu) case registry that shall include case classification and patient profile/history (socio-demographics, illness and contact history, vaccination, treatment, and laboratory analyses done)

2. To establish a reporting system that could provide information on the circulating strains, antigenic variants and seasonal trends of suspect avian influenza cases locally

3. To provide data that would ensure prompt case management of identified and confirmed avian influenza and prompt provision of preventive measures to individuals belonging to high-risk groups (see TARGET RISK GROUPS)

V. GENERAL MANDATE

In line with Executive Order No. 280 Defining the Powers, Functions and Responsibilities of Government Agencies in Response to Avian Influenza (AI) or Bird Flu Virus and related Matters Thereto signed February 5, 2004, the Department of Health through the Secretary of Health is hereby granted and bestowed such powers and authority as would be necessary in order to prevent, restrict or otherwise regulate the entry, or surveillance of people coming from infected countries or in any instance where the highly pathogenic avian influenza has infected, or suspected to have infected, humans. The establishment of avian influenza surveillance system is necessary to execute the above mandate.

VI. IMPLEMENTING MECHANISMS

A. SYSTEMS AND PROCEDURES

1. Establishing Surveillance System

Surveillance is the cornerstone for pandemic preparedness and response. Therefore, establishing surveillance system for avian flu in the country is essential. However, there is already an existing surveillance system for diseases of epidemic potential at NEC, RITM and RESU. With such infrastructure and capacities for conducting surveillance, we can build an integrated surveillance system in to this existing one.

a. Case Definitions

<image>table_1a.png</image>
<image>table_1b.png</image>

b. Target Areas

Philippines' 14 Wetlands and 2 Dams that serve as sanctuaries for migratory ducks including the areas within the 3 km. radius from the edge of the above sanctuaries as identified by Department of Environment and Natural Resources (DENR) will be the target areas of the Avian Influenza surveillance. Regions and provinces must coordinate with regional / provincial DENR  office to get the specific areas for surveillance under their jurisdiction.

c. Target Risk Groups

1) Poultry Workers (either residents or employees) in

a) Layers/Breeders/Gamefowl/Broiler Farms in areas within the 3 km. radius from 14 sanctuaries' edges
b) Backyard Farms for Native and other Types of Chicken within the 3 km. radius from 14 sanctuaries' edges

2) Protected Areas and Wildlife Bureau Workers working in the 14 sanctuaries where migratory ducks feed and breed
3) Residents within the 14 sanctuaries where migratory ducks feed and breed
4) Residents in "sitios" within the 3 km radius from the 14 sanctuaries' edges
5) Residents of avian influenza (AI) affected areas as declared by BAI

d. Sentinel Sites

1) Industrial Clinics for Poultry Workers of Poultry Farms within the 3 km. radius from the 14 sanctuaries' edges where migratory ducks feed and breed

2) Hospitals where the residents (within the sanctuary and up to the border of the 3 km radius from the 14 sanctuaries' edge) consult

3) Rural Health Units where the residents (within the sanctuary and up to the border of the 3 km radius from the 14 sanctuaries' edge) consult

4) Other hospitals and institutions not included in 4a, 4b, and 4c as well as in the target areas

e. Selected Indicators

1) Number of identified cases per classification

2) Frequencies and proportions of cases as to age, gender, occupation, residence and facility where the cases consulted

3) Frequencies and proportions of cases as to onset of illness, consultation date, duration of illness and presence of signs and symptoms pertaining to influenza

4) Frequencies and proportions of cases as to vaccination status to influenza, medicines instituted, contact status, circulating strains isolated and antigenic variants identified

2. Specific Procedures (see Annex A. Operational Flowchart)

a. Case Reporting, Investigation and Decision-Making

All patients who consulted the sentinel sites must be provided with Bird Flu information which contains the ff: basic data on bird flu, warning of danger to contacts, things to do when signs and symptoms develop, and hotlines wherein they could get in touch for further information.

ILI-SS cases consulting at sentinel sites will be declared suspect Influenza AIHS cases if epidemiological linkage for avian influenza has been established (see Suspect Case Definition). The following will be the procedures once suspect Influenza A/HS case is identified;

1) Attending doctor or trained staff fills up case investigation form (see attached form) and obtains oropharyngeal swabs (see attached guide on Specimen collection) from the cases. Staff must use prOper personnel protective equipment (PPE) and practice universal infection precautions (UIP).

2) Sentinel site sends laboratory form and properly-packed specimens directly to the Research Institute of Tropical Medicine (RITM) in Alabang, Muntinlupa and provides copies of case investigation forms to the provincial health office (PHO), Regional Epidemiology and Surveillance Units (RESUS), National Epidemiology Center (NEC)-Department of Health, and RITM.

3) RITM informs RHU, PHO, RESUs and NEC that they had received the Specimens, processes them and immediately reports the results back these offices. If the result/s are positive for bird flu, NEC and RITM informs the Epidemiology and Surveillance Subcommittee (ESSC) of the DOH Task Force on Avian Influenza which in turn, informs the CRISIS MANAGER and the Task Force on Bird Flu of the situation.

4) The CRISIS MANAGER informs the President and other government agencies of the situation thru the Task Force Secretariat. The said area will be quarantined in accordance with the Task Force recommendation.

5) All ILI-SS cases without epidemiologic linkage will be treated accordingly and sent home where they will monitor their symptoms for 7 days. If they develop fever during those 7 days, he is advised to return to the sentinel site for reassessment. If he has no fever during the 7-day observation period, he will be classified as non-influenza case.

b. Data Management

1) Data Depository

a) NEC-Surveillance Section - national epidemiologic data depository for bird flu cases
b) CHD-RESU - respective regional epidemiologic data depository for bird flu cases
c) RITM - Virology Department (WHO Influenza Network designate as Philippine Influenza Center) - national lab data depository for bird flu cases

2) Data Encoding

All submitted case investigation forms to NEC and the involved RES Us shall be
encoded using the EPI INFO software.-

3) Data Provision
The above offices shall release information pertaining to bird flu cases and situation
ONLY upon the directive of the Secretary of Health who is the CRISIS MANAGER.

B. ROLES AND RESPONSIBILITIES

1. National Level
The Department of Health, through the agencies below, shall do the following:

a. National Epidemiology Center (NEC)

GUIDE TO COLLECTION, HANDLING AND TRANSPORT OF SPECIMENS FOR INFLUENZA INVESTIGATION REFERRED TO THE RESEARCH INSTITUTE FOR TROPICAL MEDICINE

General Instructions:
1. Only specimens from patients that meet the Influenza/Avian Case Definition should be referred for confirmation.
2. Observe the "Standard Precautions" for the collection, handling and transport of specimens at all times.
3. Collection of respiratory specimen(s) and paired blood samples are recommended.
4. All specimens should be accompanied by a completely and legibly filled up Influenza Case Investigation and Laboratory Request Form. Otherwise, tests may not be performed or results held unnecessarily.

A. RESPIRATORY SPECIMENS - for Virus Isolation, Antigen Detection and/or RT-PCR. Nasopharyngeal Aspirate is the most appropriate specimen for direct antigen detection; Collection of both Oropharyngeal and Nasopharyngeal Swabs is recommended.

1. Timing of Collection - collect as soon as possible up to 5 days from the onset of illness.
2. Procedure of Collection:

• Nasopharyngeal Aspirate (NPA) - Have the patient sit with the head tilted slightly backward. Instill 1.5 ml sterile saline (pH 7.0) into one nostril. Flush the tubings of the mucus trap with 2-3 mls of saline. Insert the tubing into the nostril parallel to the palate. Aspirate nasopharyngeal secretions by gentle suction into the attached receptacle. Repeat this procedure on the other nostril. Remove tubings and discard in a plastic bag. Cover and label the receptacle. Place in a plastic bag.

• Oropharyngeal Swabs -Use only Dacron or Rayon-tip swabs with plastic shaft. Do not use cotton swabs with wooden shaft as this will inactivate some viruses and inhibit PCR testing. Swab both posterior pharynx and deep inside the throat, i.e. tonsillar crypts, inner walls, sides, etc., avoiding the tongue. Apply a little force, taking large quantities of mucosal cells as viruses are intracellular.

• Nasopharyngeal swabs - Use only Dacron or Rayon-tip swabs with plastic shaft. Insert swab into the nostril parallel to the palate and leave in place for a few seconds to absorb enough secretions. Swab both nostrils.

3. Procedure for handling and labeling specimens after collection:

3.1. Place each swab immediately in a tube containing Virus Transport Media (VTM). This is available at the RITM Virology Department and RESUs. Do not allow the swabs to dry.

3.2. Break the end of the swab that sticks our of the tube and close the tube tightly. Secure the cap with parafilm to prevent leakage during transport.

3.3. Label the specimen container with the Patient's Full Name, age, sex and date of collection. The information on the label must be legible and should match the information on the Influenza Case Investigation and Laboratory Request Form. Labels must remain attached under all conditions of storage and transport.

3.4. Place the specimens in a plastic bag.

3.5. Keep the specimens refrigerated while awaiting transport.

B. BLOOD SPECIMENS - for antibody detection. Collect both acute and convalescent samples. Only paired specimens will be tested. Blood specimens will be stored until reagents are available.

1. Timing of collection - Collect an acute phase sample as soon as possible at first contact with the patient. Collect a convalescent phase sample 3 weeks after the collection of acute phase blood.

2. Procedure of Collection, handling and labeling:

2.1. Collect 5-10 ml of blood by venipuncture and allow to clot.

2.2. Centrifuge briefly to separate the serum.

2.3. Aseptically transfer serum, absolutely not less than 1.5 ml, into a sterile plastic vial with screw cap (preferably with O-ring and external thread, e.g. cryogenic vial).

2.4. Close tightly and secure the cap with parafilm to prevent leakage.

3. Procedure for handling and labeling of blood samples after collection:

3.1. Label the specimen container with the Patient's Full Name, age, sex and date of collection. The information on the label must be legible and should match the information on the Influenza Case Investigation and Laboratory Request Form. Labels must remain attached under all conditions of storage and transport.

3.2. Keep the acute serum refrigerated (or frozen at - 20 °C) while awaiting collection of the convalescent sample.

3.3. Keep the specimens refrigerated while awaiting transport.

C. TRANSPORT OF SPECIMENS TO RITM

1. Pack specimen container with tissue or any absorbent material enough to absorb contents in case of leakage or damage. Place in plastic bag.

2. Place in a Transport Box (Styropor, Coleman) containing at least 2-4 frozen ice packs to maintain the viability of the specimens. Keep the specimens in upright position.

3. Place the Influenza Case Investigation and Laboratory Request Form(s) in a separate plastic bag to prevent it from being contaminated. Place in Transport Box and submit together with the specimen(s).

Address shipment to:

VIROLOGY DEPARTMENT/INFLUENZA SURVEILLANCE
Research Institute for Tropical Medicine
Filinvest Corporate City Cpd.,
Alabang, Muntinlupa City

Attention: Dr. Fem Julia E. Paladin / Ms. Malet O. Rivera, RMT

5. Please inform the Virology Staff before making any shipment providing information on the origin, number of specimens, type of specimens, date of shipment, courier, contact person/name of sender and contact no. (preferably Cellphone No.). If possible, avoid arrivals during weekends or holidays.
