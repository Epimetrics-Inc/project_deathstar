<subject>SUBJECT: Implementing Guidelines for Institutionalizing the Estimation and Use of Local Health Accounts (LHA)</subject> 

<body>
I. Rationale 

The National Health Accounts or NHA is a system for examining and comprehensively estimating an entire country’s expenditures for health in a given period of time. The Philippine National Health Account (PNHA) provides the estimate of health expenditure for the Philippine Health Sector and tells us where money for health comes-from and where it is being spent. It is an important tool in planning, budgeting and policy development in the country, especially in the health sector. Beginning 1994, the National Statistical Coordination Board (N SCB) regularly produces and publishes the PNHA with data aggregates from the national level.  

The Local Health Accounts (LHA) is a subset or component of the National Health Accounts; therefore, it basically follows the concepts, deﬁnitions and methods used in the NHA. In the same way, the LHA is a system for examining and comprehensively estimating expenditures for health but for a speciﬁc deﬁned sub-national geographic unit or a deﬁned local area of the country, such as the province. 

Because of the changes in the health sector brought about by devolution, the need to properly manage health sector resources at the local level increasingly became an important concern. It is recognized that a necessary input to effective local governance, particularly on health resource management, is comprehensive information on the local health sector ﬁnancial situation - information that can be provided by estimating LHA. 

Further, data from local health accounts are important inputs to the LGU scorecards and other indicators , being used to monitor progress of the ongoing health sector reforms. ' 

II. Objectives 

1.) To provide guidelines pertinent to the gathering of comprehensive and evidence-based information on the local health sector ﬁnancial situation as a necessary input to effective local governance for health; and 

2.) To set evidence—based local health policy directions in support of the FOURmula One for Health Framework. 

III. Scope 

This Administrative Order shall apply to DOH Central Ofﬁce units, Centers for Health Development and Provinces who will be estimating their local health accounts. Other DOH partners are encouraged to use the same for their LHA estimation activities. 

IV. Definition of Terms 

1. Health Care Financing (HCF) — a system of various structures, methods and processes in which ﬁnancial resources are made available to fund health sector activities. 

2. Local Health Accounts (LHA) — a system for examining and comprehensively estimating expenditures for health for a speciﬁc deﬁned sub—national geographic unit or a deﬁned “local” area of a country, such as a province. 

3. National Health Accounts (N HA) — a system for examining and comprehensively estimating the entire country’s expenditures for health in a given time period. 

4. Financing Source (FS) — institutions or entities that provide funds to the health system. 

5. Financing Agent (FA) —— institutions or entities that channel funds provided by ﬁnancing sources and use these funds to pay for, or purchase, the activities inside the health accounts boundary; furthermore, these are entities that have control over how the funds are used or have programmatic responsibilities. 

6. Health Providers (HP) ~— institutions or entities that receive money in exchange for or in anticipation of producing activities inside the health accounts boundary; or more speciﬁcally, these are entities that provide or deliver health care and health related services. 

7. Health Care Function (HC) — the types of goods and services provided and activities performed within the health accounts boundary. 

8. Resource Costs (RC) — the factors of production or inputs used by providers to produce goods and services consumed or the activities conducted within the health sector. 


V. General Guidelines 

1. LHA contributes to improved performance of local health systems, enables a health planning and policy development process that is evidence-based, and promotes transparency and accountability among local health stakeholders. 

2. The Department of Health shall ensure that LHA estimation is integrated in the implementation of reform initiatives involving partnership with LGUs such as the Province-wide Investment Plan for Health (PIPH), Annual Operation Plan (ADP) and LGUscorecard implementation. 

3. The LHA input data should be taken from regularly collected reports or records to make the production of LHA sustainable and inexpensive. 

4. The DOH shall develop a system linking with other National Government Agencies (N GAS) for provision and collection of data needed for LGUs to conduct a regular LHA estimation. 

5. The LHA estimation process shall involve multi-stakeholder participation and multi-level coordination across local, regional and national partners. 

6. The provincial LHA estimation shall be guided by the LHA Manual and LHA Estimation T 001 endorsed by the DOH. 

7. The DOH shall provide continuing technical assistance to LGUs in the estimation of their LHAs and capacitate the LGUs on the use of this tool for evidence—based decision-making process.

8. The DOH shall ensure that any improvement in the manual will be disseminated to concerned partners and stakeholders as necessary. 

9. The DOH shall be responsible for the development of a mechanism to disseminate provincial LHA outputs which shall include but which shall not be limited to the following: posting in DOH . websites, conduct of fora, meetings and discussion with stakeholders. 

VI. LHA Development Process 

A. Data Gathering. The LHA input data should, as much as possible, be taken from regularly collected reports or records to make the production of LHA sustainable and inexpensive to LGUs. LHA requires data from three levels of sources: provincial—based sources, regional level sources and national level sources. Provincial level data sources include ofﬁces of provincial and municipal/city governments. Regional level data sources primarily refer to offices of the DOH CHDs. National level data sources refer to DOH Central Ofﬁces, PhilHealth, National Statistics Ofﬁce (N SO) and National Statistical Coordination Board (N SCB). 

B. Estimation by Financing Agent and Completion of LHA Tables. Similarly, the tasks of data processing and LHA estimation can be divided in the same manner as the data collection tasks. The province will be responsible for producing the portions of the LHA for the following ﬁnancing agents: Provincial Government, Municipal/City Government and any other private ﬁnancing agents as may be identiﬁed to be important or signiﬁcant in the province. The CHD and DOH CO will be responsible for producing portions of the LHA for the following ﬁnancing agents: National Government, PhilHealth and houSehold out-of—pocket. 

Using the LHA Manual and LHA Estimation T 001, the province will consolidate the estimation results of the ﬁnancing agents and complete 3 basic LHA tables: Financing Agent by Financing Source (FAxF S), Financing Agent by Health Provider (FAxHP) and Financing Agent by Health Care Function (FAxHC). The province may also develop a fourth (advanced) table: Health Provider by Resource Costs (HPxRC). 

C. Analyzing the LHA Tables. The contribution of LHA to improving local health systems performance comes in the form of information that when used can bring better local health sector management, decision-making and policy formulation. 

LHA analysis should revolve on two general LHA uses: 1) proﬁling and monitoring patterns of health spending in a province (“What is”) and 2) identiﬁcation of areas for policy intervention (“What should be”) using results from the general proﬁle in combination with standards/targets or in combination with other related health sector statistics. 

D. Publication and Dissemination. The timely dissemination and sharing of LHA results and analyses to key provincial stakeholders (i.e. Local Health Boards, Inter-Local Health Zone Boards) is critical so that it becomes an input to heath planning and decision-making processes. Wider and regular dissemination of LHA outputs beyond the province can be facilitated by publishing reports, posting on the DOH website, and sharing through the Resource Center for Health System Development (RCHSD), among others. 

VII. Implementing Mechanisms The institutionalization of LHA estimation shall require the support of all levels of stakeholders to sustain the regular estimation of provincial LHA.
