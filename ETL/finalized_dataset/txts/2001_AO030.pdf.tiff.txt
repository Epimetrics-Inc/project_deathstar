<subject>Subject : Guidelines for the Implementation of the LGU Performance Program (LPP) for 2001-2002</subject>


<body>

Background:

The LGU Performance Program (LPP), one of the components of the Integrated Family Flaming Maternal Health Program (IFPMHP), is being implemented by the Department of Health (DOH) with funding assistance from USAID since 1994.

LPP is implemented in all regions and covers 98 provinces and independent cities. Starting 1999, the LPP has expanded its coverage to include municipalities and component cities. This expansion program is called the Matching-Grant (MGP).

Most of the activities in the implementation of LPP and MGP have been instutionalized at the Centers for Health Development (CHDs) with support from the Project Management Office (PMO) at the DOH Central Office.

With the completion date for LPP and MGP set for September 2002, activities are lined up to properly close out all transactions of the LPP With partner local government units within the remaining months of the Program life.

This Administrative Order serves the purpose of providing the necessary guidance to the CHDs and the PMO to efﬁciently close out the remaining transactions of the LPP and MGP in anticipation of its completion date.

Coverage:

The Guidelines stipulated in this Administrative Order (A0) shall cover all the CHDs, the PMO, the Provinces and Cities participating in the Base Grant, Matching Grant and Top Performers’s Programs of the LPP. All Cooperating Agencies working to support the implementation of LPP are likewise covered by this AO.

The Guidelines:

A. Funding and Allocation

1. Funds for the re—enrollment of currently participating Matching Grant Program (MGP) LGUs as well as the enrollment of those LGUs which will be covered for the first time thislyear will be provided using the allocation for LPP to be included in the DOH-Center for Health Development's (CHD's) budget for Year 2001 and 2002. Please refer to Annex A for the recomputed allocation per CHD.

2. Allocation for each MGP-participating LGU will be determined by each CHD depending on the total available budget and the number of Lgus to be covered by each CHD.

3. Funds for the Base Grant Participating Lgus which have been identified as eligible to still receive the Year 2000 Base Grant have been sourced from the Year 2000 realigned DOH budget suballotted to the corresponding CHD. These were credited as outstanding Accounts Payable of the CHDs. Request for the release and payment of the AccountsPayable will be through the DOH CHDs.

4. Base Grant Participating Lgus are no longer included in the computation of the total LPP budget per CHD.

5. I The management fund for the implementation of the LPP has been computed as 5% of the total re—computed budget of each CHD except for CHD for Southern Tagalog which is 2.38%. The breakdown of the allocation per CHD is shown in Annex A. As such, the CHD will no longer receive sub-allotments to be used in the conduct of monitoring, orientation and other activities to support LPP inasmuch as the allocation for these have been incorporated already in the LPP budget.

6. Provided funds are still available, the CHDs can budget and release the cash premiums of the Top Performing (TP) LGUs which will receive their premium grants for the ﬁrst time. It will be sourced from the remaining LPP budget of the CHDs after all the LGUs enrolled or to be enrolled in the Matching Grant Program have been provided with their respective allocations and the cost of the management fund subtracted.

B. Utilization of Funds among Base Grant Participating Provinces and Cities

1. Base Grant Recipients, speciﬁcally Provinces, with outstanding unobligated balance of 2 1M out of its LPP funds whether released from the DOH CHD or Central Ofﬁce as of June 30, 2001 is required to subgrant at least 90% of the unobligated balance to municipalities within their areas. Included in this category are Base Grant Lgus which will receive their year 2000 grant this year (2001).

The remaining 10% of the unobligated funds will be used to support the program activities for family planning, immunization and vitamin A capsule supplementation.

2. The 10% support to program activities identiﬁed in item B.2 above can be increased if and only if the amount is not enough to pursue speciﬁc activities which are necessary to support the program. These activities are limited to : (a) renovation or construction of warehouse, and (b) renovation or construction of cold chain facility.

3. Independent Cities which-are Base Grant Recipients whose total cumulative unobligated balance as of June 30, 2001 is 2 P500,000 will automatically be converted as a Matching Grant Program—participating LGU. Therefore, a corresponding re-planning activity will be conducted by these LGUs with the assistance provided by the CHDs and the Management Sciences for Health.

4. LGUs which have remaining unobligated balance which are less than PlM (Province) and P500,000 (cities) may still pursue subgranting if they so prefer.

5. By the end of June 2002, the cumulative liquidation of the total LPP grants released to all Base Grant Recipients (i.e. whether a Province or Independent City), should be 100%. This liquidation rate is inclusive of the sub-granted funds to the municipalities mentioned in Item B. 1. above. The basis for determining the liquidation rate is the Fund Utilization Report submitted to either the DOH CHDs or Central Ofﬁce.

6. All remaining unobligated LPP funds by June 30, 2002 will be reverted back to the Department of Health, Central or CHDs depending on where the funds remain unliquidated. Cheques should be forwarded‘to DOH not later than July 15, 2002.

7. Lgus belonging to the category described in item 3.1 and B3 above which decided not to adopt the subgranting scheme should revert to DOH, either the CHD or Central Ofﬁce, their unobligated balance as of December 31, 2001. Cheques should be forwarded to DOH not later than January 15, 2002.

C. Release of funds for Top Performing LGUs and its Utilization

1. Funds to be released to Top Performing LGUs cannot be drawn from the budget intended for the Matching Grant Program LGUs. Only the unallocated portion of the LPP fund of the CHDs will be used for TP LGUs.

2. In the event that there is remaining funds for the TP LGUs, the following prioritization can be used to determine which LGUs should receive the cash premitim:

2.a Priority 1 — Top Performing LGUs which have attained 90% cumulative liquidation of their total LPP grant and are not to receive any Year 2000 base grant;

2.b Priority 2 - Top Performing Lgus with 90% liquidation of the total LPP grant including the Year 2000 base grant;

2.c Least Priority -— Top Performing ”LGU with less than 90% liquidation rate of their cumulatiVe LPP grants and is scheduled to receive the Year 2000 base grant.

necessary recommendations regarding the submitted

Reprogramming Plan on or before August 15,2001. Delay in
