The Department of Health through its Bureau of Food and Drugs (IBFAD) shall ensure the Safety, efficacy and good quality of Herbal Medicines.

This Order shall be applicable toail herbal medicines except as provided herein:

1. Medicines/drugs that do not fall within the definition of herbal medicines cited in this regulation shall be governed by other regulations promulgated for drugs in general.

2. Herbal preparations which are fresh piant material or which have not undergone any process or treatment other than what is essential to their proper drying packaging, and storage.

III. DEFINITION OF TERMS

For the purpose of this Order, the terms:

Plant Materiai means fresh or dried aerial or underground part(s) of a plant such as leaves, flowers, fruits, seeds, stems, wood, bark, roots, rhizomes or other plant parts, which maybe entire, fragmented or powdered, including juices, gums, fatty oils, essential oils, and any other substance derived from the plant to be used as is orIfor further processing such as for galenicals or pharmaceutical dosage forms.

Herbal Medicines are finished, labeled medicinal products that contain as active ingredient(s) aerial or underground part(s) of plants or any other plant material or combInatIon thereof, whether in the crude state or as plant preparations. Herbal medicines may contain excipients in addition to the active ingredient(s).

Additionally, such medicinal plant products shall have speciﬁc therapeutic claim(s) and shall be intended for use in the diagnosis, alleviation, cure or treatment of disease, promotion of health or intended to affect or modify the structure or any function of the body of humans or animals.

Drug preparations containing plant material(s) combined with chemically defined therapeutically active substances, including chemically defined isolated constitirents of plants used in conventional/western medicines are not considered to be herbal medicines.

Common Name refers to the generally accepted local name of the plant as recognized In ethno-botanical or other relevant literature.

Scientific Name refers to the binomial nomenclature consisting of the genus and the species to which the specific plant belongs and the name of the author, based on a systematic classification indicating genetic relationships, in which both terms are underlined or italicized and the first letter of the genus is capitalized.

Official Name refers to the scientific name, common/local name and the part of the active plant material used in the preparation of the herbal medicine. (ex. Vifex negundo L, Lag'undi Leaf) Note: This definition also refers to the- Official. Title as stated in the Philippine Pharmacopoeia.
