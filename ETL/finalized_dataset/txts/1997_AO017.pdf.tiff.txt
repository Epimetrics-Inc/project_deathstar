<subject>SUBJECT: Administration of the Combined Diphtheria-Whole Cell Pertussis, Tetanus (DPT)-Hepatitis B Vaccine (TRITANRIX HB10) to Children Ages 6 Weeks to 1 Year in Selected Health Center</subject>

<body>

I. Introduction:

The Department of Health (DOH) through the Maternal and Child Health Services (MCHS) is responsible for providing policies, standards, guidelines and services in the promotion of safe motherhood and child health. One of its main program is the Expanded Program on Immunization (EPI) with the aim of reducing vaccine preventable diseases such as Tuberculosis, Diphtheria, Pertussis, Tetanus, Poliomyelitis, Measles and hepatitis B, through complete immunization of children 0-12 months of age. Diphtheria-Pertussis-Tetanus and Hepatitis B (HB) vaccines are injectable vaccines given in 3 doses together with OPV. A quadrivalent DPT-HB vaccine has been developed and among its benefits are fewer injections, fewer syringes and needles, less storage, shipment and administrative cost. Smith Kline Beecham Research Limited has come up with such combination - the TRITANRIX-HB10.

SmithKline Beecham (SB) is donating about 100,000 doses of TRITANRIX-HB10 for trial use by the DOH in its immunization program for infants ages 6 weeks to 1 year. The MCHS in collaboration with SB conducted a project to document and evaluate the possible adverse reactions following the TRITANRIX-HB10 and its acceptability among the parents and the service providers.



II. Target Population:

A total 30,000 Filipino children ages 6 weeks to 1 year without previous DPT or Hepatitis B vaccine immunization shall be the primary targets for the 3 doses of TRITANRIX-HB10.



III. Characteristics of the Vaccine

TRITANRIX-HB10 contains diphtheria (D), tetanus (T) toxoid, inactivated pertussis bacteria (Pw) and the purified major surface antigen of the hepatitis B virus (HBV), adsorbed on aluminum salts.

Each 0.5 ml. dose of vaccine contains minimum 30 IU of adsorbed diphtheria and minimum 60IU of adsorbed tetanus toxoid, minimum 4 IU of adsorbed pertussis vaccine, of aluminum hydroxide and aluminum phosphate equivalent to 0.4 mg. of adjuvants and 0.025 mg. of sodium thimerfonate as preservative. The vaccine is presented as a whitish, turbid suspension.



IV. Dosage, Route and Site Administration

The recommended dose (0.5 ml.) for 3 doses of the Tritanrix HB10 shall be administered deep intramuscular (IM) on the left anterolateral part of the thigh and can start from the age of 6 weeks onwards. Subsequent doses of vaccine must be administered within an interval of at least 4 to 8 weeks. The longer the interval between subsequent closes, the higher the antibody titers.

It should not be administered intravenously because of risk of anaphylactic shock.

VI. Vaccine Storage and Handling:

Tritanrix HB10 shall be transported, stored and handled similar to DPT, TT and Hep B vaccines. It shall be Stored in refrigerators provided solely for vaccine storage at +2°C to +8°C. It shall be transported in properly ice-packed  containers with cold chain monitors. DO NOT FREEZE. Discard if the vaccine  has been frozen.

The vaccine is presented as a turbid-white suspension in a monodose glass vial and 10-dose glass vials. Upon storage, a white deposit and clear  supernatant can be observed.

PRIOR TO ADMINISTRATION, the vaccine should be well shaken in order to obtain a homogeneous turbid suspension and visually inspected for any  foreign particulate matter and/or variation of physical aspect. In the event of  either being observed, discard the vaccine.



VII. Adverse Reactions and How to Manage these:

Adverse reactions can be seen following immunization and it can be due  to the intrinsic characteristics of the vaccine or to the technique or handling oe the so—called program-related cause. However, some reactions will occur  coincidentally after immunization which is not due to immunization and would happen had the child no been vaccinated. 

The usual side effect of an injection such as inflammation and pain at the injection site should be managed in the same way as for the other vaccines. (with antipyretics and physical care) 



VIII. Recording of Immunization Given:

The immunization of the child shall be recorded in the Growth Monitdoring Cards (GMC) and in the Target Client List (TCL) or masterlist.

If there are no GMCm any recording sheet can be used. However, these shall be replaced with GMC as soon as these are available.



IX. Reporting, Monitoring, Supervision and Evaluation:

The total number of children immunized with Tritanrix HB10 shall be reported in the FHSlS Form for the FIC Coverage.

All children vaccinated with the vaccine shall be regularly be monitored and supervised by the RHMS/RHNs with regards to development of adverse reactions and for follow-up for the succeeding doses.

This Administrative Order shall take effect immediately
