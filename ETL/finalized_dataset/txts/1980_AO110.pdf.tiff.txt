This Office has been informed that hospitals under the Ministry of Health follow different procedures in accepting trainees under the Volunteer Training Program and without spelling out clearly the regulations under which their continued stay in the hospital premises should be permitted. In the interest, therefore, of the public service and to effect a more responsive manpower development program that will provide greater skills and valuab1e experience to the trainees, the following rules are hereby issued for the information, reference, guidance and strict compliance by chiefs of hospitals concerned:

1. The Volunteer Trainee Program of hospitals shall cover only those who have passed the corresponding board examinations such as those on nursing, dietetics, medical technology, social work, pharmacy, midwifery or medicine;

2. Trainees accepted by the hospitals under the Program shall perform their duties exclusively during the morning shift; that is, from 7:00 A.M. to 3:00 P.M.;

3. Trainees shall at all times be under the close supervision of his/her immediate supervisor for more effective training and to avoid possible complications arising from the performance of their duties under the Program;

4. Trainees shall be required to observe hospital rules and regulations pertinent to their training;

5. The training period shall not exceed six months to enable others equally qualified in acquiring the needed experience and skills in hospital work;

9. The number of trainees that shall be accepted under the Volunteer Trainee Program in each hospital shall depend on the following factors: bed category of the hospital; physical facilities; staffing pattern, supervisor-subordinate ratio for effective supervision. The Director of Medical Services is hereby directed to fix the number of trainees in hospitals based on the above factors and on others which he deems relevant.
