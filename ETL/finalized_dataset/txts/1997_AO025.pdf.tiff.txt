<subject>SUBJECT: POLICIES AND PROCEDURES IN WITHHOLDING EMPLOYEES’ SALARIES BASED ON THEIR ATTENDANCE RECORDS</subject>

<body>

In the interest of the service and in order to carry out the Department’s goals towards an efficient socially responsible organization, the following policies and procedures on withholding/releasing employees' salary/ies vis-a—vis their attendance records are hereby prescribed: 


1. All Heads of Offices shall ensure that the Monthly Reports of Attendance (MRA) of employees under them are submitted to the Personnel Division, Administrative-Service (PD,AS) not later than the 5th working day of the succeeding month.


2. The salary/ies of employee/s shall be withheld under the following instances and the same can only be released upon submission of the required documents to the Personnel Division: 

a. Failure to submit the bundy cards within the prescribed period.

b. Failure to file appropriate application for leave.


3. Heads of Offices are enjoined to review the payroll before affixing their signatures in it and inform the Personnel Division accordingly about their respective personnel whose salaries ought to be withheld.

4. An official advice to the Cashier Section to withhold or release any employee's salary/ies shall emanate from the Personnel Division using the attached form. 

5. The same form shall be used for purposes of salary deduction for employee/s who went on approved leave of absence or incurred tardiness/undertime but whose leave credits have already been exhausted.

6. The withheld salary/ies of an employee shall only be released by the Cashier Section upon receipt of the advice from the Personnel Division, otherwise, the Cashier Section Staff shall be held accountable. Release of salary without receipt of proper advice is considered ground for disciplinary action.

7. If the salaries that have been already withheld for two (2) pay periods are still not released within five (5) calendar days from the second pay period due to non-submission of certain required documents by concerned employees, his/her/their name/s shall be cancelled from the payroll. However, the withheld salaries can be claimed through a disbursement voucher as soon as soon as the required documents shall have been  complied with.

 
This order shall take effect immediately.
