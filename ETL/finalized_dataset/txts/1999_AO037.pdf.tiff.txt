<subject>SUBJECT: REVISED OPERATIONAL GUIDELINES FOR THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE DOCTORS TO THE BARRIOS (DTTB) PROGRAM</subject>

<body>

I. RATIONALE

Given the reality where there is varying pace of development and inequitable distribution of scarce resources, 271 municipalities were identified in 1992 to be doctorless and lacking in the capability to provide adequate health services resulting in high mentality and morbidity rates in these areas.

The Doctors to the Barrios (DTTB) Program was created by the DOH in May 1993 to address this need. The Program trained and fielded competent, compassionate and community-oriented doctors as an assistance package in the identified doctorless local government units (LGUs) nationwide, mostly depressed, marginalized, remote and 5th and 6th class municipalities. To date, a total of 249 doctors have been deployed to 27 96 and as 56% of the identified 5th and 6th class municipalities, respectively. These doctors have served 198 municipalities (some municipalities were served more than once due to exigency of service), or 73% of the targetted doctorless LGUs.

As a more recent development, several provinces are likewise suffering from inadequacy of medical/surgical care. District hospitals are undermanned by professional health workers, especially doctors, and many low—income class provinces can not find the doctors to fill up empty posts.

In this regard, the DTTB Program is being expanded to include deployment of doctors in District Hospitals (DHs). The expansion would ensure a more comprehensive approach to the improvement of the health care delivery system, to cover both the preventive and curative aspects of health care. This innovation also forms part of the upgrading of district hospitals under the District Health System Development which is a major thrust of the current DOH management. 


II. OBJECTIVE

To ensure quality health care services in depressed, marginalized and unserved/underserved areas through the deployment of competent and community-oriented doctors


III. COVERAGE

1. Depressed and marginalized municipalities without doctors for at least two (2) years

2. In case the requests from RFOs exceed the total number of available DTTB items, prioritization shall be done by the DOH-CO to give preference to depressed, marginalized and unserved areas, prioritizing further municipalities or DHs with the longest periods of doctorless or underservice (only one doctor in the hospital).
