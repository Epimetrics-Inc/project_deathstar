<subject>SUBJECT: DELISTING DIPYRONE IN THE REGISTRY OF DRUGS WITH THE BUREAU OF FOOD AND DRUGS (BFAD)</subject>

<body>
 
After weighing all the findings and recommendation relating to the registration of Dipyrone, this Office determines that there is no basis to retain Dipyrone in the registry of drug products in the Philippines.

Wherefore, Dipyrone is hereby delisted from the BFAD drug registry and henceforth, any of its form will no longer be registered for the Philippine market.

The BFAD is directed to implement an orderly phase-out of all the existing stocks of dipyrone-containing products in the market.
