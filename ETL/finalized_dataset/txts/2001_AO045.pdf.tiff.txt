<body>
1. INTRODUCTION

Cognizant of the fact that Dengue Fever is considered one of the most important viral diseases, the Department of Health has put in place a Dengue Prevention and Control Program and has issued out several administrative orders (AOs) and department circulars (DCs) to support program implementation. AO 121-A s. 1998 focuses on DOH policies as well as guiding principles for the National Dengue Prevention and Control Program, AO 281 s. 1996 highlights the "National Tepok Lamok and Dengue Sapok Program which enjoins everybody to observe the 4'oclock habit fully backed up by a Memorandum of Agreement signed by various agencies, and Department Circular 187-A s. 1991 is "Guidelines for the prevention and control of Dengue Hemorrhagic Fever which include criteria for diagnosis, management, methods of control, surveillance and reporting system. AO No. 9—A s. 1998 is a guideline on space spraying or fogging during epidemics. This Order details out larviciding as the best approach in reducing the sources of the breeding habitats of dengue mosquito vectors.

Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus mosquito vectors of dengue are container-breeders. Aedes could breed in any container or receptacle, essential (useful) or non-essential (useless) that can hold water. Those that are considered useless such as tin cans, bottles, plastic cups and styrofoams could be destroyed or disposed but essential containers like large drums, pails and plant axils such as bromeliads, bananas, abacas, fortune plants that cannot be destroyed and easily disposed may require chemical larviciding. This method has also been applied in drinking water containers and selectively on containers positive for Aedes larvae only especially during high transmission season in other Southeast Asian countries.

The World Health Organization-Western Pacific Regional Office (WHO Guidelines for Dengue Surveillance and Mosquito Control, 1995) dengue control strategy emphasizes larviciding and other strategies:

1) Reduction and ultimately elimination of Aedes aegypti breeding sites by waste disposal, biological or chemical treatment of water and other waste management measures by families, communities and municipal services.

2) At the beginning of dengue season, campaigns for intensifying larval control and strengthening case management through training and information education campaign (IEC).

3) Control of epidemics by intensified larval control measures including larviciding.

4) Integration with Healthy Cities, Healthy Schools.

Larviciding is difficult and expensive on a long-term basis. However, it is best in situations where epidemiological data indicate the existence of risk periods and localities where epidemics might occur. Furthermore, larvicide application is advantageous in the sense that mosquitoes are destroyed before they disperse to human habitation and that this can be applied by hand and carried out in a short time.

II. OBJECTIVE

To set guidelines and procedures on correct applications of larvicides particularly during the dengue season.

III. GENERAL PROCEDURES

A. Temephos as the recommended insecticide

The insecticides for larval control of dengue mosquitoes may be chosen on the basis of the following:

1. Toxicity and safety to humans and environment. Insecticides should be duly registered with the Fertilizer and Pesticide Authority and recommended for larviciding.
2. Effectiveness against the larval stages of the vector.
3. Cost of the larvicide.
4. Odor of the larvicide.

Pyrethroids is one type of organic insecticide groups that can be used as larvicide for Dengue Vector Control. These are synthetic compounds. The chemical structure is patterned after pyrethrins (extracted from the chrysanthemum flower) which is a mixture of six esters. Deltamethrin and Permethrin can be used as mosquito larvicides but their use should be limited to special cases only because these are toxic to fish, crustaceans and other aquatic animals.

Organophosphorous (OP) comprise a large group of compounds which are generally acutely toxic to man and vertebrate animals, non-persistent or have a short residual activity. Organophosphorous compounds most commonly used as larvicides are temephos, fenthion and chlorpyrifos.

Of these insecticide groups, Temephos is the recommended insecticide for the control of mosquito larvae due to its low effective dosage (WHO, 1997). It has low toxicity to fish, birds, mammals and humans. The Lethal Dose50 is 8600 mg/kg, classified as unlikely to present acute hazard in normal use.

B. Formulation and Application

Temephos is tetramethyl-thiodiphenylene phosphorothioate formulated as fine granules impregnated with 1-5% of the compound. These are grains of sands or absorptive materials coated with insecticide which are relatively heavy and sinks to the bottom of the breeding site. This makes it appropriate for bottom feeders Aedes aegypti. These granules can be spread by spoon.

The following table is a WHO recommended guide on the amount of temephos in grams and its equivalent in teaspoon needed to treat various sizes of water containers.

Quantities of 1% Temephos Sand Granules Required to Treat Different Size Water Containers to Kill Mosquito Larvae

• Frequency of Application

Temephos Sand granules (SG) can be applied in large water containers or plant axils. The recommended dosage in drinking water is 0.5 - 1 mg of active ingredient, corresponding to 20 grams (2 teaspoonfuls) of 1% sand granule formulation in a 200 — liter drum, where it remains effective for about five weeks (Rozendaal, Jan, 1997).

The application of Temephos 1% sand granule in large water containers shall be repeated every 5 weeks.

In a 100-liter porous earthen jars where the water is not changed, 10 gms. of Temephos 1% SG or a dosage of 1 ppm, effective control against Aedes aegypti is provided for 8 - 12 weeks. In this case, the application shall be repeated every 2 or 3 months.

• Where to Apply Temephos 1% SG

1) In dengue sensitive areas such as localities with House Index (HI) 3 5% and or Breteau index (BI) 3: 20%.
2) In localities where Dengue Fever/Dengue Hemorrhagic Fever has been recorded in the past.
3) In the localities of the above situations where 20% and above of the breeding sites are large water containers. These are the essential containers which cannot be disposed of and are difficult to mosquito-proof.

• When to Apply Larvicide

Larviciding shall be done at the beginning of dengue season (WHO - WPRO Dengue Strategy). In the Philippines, dengue season begins at the start of rainy season which is June and July. In as much as June of every year is Dengue Awareness Month (Dept. Circ. No. 67 - B s. 1998), community awareness and participation in the elimination, destruction and reduction of breeding sites for Aedes, larviciding of essential containers should be included in the activities during the period.

IV. IMPLEMENTING MECHANISM

Larviciding as another strategy for controlling dengue shall be implemented through the following units with their specific roles and responsibilities:

A. Program Management and provision of technical assistance

The Dengue Prevention and Control Program of the Center for Infectious Disease, National Center for Disease Prevention and Control provides the technical guidelines of this Administrative Order and be available for technical assistance.

B. Overall supervision and management at the local levels

The Center for Health Development - Regional Dengue Coordinating Committee in coordination with the provincial, city, municipal and other field health personnel shall implement the Administrative Order.

C. Service provision and networking

The Local Government Units (LGUs) in partnership with the DOH will implement the AD. Community leaders shall arrange and undertake clean-up of non-essential, useless containers while the essential water containers and other breeding sites not used for food or drinking shall be treated with Temephos by the Rural Sanitary Inspector (RSI). The RSI have been given previous technical information on the correct application of Temephos.

D. Logistics

The Center for infectious Disease of the National Center for Disease Prevention and Control shall provide Temephos 1% SC to 16 Centers for Health Development for 2001 - 2002. The Centers for Health Development shall appropriate funds for procurement or coordinate with their respective LGUs to support their subsequent logistic needs.

V. EFFECTIVITY

These guidelines on correct application of larvicide for the breeding sites of Dengue vector mosquitoes shall take effect immediately.
