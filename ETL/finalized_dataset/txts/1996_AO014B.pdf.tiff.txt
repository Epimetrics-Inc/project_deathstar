<subject>SUBJECT: TECHNICAL GUIDELINES IN THE STRATIFICATION OF MALARIA-ENDEMIC AREAS.</subject>

<body> 

A critical component of malaria control is the epidemiological assessment of malarious areas in order to document key local patterns of transmission and disease and to pinpoint priority areas for intervention. The experience gained in this type of stratiﬁcation in other countries has increased the usefulness of the process in assisting malaria programs to establish operational priorities. A general sense of the focality and diversity of key variables is essential in order to determine the framework for rational stratiﬁcation.


1. DEFINITION 

Stratification of the Malaria-Endemic Areas is the process of classifying the different endemic sides or localities of a particular barangay into type “A”, type “B” and type “MEPA” areas, endemic area being defined as having the malaria vector mosquito and the factors for transmission.


2. OBJECTIVES

2.1 Io establish operational priorities based on defined criteria for stratiﬁcation wherein malaria prevention and control measures will be appropriate and applicable.

2.2. To guide planners in resource allocation.


3. CRITERIA

3.1 Parasite Rate in Children 10 years old and below

3.2 Terrain or Topography

3.3 Social Economic and Cultural Conditions

 
4. CHARACTERISTIC OF THE 3 TYPES BASED ON THE CRITERIA

5. GUIDELINES

5.1 This shall be done and updated by the Field Assistance Worker (FAW) or the Municipal Malaria Coordinator (MMC) every three (3) years.

5.2 The consolidated Provincial Stratiﬁcation Data should be submitted to the Malaria Control Service (MCS) before the end of the 3rd quarter of the year. 

5.3 Table 1 illustrates the Stratiﬁcation of Areas and the Appropriate Control Strategies to be implemented.
