<subject>SUBJECT: Infection Control Measures for Dental Health Services</subject>

<body>

I. RATIONALE:

The Dental Care Personnel (DCP) in the delivery of service are repeatedly exposed to ora1 fluids such as blood and saliva. These oral fluids maybe contaminated with a variety of pathogenic or non— pathogenic microorganisms and viruses. Patients and DCP carrying blood-borne viruses and other infections which are asymptomatic may be unaware of their carrier infectious status. In the absence of screening of all patients for known infections, all blood and saliva must be considered infectious.

Although infection control has been practiced in dentistry for many years, the needI for it has been emphasized dramatically by two recent events. The first event is the recognition that Hepatitis B is a significant occupational hazard for dental personnel. The second event is the tremendous public and professional reactions to the hazards of AIDS.

In response to these emerging needs, infection control measures for dental public health services have to be instituted by the field, hospital and dental public health services.



II. OBJECTIVES:

General:

To prevent the spread of infection from patient to patient, from dental clinic personnel to patient, and from patient to dental clinic personnel.

Specific:

1. Standardize measures in the prevention of cross-infection in the dental clinic.

2. Know the kinds of personal protective devices that should be routinely used during each procedure.



III. COVERAGE: 

This infection Control measures shall cover all dental services in rural/urban health centers, hospitals, whether retained or devolved private schools and occupational establishments in the Philippines.



IV. SPECIFIC CONTROL MEASURES:


A. The Medical History

It is mandatory for all dental practitioners to take a thorough medical history from all patients.


B. Universal Precaution

The blood of all dental patients should be considered as infectious. It is therefore mandatory for all dental personnel to use the same infection control practices on all patients.


C. Immunization

It is recommended that all dental health care personnel involved in patient care delivery receive the Hepatitis B vaccine, if they do not have immunity as a result of previous exposure to the virus.

However, priority for immunization should be those dental personnel who are directly exposed to spatter of blood and saliva.


D. Handwashing

Handwashing is one of the most important procedure in preventing infection. Hands should be washed with water and soap or any antibacterial agent (see Annex A) before putting on gloves and after their use because of the possibility that gloves may have defects or incur tears not visible to the eye which may allow microorganisms to contact skin. If a glove becomes torn or punctured, it should be removed and hands should be washed as soon as patient care permits. If hands become contaminated with blood, wash them immediately and thoroughly.


B. Use of Specific Protective Devices

1. Gloves

Gloves must be worn at all times when treating patients. They must be changed in between patients and procedures, whether they are worn for treatment or examination. Disposable gloves should not be reused.

2. Mask

A mask should be worn at all times during oral examination and clinical procedures to protect both patient and dental clinic personnel from exposure to blood and saliva.

3. Protective Eyewear

It is recommended that protective eyewear must be worn during oral prophylaxis and restorative procedures to protect the eyes from the spatter of blood, saliva and oral debris.

4. Gowns

A protective gown should be worn during clinical procedures to provide additional protection from possible exposure to blood and other body fluids.

The "isolation" type gown is ideal, for special surgical procedures since it covers the arms and fits closely around the neck.

5. Surface Barrier Technique

Environmental surfaces predisposed to contamination with spatter of saliva or blood during treatment and which may not be disinfected with Chemical solutions should be covered with materials like plastic wrap, aluminum foil, impervious backed paper, polyethylene sheets or plastic tubing. After each clinical procedure, the covering should be removed and changed with a new one.

6. Antiretraction Valve

It is recommended that antiretraction valves (one-way flow check valves) should be installed to prevent fluid aspiration and to reduce the risk of transfer of potentially infective materials. However, in the absence of antiretraction valve, flush out air and waterlines of handpieces by running/operating it for 20—30 minutes.


F. Cleaning, Sterilization and Disinfection

1. Cleaning

Cleaning should be a standard procedure before, during and after any dental procedure. Items which are not directly associated with treatment such as sinks, walls, floors, furnishings and the likes should be washed with water and soap or any disinfectant detergent (chlorox or see Annex B), this should be done routinely. Cleaning up of visible spills of blood and other body fluids should be undertaken using hospital approved disinfectants. Instruments should be cleansed under running water or soaked in water to prevent drying of blood prior to disinfection or sterilization.

2. Disinfection

Disinfection (see Annex B) must be done to non-critical items and equipment which do not normally penetrate or contact mucous membranes but which are exposed to spatter, spray, splashing of blood or are touched by contaminated hands.

3. Sterilization

All critical items or instruments which penetrate oral soft tissues and bone. such as surgical instruments. periodontal knives, scalers and the likes and semi critical items or instruments which come in contact with the mucous membrane such as impression trays, amalgam carriers, plastic filling materials and the likes, should be sterilized after each use. Autoclave or dry heat ovens are the recommended procedures for sterilization.

For heat sensitive instruments i.e. mouth mirrors, non-autoclavable handpieces, ours and the likes, cold sterilization is recommended.


G. Use of Disposable Instruments

Disposable instruments (e.g. prophylactic angles; prophylactic cups and brushes; tips for high speed air evacuators, saliva ejectors, and air/water syringes) should be used once, not intended to be cleaned, disinfected, or sterilized for re-use.


H. Laboratory Materials and Intra-oral Devices

Impressions must be cleaned from any debris, saliva or blood with water and should be disinfected with an accepted disinfectant before being poured with cast stones or delivered to the dental laboratory.

Prosthodontic and orthodontic appliances should be disinfected with Iodophore before insertion.


I. Disposal of Waste Materials

Disposable materials each as gloves, masks, wipes and surface covers which are contaminated with blood or body fluids should be carefully handled and discarded in sturdy, impervious plastic bags to minimize human contact. Blood, suctioned fluids, or other liquid waste may be carefully poured into a drain connected to a sanitary sewerage system. Care should be taken to ensure compliance with applicable local regulations. Sharp items. such as needles and scalpel blades, should be placed intact into puncture - resistant containers before disposal in plastic bags. Human tissues maybe handled in the same manner as sharp items. Contaminated solid wastes and sharp items should be disposed using color coded bags, as follows:

a. Black bag — general waste
b. Yellow bag — infectious waste
c. Red bag - sharp waste

Infectious medical waste, including tissues and culture media, should be handled in a manner consistent with local regulations before disposal.

Liquid chemicals should be carefully poured into a drain connected to a sewer, while flushing with a generous amount of water.


J. Personal Grooming

It is mandatory for all dental personnel to maintain proper personal grooming whenever they are in the dental clinic environment. i.e. fingernails must be trimmed, hair should be combed properly, wear clean clothes, among others.



V. GUIDELINES FOR MANAGEMENT OF PATIENTS WHO HAVE HIGH—RISK INFECTIOUS DISEASES

It is emphasized that Universal Precautions should be practiced by all staff who are in contact with potentially infectious materials. Blood, saliva and gingival fluid from ALL patients should be considered infectious. The following steps should be taken in the management of patients who are diagnosed to have HIV, HVB and other infectious diseases.

Known HIV positive patients should be given needed dental treatment. However, those requiring invasive treatment may be referred to the hospital provided that it has an HIV AIDS Core Team (HACT). Management of patients with HIV AIDS should be in accordance with the guidelines stated in the DOH Administrative Order No. 18 s. 1995 (The Revised Guidelines in the Management of HIV—AIDS Patients in the Hospital)

Patients who are diagnosed to have infectious diseases should be given needed dental treatment, provided that strict adherence to all infection control measures be followed.

RECOMMENDED STEPS TO BE TAKEN WHEN ACCIDENTAL INJURY/EXPOSURE TO HIV, HBV AND OTHER INFECTIOUS DISEASES HAPPEN DURING DENTAL TREATMENT

It is emphasized that the universal precautions should be practiced by all staff who are in contact with potentially infectious materials. However, because of the absence of any policy or guidelines specifying what should be done to health workers who have encountered accidental injury/exposure to HIV/HBV and other infectious diseases, the following recommended steps should be undertaken:


A. Post Exposure Emergency Aid

For Pre—cutaneous exposure:

- immediately induce bleeding from the site of exposure
— disinfect the site of exposure

For skin, wash the site liberally with soap and tap water.

For mucous membrane and eyes, expose site under running water for at least one minute, or longer if possible.


B. Record Circumstances of Exposure

- this should be kept as a Confidential Record,
- this should be done properly as it may be a medico-legal document,
— the record will include the following details:

i. Name of patient
ii. Date and time as exposure
iii. Job duty being performed by worker at time of exposure
iv. Details of exposure including:

* amount of fluid or material (if actual amount cannot be given, then give approximate amount)
* type of fluid or material,
* type of exposure, and
* severity of exposure, for instance:
- for a precutaneous exposure, depth of injury and whether fluid was injected;
- for a skin or mucous membrane exposure, the extent and duration of contact and the condition of the skin, e.g. chapped, abraded, intact.
v. Description of source of exposure including, if known, whether the source material contained HIV or HBV and other infectious diseases.


C. Visit Any Medical Facility or Agency for Examination, Counselling and Testing of Titers.



VI. PROCUREMENT OF EQUIPMENT, SUPPLIES AND MATERIALS

It shall be the responsibility of the administrator of private school and occupational establishments, head of hospitals, local government executives of the dental services (LGU, hospital, occupational, and private school) to provide the necessary equipment, supplies and materials needed in the efficient and effective implementation of these infection control measures.

A regular procurement plan shall be prepared and submitted to authorities concerned to ensure availability of supplies and materials at all times.



VII. MONITORING AND SUPERVISION

For effective enforcement and implementation of the Infection Control measures for Dental Health Services, monitoring and supervision shall be in accordance with the guidelines for rural, hospital, private school and occupational dental health services.

Any order contrary is hereby superseded.

This order shall take effect on March 10, 1998.
