<subject>SUBJECT: Implementing Guidelines for the Polio-Free Maintenance Immunization Campaign</subject>


<body> 

The Philippines is committed to sustain poliomyelitis eradication until global certiﬁcation is achieved in 2005. In the past, strategies such as the National Immunization Days (NIDs)/Knock-Out Polio (KOP) and the Subnational Immunization Days (SNIDs) as well as the establishment of the Acute Flaccid Paralysis (APP) Surveillance have resulted in the certiﬁcation of the Philippines as Polio-Free, together with the rest of the Western Paciﬁc Region (WPR) in October 2000.

However, three (3) cases of recombinant or mutant polio strain were detected in 2001 as a result of high quality AFP Surveillance System. This recombinant strain can behave like wild poliovirus, i.e., it can also cause outbreaks. Containing the spread of the virus is therefore a matter of national emergency. As an immediate response, mop-up operations have been conducted in the affected areas. To ﬂush out any remaining mutant polio strains across the country, two more rounds of polio immunization activities will be conducted as part of the Polio—Free Maintenance Immunization Campaign, otherwise known as Batik Patak Kontra Polio, on February 2—8 (Round 1) and March 2—8, 2002 (Round 2).

The objective of the campaign is to immunize all children aged 0-59 months old with Oral Polio Vaccine (OPV), regardless of their immunization status. The attached “Implementing Guidelines for the Polio—Free Maintenance Immunization Campaign for Door-to-Door Patak and for Patak Centers” is hereby adopted to govern polio eradication activities nationwide.

For immediate dissemination and compliance.
