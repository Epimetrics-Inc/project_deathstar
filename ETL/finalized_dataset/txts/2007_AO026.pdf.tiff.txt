<subject>SUBJECT: Revitalization of the Mother-Baby Friendly Hospital Initiative in Health Facilities with Maternity and Newborn Care Services</subject>


<body>

I. RATIONALE

The WHO experts on child health estimates that 19% of under five (5) year-old deaths in the Philippines can be traced to inappropriate feeding practices including formula feeding. In the first two (2) months of life, an infant who is not breastfed is up to twenty—five (25) times more likely to die from diarrhea and four (4) times more likely to die from pneumonia than an exclusively breastfed child.

Only sixteen percent (16%) of infants at five (5) months of age were exclusively breastfed. Thirty-nine percent (39%) are using infant formula in their ﬁrst twelve (12) months of life. Thirteen percent (13%) of infants were never breastfed, making the Philippines the lowest in ever—breastfed rates among ﬁfty-six (56) countries that have conducted a Demographic Health Survey (DHS) in the past ten (10) years.

In 2003, the infant mortality rate (IMR) was 29 per 1000 live births. Improvements in the health and nutrition status of infants and young children through exclusive and extended breastfeeding as well as proper complementary feeding will significantly contribute to the achievement of the Millennium Development Goal (MDG) of reducing infant mortality by two-thirds by the year 2015.

Almost all children can be breastfed and the decision of the pregnant mother to breastfeed starts even before the delivery of the newborn. It is therefore in the health facilities where the opportunity to drive across the message to breastfeed can be initiated and nurtured by providing emphasis on the greater social roles of the health

The results of the National Demographic Health Survey (NDHS) conducted in 2003 showed that deliveries attended by health professionals or those delivered in health facilities are less likely to be breastfed.

The Mother-Baby Friendly Hospital Initiative Program of the Department of Health was launched in 1992 pursuant to RA 7600 otherwise known as the “Rooming-In and Breastfeeding Act of 1992”. To implement this Act, all hospitals, both government and private offering maternity and. newborn care services may be accredited as Mother-Baby Friendly by implementing the Ten Steps to Successful Breastfeeding which is a nationally adopted UNICEF/WHO global criteria.

The Mother-Baby Friendly Hospital Initiative (MBFHI) aims to facilitate and protect breastfeeding in private and public hospitals and help mothers and their newborns start with breastfeeding soon after birth. MBFHI in the Philippines reached a peak in the late nineties, when the Department of Health certiﬁed 1,427 or 83% of the 1,713 targeted hospitals and lying-in clinics.

However, MBFHI implementation weakened due to several factors. In 2006, a retrospective study conducted by the University of the Philippines (UP) on the Philippine MBFHI experience in 15 regions covering 98 government and private hospitals revealed poor compliance to the ten steps to successful breastfeeding. The study showed that while 92.9% of the participating hospitals sustained its accreditation, the breastfeeding policies were communicated only during orientation in 59.1% of respondents and during meetings in 42%.

Fifty-two percent (52%) of the participating hospitals had lactation coordinators. The survey showed that in only 63% were the mothers assisted in the initiation of breastfeeding Within half an hour of birth; while only 52% of post-partum mothers were assisted to breastfeed and maintain lactation. A signiﬁcant proportion of hospitals, 60.2%, allowed provision of milk formula in speciﬁc circumstances while only 43% of personnel did not allow food or drinks other than breastmilk.

A signiﬁcant number of the babies were provided non-breastmilk for the following reasons: mother is incapable of breastfeeding or is sick (35.7%); baby is sick (21.4%); mother refused to breastfeed (5.9%); doctor’s order (1.7%); baby had cleft palate (2.1%); mother delivered by Caesarean Section (1.7%); it is hospital routine to give water and sugar (1.3%). Only 27.6% of health facilities fostered the establishment of breastfeeding support groups.

As such, appropriate interventions and enabling mechanisms should be revitalized to protect, promote and support/sustain breastfeeding practices within health facilities.

Reassessment of previously certiﬁed hospitals need to be done, assess new ones and continue capacity building of health workers. There is a need to integrate mother—friendly indicators such as positioning during labor and delivery, initiation/skin to skin contact in vaginal/abdominal deliveries, minimal use of anesthesia and episiotomies, encourage spouse involvement and/or other family support to a woman before, during and after delivery. Likewise, addressing emerging issues affecting breastfeeding should also be considered.

This Administrative Order aims to guide heath workers in revitalizing the mother-baby friendly hospital initiative, towards a more sustainable action to protect, promote, and support breastfeeding.

II. LEGAL MANDATES

The following laws and administrative issuances provide the mandate for the appropriate support, promotion and protection of breastfeeding:

1. Executive Order No. 51 dated 20 October 1986, otherwise known as “National Code of Marketing of Breastmilk Substitutes, Breastmilk Supplements and Related Products” calls for the intensiﬁcation of the dissemination of information on breastfeeding and proper nutrition and the regulation of advertising, marketing, distribution of breastmilk substitutes and other related products including bottles and teats and prohibiting the use of health facilities and health workers in the promotion and marketing of the products covered by the Code.

2. Under Article 24 of the 1989, the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child emphasized the social responsibility of the member States to protect children and to provide them with appropriate support and services, emphasizing their right to the highest attainable level of health care services and guarantees the provision of and access to adequate nutrition for all infants and young children.

3. Republic Act 7600 otherwise known as the “Rooming-In and Breastfeeding Act” of 1992 provides that rooming-in shall be observed within 30 minutes after birth. For normal spontaneous deliveries, breastfeeding should be done within one hour after birth and for Caesarean Section (C/ S) deliveries, 3—4 hours after birth, to ensure support for early, exclusive and continuous breastfeeding.

4. The Philippine and Infant and Young Child Feeding (IYCF) policy as adopted from the WHO and UNICEF “2002 Global Strategy on Infant and Young Child Feeding” calls for a renewed and accelerated action towards the promotion of appropriate infant and young child feeding practices.

5. PHIC Circular No. 26 s.2005 has included the Mother-Baby Friendly Hospital Initiative as part of its accreditation requirements for all hospitals in order to encourage, support and promote breastfeeding in the primary, secondary and tertiary levels of hospital facilities recognizing that breastfeeding is essential for the health and well-being of the infant and the mother.

6. Administrative Order No. 2005—0023 of the Department of Health identiﬁed Fourmula One for Health as the implementing mechanism for health sector reforms, thereby ensuring better health outcomes, a more responsive public health system, and a more equitable health care ﬁnancing for Filipinos. This involves critical reform initiatives which focuses on F1 Health Priority Programs/Projects/Activities (PPA’s) for the National Investment Plan for Health, where the Breastfeeding Program is one of the priorities for Public Health Program Development.

III. OBJECTIVES

This Administrative Order aims to:

A. Transform all health institutions with maternity and newborn services in both the government and the private sector and other health facilities into facilities that fully protect, promote and support rooming-in, breastfeeding and mother-baby friendly practices.

B. Build the critical capacity and commitment of health care staff in protecting, promoting and providing support for appropriate infant and young child feeding practices.

C. Establish linkage with the primary health care facilities and community support groups to sustain the practice and ensure an enabling environment for optimal feeding practices.

IV. COVERAGE AND SCOPE

These guidelines shall, apply to all government, private and other health facilities nationwide providing maternity and newborn care services regardless of their current MBFHI certiﬁcation/accreditation status.

V. DEFINITION OF TERMS

A. Breastmilk substitute — means any food being marketed or otherwise represented as a partial or total replacement for breastmilk, Whether or not suitable for that purpose.
B. Complementary food — means any food, whether manufactured or locally prepared, suitable as a complement to breastmilk or to infant formula, when either becomes insufficient to satisfy the nutritional requirements of the infant. Such food is also commonly called “weaning food” or “breastmilk supplement”

G. Lactation Management — the general care of a mother-infant nursing couple during the mother’s prenatal, immediate post-partum and post-natal periods. It deals with educating and providing knowledge and information to pregnant and lactating mothers on the advantages of breastfeeding, the physmlogy of lactation, the establishment and maintenance of lactation, the proper care of the breasts and nipples, and such other matters that would contribute to successful breastfeeding.
H. Low birth weight infant — a newborn weighing less than two thousand ﬁve hundred (2,500) grams at birth.
I. Rooming-In — the practice of placing the newborn in the same room as the mother right after delivery up to discharge to facilitate mother-infant bonding and to initiate breastfeeding. The infant may either share the mother’s bed or be placed in a crib beside the mother.
J. Skilled birth attendant — refers to professional health workers such as doctor, nurse, midwife with the training or educational background to perform safe and clean deliveries.

VI. IMPLEMENTING GUIDELINES

In order to become a Mother-Baby Friendly facility, a set of criteria based on the current guidelines of the UNICEF/WHO have been developed and adopted locally for the purpose of setting the standards which shall be the basis for the requirements among others to be institutionalized through licensing, accreditation and other regulatory mechanisms in the pursuit of quality maternity and newborn care service. delivery in the hospital facilities.

A. To become a Mother-Friendly Institution, the following are the required steps to be followed by the health facilities according to the UNICEF/WHO Global Criteria: (See Annex A: Steps to a Mother-Friendly/ Safe Motherhood Initiative)

1. The hospital facility shall incorporate mother-friendly labor and birthing practices in the health facilities’ policies or standard operating procedures, including:

a. Clean birthing technique
b. Delayed cord clamping (3 minutes)
c. Placenta removal and disposal
d. Collaboration/consultation with other maternity services, including maintaining communication with all caregivers when referral or transfer is necessary
e. Linking the mother and the baby to appropriate community resources, including pre-natal and post-natal discharge follow-up and breastfeeding support

2. Train staff responsible on maternity services on essential and emergency obstetric and newborn care.

3. Educate the staff in non-drug methods of pain relief that can provide options in minimizing the use of analgesics or anesthetic drugs.

4. Motivate and refer pregnant women for STD/HIV/AIDS screening and voluntary counseling and treatment.

5. Provide the best available care, including quality antenatal, delivery, postpartum and newborn care with timely referral.

6. Birthing mothers may be offered access to a birth companion of her choice who can provide emotional and physical support during labor. A labor-support professional can provide this support until the mother delivers.

7. Birthing mothers may be allowed the freedom to walk, move about and assume the positions of her choice during labor and birth as a feasible option that shall not be limited to the lithotomy position.

8. Women may be allowed to drink during labor, upon the discretion of the attending physician.

9. The performance of obstetrical procedures shall be rationalized to minimize or avoid unnecessary procedures and instrumentation that may inhibit breastfeeding. A baby born by Caesarean Section is less likely to have early skin to skin contact and more likely to have nursery care increasing the risk of cross infection as well as restricting breastfeeding. The option to perform invasive procedures such as rupture of membranes, episiotomies, acceleration or induction of labor, instrumental deliveries or caesarean section speciﬁcally required for a complication shall be governed by implementing guidelines to be set by the National Management Committee based on the Global criteria on mother friendly care.

10. Encourage all mothers and families with sick premature newborns or infants with congenital problems, to touch, cuddle, breastfeed and care for their babies to the extent compatible with their condition.

11. Encourage postpartum mothers to have at least two postpartum visits.

o Support group
- other hospital personnel ready or available to assist and counsel the mother to be successful in breastfeeding or a peer counselor from among the successful breastfeeding mothers

Working mothers need a supportive environment. Employers must give due consideration in adjusting work schedules of breastfeeding mothers such that those working on “shift” basis shall be assigned on a morning schedule.

Women in paid employment can be helped to continue breastfeeding by being provided with the minimum enabling conditions such as paid maternity leave, part-time work arrangements, on-site créches, day-care facilities or facilities for expressing and storing breastmilk and paid breastfeeding breaks. Mothers should be able to continue breastfeeding and care for their infants after they return to paid employment

ANNEX B

TEN STEPS TO SUCCESSFUL BREASTFEEDING

1. Develop a written breastfeeding policy that translates all the Ten Steps to Successful Breastfeeding and protects breastfeeding by adhering to the Philippine Milk Code (EC. 51) and the Rooming-In and Breastfeeding Act (RA. 7600) which should be communicated to all health workers. This written policy should be posted in areas where there are mother and baby dyad translated in the local dialectl language common to all.

2. Train all health care staff in skills necessary to implement the policy on breastfeeding.

o All health care staff in-charge of mother and infant care shall be trained on lactation management which includes the Ten Steps to Successful Breastfeeding and the Milk Code. The training conducted should be properly documented (training syllabus, training plan, attendance sheets).
o All new hospital staff shall receive training within six months upon entrance to duty
o Non-clinical staff shall be provided with skills needed to support mothers to successfully breastfeed their infants
o Train hospital staff in breastfeeding and lactation management to enable them to provide assistance to all mothers, breast care for mothers with babies in special care and demonstrate to mothers the correct positioning, attachment, how to hand express, collect, store and give their expressed breastmilk.

3. Provide information to all pregnant women about the beneﬁts and management of breastfeeding.

During pro-natal services, pregnant women shall receive information on breastfeeding such as:

o Importance of exclusive breastfeeding for six (6) months
o Beneﬁts of breastfeeding
o Basic breastfeeding management
o Importance of skin-to—skin contact, early initiation, rooming-in, on-demand feeding, exclusive breastfeeding for six (6) months and to continue breastfeeding with appropriate complementary feeding for two years and beyond
o The risk of artiﬁcial feeding
o Information on the effects of the use of anesthetics, sedatives and analgesics on breastfeeding

4. Practice rooming-in to allow mothers and infants to be together 24 hours a day. Start rooming-in the baby with the mother immediately after birth. For mothers who have had caesarean section, the baby shall be roomed-in within 3 to 4 hours or earlier as soon as the mother is fully awake.

5. Help others initiate breastfeeding within one hour after birth for normal spontaneous deliveries and 3-4 hours after birth for Caesarean Section (C/S) deliveries.

Place babies in skin-to—skin contact with their mothers immediately following birth or at least an hour for babies delivered vaginally or by caesarean section as soon as the mothers are responsive and alert. Mothers are helped to recognize the signs that their babies are ready to breastfeed and offered help if needed. Such signs of readiness to breastfeed include: rooting, smacking of lips, placing hands to mouth, sucking on ﬁngers or hands, mouth opening in response to tactile stimulation. For babies in special care unit, their mothers are also encouraged to hold them.

6. Show mothers how to breastfeed and how to maintain lactation, if they become separated from their infants.

7. Encourage breastfeeding on demand.

Breastfeed the babies as often and for as long as the baby wants. Mothers can recognize signs of hunger and can appropriately respond to the needs of her baby.

8. Give newborn infants no food or drink other than breastmilk, unless medically indicated.

Ensure that all babies receive no food or drink other than breastmilk from birth to discharge unless there are acceptable medical conditions (galactosemia, phenylketonuria and maple-syrup urine disease). The facility shall not display or distribute any materials on breastmilk substitutes, scheduled feeds or other inappropriate feeding practices.

9. Give no artiﬁcial teats or paciﬁers to breastfeeding infants.

Inform mothers of the risks in using artiﬁcial teats and paciﬁers and ensure that these are not available in the facility.

10. Foster the establishment of breastfeeding support groups and refer mothers to them on discharge from the hospital or clinic.

Link with breastfeeding support groups and other community services that can provide breastfeeding support to mothers discharged from the health facilities. Provide IEC materials on breastfeeding to mothers before discharge.
