<subject>SUBJECT: Standard Procurement System in the Regional Health Offices and District Health Offices of NCR of the Department of Health</subject>

<body>

RATIONALE

With the decentralization of most procurement to the Regional Health Offices (RHO), there is a need for a standard and strengthened procurement system for goods and services in the different Regional Field Offices of the Department of Health. This is to avoid varied and sometimes conflicting processes and to attain the following objectives:

1. to purchase goods of acceptable quality at fair and reasonable price from qualified and capable suppliers/manufacturers/distributors who deliver on time and satisfactorily comply with all contract terms and conditions;

2. to procure services such as janitorial, security, repair maintenance, catering, venue and accommodation and other contractual services from reputable and dependable institutions and establishments;

3. to secure the services of qualified and competent contractors to undertake health non—infrastructure projects; and

4. to facilitate monitoring of procurement processes.

Towards this end, the following guidelines are hereby issued to govern the conduct of the procurement system for goods and services for the above-mentioned units of the Department:

2.4 An accountant/budget officer will be part of RBAC and shall undertake financial, statements analysis

2.5 A Food and Drugs Regulations Officer (FDRO) should act as a permanent member of RPBAC for drugs and medicines.

2.6 The RPBAC shall be responsible for the procurement of goods. The mode of procurement they shall apply will be based by E.O. 302 s. 1996 and its IRR:

2.5.1. Public Bidding — As a general rule, awards of contracts shall be done after open competitive bidding unless a more apprOpriate method has been duly approved for adoption. Further, in line with the COA Resolutions No. 95-244, public bidding may be dispensed with for purchases of supplies, materials and equipment in an amount up to P10,000,000 as long as the purchase is most advantageous to the government. All purchases exceeding P50 million pesos shall pass through the Office of the President for clearance.

2.5.2 Alternative Methods of Procurement

2.5.2.1. Limited Source Bidding (selective bidding) — is a procedure that involves direct invitation to bid by the
concerned agency from a set of pre—selected manufacturers/suppliers or distributors with known experience and proven
capability on the requirements of the particular contract. The PBAC of the concerned agency shall directly send to the pre-selected bidders the invitation to bid, which shall already indicate the relevant information required to enable the bidders to prepare their bids as prescribed under the pertinent provisions of EO 302 IRR. Limited Source Bidding may be employed by the concerned agencies under any of the following conditions:  

a) procurement of highly specialized types of equipment where only a few manufacturers/distributors are available who could maintain a competitive position, such that resorting to open competitive bidding method will not likely result in additional manufacturers suppliers/distributors participating in the bidding;

b) procurement of relatively small additions to an existing fleet of equipment where a few manufacturers/suppliers/distributors are well—established and who can provide satisfactory after—sales services;

c) procurement of major plant component where it is deemed advantageous to limit the bidding to known qualified bidders in order to maintain uniform quality and performance of the plant as a whole; and

d) procurement of goods involving relatively small amounts, i.e., amounts involving P500,000 or less, such that the cost and the time of publicly advertising the bidding is not justifiable.

2.5.2.2. Direct Contracting (single source procurement) — procurement does not require elaborate bidding documents. The selected manufacturers/suppliers/distributors is simply asked to submit a price quotation or a pro-forma invoice together with the conditions of sale. The offer may be accepted immediately or after some negotiations. Direct contracting may be resorted to by agencies under any of the following conditions: 

a) procurement of items of proprietary in nature which can be obtained only from the proprietary source, i.e., when patent, trade secrets and copyright prohibits others from manufacturing the same items;

b) those sold by an exclusive dealer or manufacturer which does not have sub-dealers selling at lower price and for
which no other suitable substitute can be obtained at most advantageous terms to the government;

c) when the procurement of critical plant components from a specialist manufacturers/suppliers/distributors serves as a pre-condition of a contractor, responsible for the erection of the project for his guarantee of project performance;

d) for purposes of maintaining standards such as purchases involving a small addition to an already existing fleet of equipment; and 

e) in emergencies where procurement must be immediately accomplished regardless of cost. Emergencies shall be defined as those situations where there is imminent danger to life and/or property as determined by the head of agency concerned.

2.5.2.3. Repeat Order — under this method, acquisition is made on additional quantities from the manufacturers/suppliers/distributors who provided the same items under a previously bidded contract. Repeat order may be resorted to by agencies only in cases where the manufacturer/supplier/distributor who was selected in the previous bidding is clearly superior to the other bids not only in terms of the price quoted but also in terms of equipment reliability, availability of spare parts, after—sales service and delivery period, among others. Repeat order shall likewise be subject to the following conditions:

a) price must be the same or lower than those in the original contract; 

b) the repeat order will not resort in splitting of requisition or purchase order;

c) repeat order may be availed of only within the six month period from the date of the original purchase; and

d) the repeat order shall not exceed the quantity in the original contract.

2.5.2.4. Shopping - is a method of procurement whereby the purchaser simply requests for the submission of price quotations for the goods to be procured directly from manufacturers/supplies/distributors of known qualifications.

This method of procurement shall be employed only in the following cases, and to ensure competitive prices, the PBAC concerned shall obtain quotations from at least three (3) manufacturers/suppliers/distributors; 

a) procurement of readily available off—shelf goods or standard specifications, goods that are small in value, i.e., amounts involving P500,000 or less; 
b) procurement of ordinary/regular office supplies and equipment involving an amount not to exceed P500,000. At the discretion of the head of agency concerned, the procurement of ordinary/regular Office supplies and equipment involving an amount not exceeding P500,000 may be handled by the respective administrative staff/division of the agency instead of the PBAC.

2.5.2.5. Negotiated Procurement — As distinguished from the direct contracting, negotiated procurement is resorted to only for
convenience rather than anything else, even if broader tendering would have been possible. Negotiated procurement may be employed by agencies only in the following cases as determined by the head of agency concerned:

a) where there has been a failure of competitive bidding for the second time;
b) where the existing contract has been terminated in accordance with the pertinent provisions of EO302 IRR and existing law, rules and regulations;
c) whenever the purchases is to be made from another agency of the government. One special negotiated procurement scheme which government agencies may consider is the procurement through the Procurement Service of the Department of Budget and Management. Such mode of procurement should, however, conform to Executive Order No. 359 which prescribes the guidelines in the implementation of Executive order No. 285 regarding the operation of a government—wide procurement system for common-use office supplies, materials and other equipment.

3. TECHNICAL EVALUATION COMMITTEE (TEC)

A TEC under the RPBAC shall be created to:

1. review specifications on requisitioned items. In cases when the expertise is not available at the RHO, central offices’ or external experts shall be consulted in the drawing of specification.
