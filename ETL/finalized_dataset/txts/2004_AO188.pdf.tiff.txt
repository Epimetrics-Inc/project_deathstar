<subject>Subject: Implementation Guidelines for the Phase II of the Support to the Philippine Health Sector Reform and Population Management Programs (GTZ)</subject>

<body>
I. Rationale

The Philippine German Cooperation Program (GTZ) entitled, "Support to the Philippine Health Sector Reform and Population Management Programs" has completed its first phase of implementation (formerly called: Unified GTZ Support to the Philippine Health Sector). A program review was carried out by a team composed of DOH, Philhealth and external evaluators to assess the achievements of the program, identify areas for improvement, and offer recommendations for enhancing the program's performance and strengthening the impact of its intended objectives in a second phase of four years.

In the previous structure (2001-2004), there were four (4) main components: a) Local Health Development Component, b) Family/Reproductive Health, (c) Social Health Insurance, (d) Pharmaceuticals.

A new framework for German Development Cooperation (AURA) presents a sharpened focus on program impact and an amended role of the GTZ from being a contributor to being co-equal with partners (DOH, Philhealth, POPCOM) in the responsibility for achieving the program objectives. Corollary to this framework, GTZ will sign an agreement with the Philippine partners (DHO, PHIC, POPCOM) that will embody the implementing arrangements.

Based on the AURA challenge of program responsibility and impact, a revision of the current program structure was proposed and agreed upon. The program's result areas or deliverables were consolidated under two major components: 1) Policy support component, and 2) Local health systems development component. The proposed structure for 2004-2008, needs to further increase the synergy among the components, focus of GTZ support and make it more responsive to central level policy needs.
