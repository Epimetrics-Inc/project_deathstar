SUBJECT: Guidelines for the DOH-PITC Expanded Drug Access Pilot Program using Convenience Stores as BNB Express Outlets</subject>


<body>
I. RATIONALE

The 1987 Philippine Constitution mandates the right of every Filipino to health. The State, under Section II of Article Xlll, shall adopt an “integrated and comprehensive approach to health development which shall endeavor to make essential goods, health and other social services available to all the people at affordable cost".

Republic Act No. 6675 also known as the Generics Act of 1988, prescribes that it is the policy of the State to “ensure the adequate supply of drugs with generic name at the lowest possible cost”.

To promote equity in health, the Botika ng Barangay program was established to ensure the availability and accessibility of affordable, safe and effective, quality essential drugs to the public, with priority for the marginalized, underserved, critical and hard to reach areas. Such endeavor was developed as early as 1996 as embodied in Administrative Order 23-A s. 1996 entitled, “Guidelines on the Development and Establishment of Botika ng Barangay (BnB)”. This was further strengthened by Administrative Order 144 s. 2004, entitled, “Guidelines for the Establishment of Botika ng Barangays (BnBs) and Pharmaceutical Distribution Networks (PDN)” as part of the initiatives of the Half—Priced Medicines Program.

In line with the framework of FOURmula One for Health (F1) in providing equity in health, responsive health systems and better health outcomes, and in pursuit of strengthening the Botika ng Barangay framework, the Philippine International Trading Corporation (PITC), in collaboration with DOH, shall institute an innovative strategy that will-ensure the accessibility and availability of quality essential drugs through the expansion of its distribution network using qualified Botika ng Bayan outlets nationwide. Mindful of the intentions of Administrative Order 144 s. 2004, the DOH and PITC shall implement the Expanded Drug Access Program using traditional convenience stores as BNB Express Outlets. The PITC shall be in charge of identifying and accrediting these convenience stores that will offer for sale medicines available in Botika ng Barangay. Said BNB Express Outlets shall be under the supervision of PlTC’s Botika ng Bayan.

The DOH in turn, intends to provide inter-agency technical assistance to PITC to synergize current strategies in bringing down the cost of medicines and in enhancing drug access.

ll. SCOPE
This Order shall only be applicable to all Botika ng Bayan (BNB) outlets identified by PITC acting as distribution networks as well as to all PITC-accredited and licensed convenience stores that shall be known as BNB Express outlets.
