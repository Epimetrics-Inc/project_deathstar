I. RATIONALE: 

Executive Order No. 197 series of 2000 was issued reiterating the importance of revising the rates of fees and charges and directing all departments, bureaus, commissions, agencies, ofﬁces and instrumentalities of the National Government, including government—owned controlled corporations, to increase their fees and charges by not less than 20 percent (20%). 

Pursuant to the above authority, Administrative Order No. 50 s. 2001 and Administrative Order No. 134 s. 2002 (Amendment to the Revised 2001 Schedule of Fees and Charges of BFAD for Food Manufacturers) were issued and are still the bases for the Food and Drug Administration in charging fees for services rendered. Eleven years have passed since the time of the promulgation of such schedule of fees and charges applicable to FDA and the same has not been adjusted or amended to Cover new regulated activities. In contrast and with the passage and adoption of new laws and policies for FDA to implement, among others, Republic Act No. 9502 or the Cheaper Medicines Act of 2008 and the more recent Republic Act No. 9711 or the FDA Act of 2009, the establishments, health products and activities being regulated by the FDA have more than doubled thereby immensely expanding the regulatory function or control of the FDA over such establishments, products and activities. As such, the aforesaid Administrative Order do not reﬂect the charges for new regulated activities such as the Accreditation of Private Testing Laboratories and the Audit and Inspection. On the other hand, the existing rates of fees for the accreditation of Bioequivalence Testing Centers and lnSpection are too low and are not commensurate to fulﬁll the regulatory function over these very technical and highly scientific activities. lndisputably, the fees and charges of the FDA that have been in place since 2001 is deemed no longer commensurate for FDA to undertake services and other operational requirement to perform such very technical and scientiﬁc evaluations. 

Thus, for FDA to effectively implement the laws it is tasked to enforce and to fulﬁll its regulatory function or coverage and control over establishments and products under its jurisdiction and pursuant to Republic Act No. 97] 1 expressly authorizing the 


FDA to initiate the annual determination and review of authorization and other fees, as well as determination and constitution of additional fees such as sale of publication and services, assessment fees, ﬁnes, penalties and other fees and charges outside the usual licensing and registration fees, to be known as “other regulated fees”, the FDA undertook the review of its existing schedule of fees and charges. 

Now therefore, pursuant to the above express powers provided by law, the imperativeness to update the existing fees and charges implemented by the FDA, and after complying with the requirements of public consultation, this Order is hereby issued to cover the fees and charges for the accreditation of bioequivalence testing centers and private testing laboratories, as well as, audits and inspection and to further amend Administrative Order No. 50 s. 2001. 

II. OBJECTIVE 

This Administrative Order is issued to prescribe the corresponding schedule of fees for the services rendered by the FDA on matters pertaining to accreditation of bioequivalence testing centers and private testing laboratories, as well as, audits and inspections in order for the persons or establishments receiving the services for which the fees are imposed to be made to share the burden of the expenses incurred by the government in relation to the regulation of products and establishments within its jurisdiction.
