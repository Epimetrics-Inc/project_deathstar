<subject>SUBJECT: Guidelines for the Adoption of More Efficient and Effective Development, Approval, and implementation of PlPH/AOP under FOURmula One for Health</subject>


<body>
I. BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE 

The nationwide rollout of implementation of FOURmula One (F1) to 81 F1 sites requires a more efficient process for development, approval and implementation of Province— wide Investment Plans for Health (PIPH) and its Annual Operational Plans (AOP). Fast tracking F1 reforms under a Sectoral Development Approach (SDAH) for Health will accelerate achievement of Millenium Development Goals (MDG) in the country. 

Resources and energies for F1 must be maximized. Various procedural delays experienced in the development, approval and implementation of PIPH and AOPs in the country must be addressed. Specific areas for improvement are seen in (i) Complex and confusing instructions and guidelines for PIPH development , (ii) very centralized management of pr'ocesses from DOH Central Office and SDAH partners, (iii) duplication of transactions for approving ADP and SLA, (iv) repetitive review process at various levels , and (v) low fund utilization of (40-50%) emanating from various delays and many restrictions on the release of funds for Province-wide Health Systems (PWHS) to initiate implementation of their PlPl-i.
