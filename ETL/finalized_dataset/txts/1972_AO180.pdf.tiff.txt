<docnum>No. 180 s. 1972</docnum>

<subject>SUBJECT : Amending in part Administrative Order No. 165, current series, by making the submission and preparation of TEVs chargeable vs. the DOH/RHU Family Planning Project Funds on bi-monthly basis.</subject>

<body>
Effective January, 1973, vouchers for travelling allowances being charged against the Family Planning project funds by field personnel authorized to claim such allowances as provided in the Sub-Agreement between the Commission on Population and the National Comprehensive NCH-Family Planning Project Office, this Department, will be submitted on a bi-monthly basis, that is, once every two (2) months.

This amends in part Administrative Order No. 165,s. 1972, requiring the completion of such claims at the end of every month and their submission tothe Provincial Health Office not later than the 2nd day of the succeeding month.

Henceforth, the following schedule should be followed in the sybmission of TEVs by those concerned:

Claims covered by this order are the TEVs of the authorized field personnel of the Rural Health and Family Planning Centers involved in the family planning program, the Regional as well as the Provincial Health Offices' Staff Members who are all specified in the abovementioned Sub-Agreement.

It is therefore understood that except for the foregoing expences, all other claims from the family planning project funds including the payroll for the Motivators' Incentive Pay will, as usual, be submitted monthly. TEVs not submitted on time in accordinance with the above prescribed schedule will not be entertained. Consequently, delays may mean forfeiture of claims. This scheme is expected to relieve the backlog and congestion of paper work which the monthly system of submissionand preparationof TEVs has brought about, and to reduce by one-half the working time involved since what used to be done monthly will now be system payment of travelling allowance will not only be facilitated but also axpedited.

Please be guided accordingly.
