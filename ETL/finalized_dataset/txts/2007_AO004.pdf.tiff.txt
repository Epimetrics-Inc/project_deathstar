I. Rationale

Tobacco use is the second major cause of death in the world. It is currently responsible for the death of one in ten adults, which is about 5 million deaths each year, a number that will double by year 2020 if nothing is done. If current consumption pattern persist, about 1 billion people in the 21St century will be killed by their addiction to tobacco, with 300 million deaths in the Western Pacific Region alone. Report from the WHO stated that there is as much as 3.4 percent annual increase in the number of people smoking in developing countries. One-third of the world’s total male population smokes cigarettes.

The 2005 — 2006 Tobacco and Poverty Study in the Philippines, a collaborative effort by the World Health Organization (WHO). Department of Health (DOH) and University of the Philippines — Manila (UP—Manila) showed the following: Sixty four percent of the poorest monthly expenditure is food followed by other expenses. Tobacco comprise 2.5% of their monthly expenditure has a bigger share than clothing (23%), education (1.4%) and health (0.9%). When only those poorest households with tobacco expenditure were considered, the household tobacco expenditure ($16) is almost 16 times as much as the per capita monthly expense on health, eleven times as much for education, seven times as much for clothing and twice as much as for housing. The total per capita expenditure of clothing, housing, health and education is only $1.3, which is even lower than the monthly household expenditure on cigarettes alone.

According to the 2003-2004 National Nutrition and Health Survey (NNHS) conducted by the Food and Nutrition Research Institute of the Department of Science and Technology (FNRI-DOST), 35 out of 100 Filipinos (34.8 percent) are smokers. Despite the concerted anti-smoking campaigns of the DOH and other medical organizations, adult male smokers even increased from 53.8 percent in 1998 to 56.3 percent in 2003. The prevalence for adult female smokers has slightly decreased from 12.6 percent in 1998 to 12.1 percent in 2003.

The Global Youth Tobacco Survey reported that there are approximately four in 10 students aged 13-15 years (42.8 percent in 2000 and 14.9 percent in 2003) in the Philippines who ever smoked cigarettes, i.e., even one or two puffs. It was also found out that adolescent boys were significantly more likely to have ever smoked than adolescent girls. About one in eight students who had ever smoked took their first Cigarette before 10 years of age.

The spread of the tobacco epidemic is facilitated by a variety of complex factors with cross-border effects, such as trade liberalization, foreign direct investment and other activities such as global marketing, transnational tobacco advertising, promotion and sponsorship and the international movement of contraband and counterfeit cigarettes. In response to the tobacco epidemic, the Philippines passed the landmark legislation, RA. 9211 othenrvise known as the Tobacco Regulatory Act of 2003. It regulates the package use, sale and distribution and advertisements of tobacco products. And it also embodies the promotion of healthy environments, creation of health programs and withdrawal clinics (section 33). Moreover, the passage of Republic Act 9334 focuses on the increase of excise tax rates of tobacco products. Furthermore, Article 13, section 11 of the 1987 Philippine Constitution enjoins the state to protect and promote the right to health of every Filipino by making quality and adequate health care available and accessible especially the under privileged. This entails the adoption of an integrated and comprehensive approach to health development, implying a multi-sectoral partnership and multi-level health care delivery system.

Globally, country negotiations were done under the auspices of the WHO to develop the Framework Convention on Tobacco Control, the first public health treaty passed ever. The FCTC is an evidence-based treaty that reaffirms the right of all people to the highest standard of health and was developed in response to the current globalization of the tobacco epidemic. On September 23, 2003 the Philippines became a signatory to the FCTC and on February 22, 2005 the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations filed Resolution No. 195 concurring in the ratification of the FCTC.

Being a party to the WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco Control (FCTC), it is mandated that parties should provide a framework for tobacco control measures to be implemented at the National, regional and local levels (FCTC, Article 3). Furthermore, under the WHO Western Pacific Region Action for Tobacco Control for 2005-2009, member states are directed to attain ratification of the WHO FCTC in all Western Pacific Region, strengthen national capacity for tobacco control to enable implementation of comprehensive tobacco control strategies in an effective and sustainable manner, develop and formally adopt measures to ensure sustainability of tobacco control programs in all WPR member states.

Thus, this National Tobacco Prevention and Control Program is hereby formulated. It shall set directions as to how the prevention and control of tobacco related diseases will be implemented in a comprehensive, systematic, integrated and holistic manner. Similarly, this program shall complement and build upon existing initiatives in the country.
