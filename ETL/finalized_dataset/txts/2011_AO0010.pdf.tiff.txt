<subject>SUBJECT: Implementing Procedures and Guidelines in Reporting Field Health Services Data to the DOH Central Ofﬁce </subject>


<body>
I. RATIONALE 

The Field Health Services Information System (FHSIS) is a major component of the network of information sources developed by the Department of Health (DOH) to enable it to better manage its nationwide health service delivery activities and provide the desired management information. It focuses on the programs of the DOH public health services, namely Maternal and Child Health, Expanded Program on Immunization, Control of Diarrheal Diseases, Nutrition, Family Flaming, Maternal Care, Tuberculosis, -Malaria, Schistosomiasis, Leprosy, Dental Health and Environmental Health. ' 

FHSIS was ﬁrst conceptualized in 1987 as a response to the need for streamlining an existing manual reporting system that was burdensome and time consuming. The computerization of the data entry and submission of data for FHSIS started in 1988, and in 2008 has undergone several improvements and/or simpliﬁcations to become responsive and relevant to the end users. Through consultative workshops, the weaknesses in the system have been recognized and addressed to further strengthen the FHSIS. The existing version of the FHSIS software is a stand-alone system, now named as AggreSys, that captures aggregated values or numbers which are totaled by the reporting health facilities, submitted to the next hierarchy of reporting system and consolidated accordingly. Thus, consolidated reports by municipality, provincial, regional and national can be generated from the system. 

The use of internet in reporting data has provided several beneﬁts, e.g. improved accuracy or validity of data, timeliness in submission, ease of access, and availability. Thus, the Department of Health (DOH) has utilized the capabilities of internet to develop web- based systems to address the issues on accuracy, reliability or validity of data, and the timeliness of submission. Two (2) web-based systems were added to the existing FHSIS, I i.e. the OnlineSys and UploadSys. The OnlineSys is a web-based system of reporting ﬁeld health services data. On the other hand, data entered using AggreSys shall be electronically uploaded to the DOH Central Ofﬁce via the UploadSys. 

These systems were added to increase the success rate of submission or reporting of data to the DOH Central Ofﬁce. Different situations exist in health facilities particularly on the availability of computers, internet connection, operating budget, and human resources. These problems on resources are also being addressed by the DOH in coordination with the local government units. Thus, it is targeted that in year 2012, all of these concerns are resolved accordingly. 

This Order deﬁnes the procedures and guidelines in the reporting of ﬁeld health services data using AggreSys, UploadSys and OnlineSys to ensure that data are successfully submitted to the DOH Central Ofﬁce. 

II. OBJECTIVES 

The general objective of this Order is to provide clear guidance and direction in the implementation of AggreSys, UploadSys and OnlineSys. Detailed objectives are as follows: 

1. Establish procedures on data reporting, data validation, report generation, data analysis, data utilization, and other relevant protocols.

<image>table_4.png</image>
 
b. A health facility can select the system which is appropriate to the current setting or situation in the facility. - 

c. The standard recording forms at the barangay health stations and'rural health units are the Individual Treatment Records, Target Client Lists, Summary Tables and Monthly Consolidation Tables (Annex 4.0 — Standard Reporting Forms). 

d. In a situation where a health facility cannot really use any of the systems, data can be manually totaled, written down on standard summary reports, and submitted to the next hierarchy of reporting (i.e. City Health Ofﬁce, Provincial Health Ofﬁce or Center for Health Development Ofﬁce). The CHO, PHO or CHD shall enter all the data submitted on standard summary reports. The monthly data consolidation shall be by barangay level.
