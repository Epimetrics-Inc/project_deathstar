<subject>SUBJECT: Guidelines for Implementing Tuberculosis Control Program in Children</subject>


<body>

I. RATIONALE

The coverage of the National Tuberculosis Control Program since it started in 1987 was to detect and cure tuberculosis cases among the 10 years old and above. Priority was given among this age group becauSe they‘are highly communicable.

An adult in the immediate household Usually infects children. In the Philippines, in 77% of children admitted in the hospitals, the usual source of infection was either the mother or the father. In 13%, another family member was the source or infection. Therefore, abOut 90% of tuberculosis infections in children occurred in the family.

The National Prevalence Survey done in 1997 by Tupasi et al showed that the prevalence of infection in 0-4 years old is, 6.9% and 16% in ages 5-9.years-old. From these infections, only 5% will develop active TB. One can therefore esitimate that approximately 1,500,000 children (0-9 years) are infected and 40,000 of them develop the disease each year.

The risk of being infected as well as the risk of developing the disease depends on the number of factors: age of the occurrence of the primary infection, the nutritional status of the child and the intensity of the contact. Infants and very young children develop the disseminated hematogenous forms of tuberculosis more often than the older children or adults. The highest mortality rate occurs in children ages 0-4 years.

Tuberculosis in children is not easin diagnosed. This is because children with tuberculosis rarely produce bacteriologically positive specimen and do not present the physical signs and symptoms of the disease especially in the. initial stage. It is also inﬂuenced by the limited diagnostic tools.

Because of existing cases, the difficulty in the diagnosis and the presence of several groups (that are interested of the welfare of the children, the need to implement a tuberculosis control program among children, was realized.

These guidelines prescribe the management of TB in children employing the DOTS strategy. This strategy has proven to have dramatically improved the cure rate of TB patients to more than 85% in areas where it has been implemented; These guidelines, may be updated in accordance with the results of the evaluation of the implementation of tuberculosis in children in the pilot areas.

III. COVERAGEAND SCOPE

These guidelines shall apply to all health facilities, agencies and organizations that will
implement TuberculoSis control Program-1n children

IV. GENERAL GUIDELINES
A. Management of children with TB

. 1. Prevention I

In accordanCe with ‘the policies and procedures of the Expanded Program. on

Immunization, BCG‘vaccination' shall be- given to all infants. The BCG vaccine is

' moderately effective. It has a protective efﬁcacy of 50% against any TB disease, 64%
against TB meningitis and 71% against death from TB. _

_ 2. Casefinding

a- Cases of TB in children are reported and. identiﬁed in two instances
' i. The patient sought censultation, was screened and was found to have signs
and symptoms of TB. .
The patient was reported to have been exposed to an adult TB patient.

' b. '~All TB symptomatic children 0-9 years old, except the sputum positive child
' I shall be subjeoted to Tubereulin testing.
‘ 1. Only a trained Public Health Nurse or the main health center midwife
_ trained as alternate shall do. tuberoulin testing and reading. -
' ii. Tuberculin testing and reading shall be conducted once a week either on-
Monday or on Tuesday. Ten children 'shall be gathered for testing to avoid
wastage. . _

c. A patient shall be suspected as having TB and Will be considered as a TB
'1 symptomatic if With any three of the folloiving signs. and symptoms:
i. Cough/wheezing of 2 Weeks or more
ii. Unexplained fever of 2 Weeks or more

' iii. .Loss of welgh’rffailure to gain weight! weight faltering/loss of appetite
' - iv; Failure to respond to 2 weeks of. apprdpriate antibiotic therapy for lower
. -. respiratory tract infection '

' " 'v,‘IFa11ure to regain previOus state of health 2 weeks after a viral infection or

' ._ exanthem (e. g. measles) ‘ '

 

d. 'A child shall be clinically diagnosed or conﬁrmed of having TB if he has any
"three cfthe following conditions: '
' ’ " i. Positive history of expos'ure to an adult/adolescent TB case-
lii. Presence of signs andsymptoms suggestive of TB
iii. Positive Tuberculin Test. " _ " - .'
iv. Abnormal Chest x—ray suggestive of TB
v. Laboratory ﬁndings suggestive or indicative of TB

. However, biological demonstration of TB bacilli in the smear/culture makes a conﬁrmatory
diagnosis of TB in children. Thus with this continuation alone, the child will be labeled as having
TB disease and Tuberculin testing shall no lenger be performed. '

_ e. For Children with. positive exposure to TB

- i. A child who had exposure to‘an adult TB patient (who is also registered in
the NTP" registry)'_ shall undergo physical examination and tuberculin
testing. _ "' '_ 5 t '- . ' — .

‘ ii. A child wi .h-productive cough shall be referred for sputum examination. If

‘ - found'positive, treatment shall be started immediately. tuberculin testing

shall no: longer be, performed. - . - . '

~ f iii-Childrenwithout signs and symptoms of TB but with positive tuberculin .
”ﬁrst, and thosewith- symptoms but with negative tuberculin test shall be
' referred-for chest x—ray, examination. ' " ' '

f._For.chi_ldren with signs and symptoms of TB

- - . - i. A child with symptoms and with either known or unknown exposure to a
' ' TB case shall' be referred for Tuberculin test. (Those with unknown
exposure; the suspected adult. source shall be advised to undergo work-up
'_. follctving the ‘NTP guidelines for adults).
'ii.-' Children with known contact but with negative Tuberculin test and those
with'unknown contact but-with positive Tuberculin test shall be referred for
chest x-ray eXamination‘.’ .2. ' ' - -'

_ after three-months. ' __ - ' ‘ , . -_ ‘
iv. Chemoprophylaxis of __iNH__for three months shall be given to children less

than ﬁve years-oldgwith negative chest x—ray; after which, tuberculin test
shall be repeated. i-However, chemoprophy‘laxis shall only be followed if

- ' .' adequate resources are available. - . ' ' -

3. Caseholding and Treatment ' '
a. CaseholdingMechanism
_' ._ _ Directly observed treatment is; one element of the DOTS strategy of the WHO
recommended policy package for TB: control. This element shall be the mechanism
' employed to provide support to_-TB patients solthat they will be motivated to regularly take
their drugs daily: for 6 fro—8. months. .-
' Direct'observation-Ior treatment meansthat'a- treatment partner observes the patient

, ~ takes his drugs daily. ThisenSures that the patient takes the right drugs and in the right dose.

4

 

All. patients shall undergo supervised treatment. The treatment partner shall
preferably be the health worker, or any member of the community such as the barangay
health worker, local government ofﬁcial or a former TB patient. Family members shall be
the last priority as treatment partner's, ,

D. O. T. shall preferably he done at the health facility. If the patient lives far from the .
health facility, the D. O .T. may be done at the house .of the volunteer health worker. The
_ I health worker should be knowledgeable 1n managing adverse reactions to the drugs.

The treatment shall be done 1111-5111 months and the treatment partner shall ensure
that the child 1s supervised daily for six months.

7 The following are the policies regarding treatment of children with tuberculosis

. '1;

Short course regimen with at least 3 anti-TB drugs fer 2 months during
the intensive phase and 2 anti—TB drugs for 4 months during the

maintenance phase shall be the mode of treatment for pulmonary TB

. cases. If there 1s no resolution of symptoms after six months of treatment,
. the mainmnance phase shall be extended for 3 months. For extra-

'. pulmonary TB cases, e. g. TB meningitis, TB lymphadenopathy, TB
"~ efﬁlsions- and spinal TB, treatment regimen is composed of 4 anti—TB

_ . drugs for 2' months during the intensive phase and 2 anti—TB drugs for 10

ii.

menths during the maintenance phase.‘

Domiciliary treatment shall be the preferred mode of care.

_ iii; No patients shall be initiated into treatment unless the patient and health

worker has agreed upon a- case holding mechanism for treatment

' - compliance.I

. iv..-
and; the dose shall. be adjusted to the weight of the child. While on .

All diagnosed TB cases shall be treated based on the following regimen-

(1.- Breastfeeding
Breastfeeding 13 not IdiSCoura'ged 111' mothers taking anti-TB drugs since low
concentrations of the drugs 1n breastmilk do not produce toxicity in the nursing newborn. In
addition, only minimal amounts of the drugs are ingested by the infant.
I The American Family Phy‘siCians (APP) recommends that lactaing mothers
- should feed their infants before taking med1cat1ons

' B. Recording and Reporting

. There are ﬁve recdrds to be maintained by the health workers at the health facility
and two quarterly reports to be submitted to the Provincial/City health Ofﬁces, Center for
Health Development and the Central Ofﬁce.-

The following records 111111111111 maintained at the health facility:-
. 1.Masterlist of suspected Child with TB— This Is a listing of all children suspected
of having tuberculosis identified through contact with adults or through consultation. This '
gives information regarding the presence of the ﬁve criteria for diagnosis or conﬁrmation of
TB 1n children. -

2. NTP Diagnosis Form for Children — This shall be accomplished for every TB
symptomatic child to determine if he has TB disease. It 13 completed by a physician who
I I dec1des if the child has TB Disease. and needs to be treated. Once completed, this rs attached

_ to the NTP Treatment Card for Childrent ‘

3. NTP Treatment Card for Children — This shall be opened for each TB patient
. admitted to treatment. It contains all pertinent information about the TB patient and records
the daily drug intake, results of monthly follow-up examination and outcome of- treatment.
This is kept at the health facility where the patient is receiving treatment but should be

 

_1 _. . returned to the main- health center after treannent- has been completed. This IS accomplished
by the physician nurse and midwife. ' .

-.4 TB Identiﬁcation (ID) Card for Children— This 1s a handy source of information
oh the patient’s diagnosis, kind of drugs, follow-up examination results and monitoring of -
drug intake. This is accomplished by the nurse and 1s given to the patient. The treatment
partner will. afﬁx his signature in the column. for the drug monitoring each time the patient is
' observed to take his drugs. .

5. ITB Register for Children- ._This 1s a listing of all TB cases Iunder treatment. This

gives information on the type and classiﬁcation, treatment regimen, result of follow-up I.

- - I smear examinations and outcome of treatment.- It 1s maintained by the nurse assigned at the
1 main health center. .- I

- The- following are the reports to be submitted quarterly to the Provincial/City health
' 'I Ofﬁces, center for Health Development and the Central Ofﬁce. All of these reports are
accomplished by the nurse. ' .
- - 1. Quarterly Report on Gaseﬁnding' of TB in Children— This summarizes the NTP '
. caseﬁnding 1n children for pulmonary. and extra-pulmonary cases. It shall be used by the
Regional / Central Coordinators to evaluate the easefinding of TB childhood cases.

_ 2. NTP Quarterly Retrospective Cohort Report for Children- This gives information

. on the outcome of treatment for a group of patients who were treated 12 15 months earlier. -

' Like 1n adults, it is the most important report in the TB control program since it will provide
' information on the effectiveness of Chemotherapy and to evaluate the Cure / Success Rate.

C. Drugs. and other NTP supplies.

The. health centers shall have adequate supply of anti-TB drugs for children and other NTP _. *
supplies to provide quality services. This includes tuberculin solution, tuberculin syringes, and
recording/reporting forms. Buffer stocks shall be maintained at all levels to avoid stock-outs.

The central Ofﬁce shall. procure anti-TB drugs for children and laboratory supplies to be
sent to the Centers for Health DeVeIOpmeInt who will 111 turn distribute to the provinces/cities. The -

provinces and cities will distribute the drugs and. supplies to the health centers. Quarterly request

1111111 be Ioarefully prepared by the lower level to avoid stock-oats and oversupply.
