<body>



I. Rationale 

With the "current administration’s thrust of pursuing the goal of achieving Kalusugan Pangkalahatan (KP), the DOH coordinates with various partners and stakeholders at various levels to mobilize the required resources and investments under the Sector Development Approach for Health (SDAH), as elaborated in AO 2007-0038 "Adopting the Sector Development Approach for Health (SD/1H) in the implementation of F1 for Health.” It aims to reduce fragmentation of partner support, increase the impact on health sector development and sustain institutional development by using government systems and procedures instead of parallel implementation structures. It is also incorporates the key principles of the Paris Declaration on Aid Effectiveness particularly on harmonization and alignment, which aims to reduce transaction costs in engagement with donors and other development partners particularly in the planning and review processes. 

In line with the Monitoring and Evaluation for Equity and Effectiveness (ME3) policy - (AO 2008—0016), the Department of Health (DOH) issued Administrative Order No. 2009-0018 dated October 15, 2009 on the “Adoption of the Development Partner Scorecard (DPS) under the Monitoring and Evaluation for Equity and Effectiveness (ME3). ” The DPS measures the inputs, structures, processes, and major ﬁnal outputs of development partner support. Under the said policy, the DPS monitor’s support by measuring the degree to which Development Partners (DPS) align to and support the current thrust and directions of the Department. However, there is a need to include additional indicators under the principles of respecting country ownership, managing for development results and mutual accountability. Thus, there is a need for the issuance of this policy.

Introduction 

The Development Partner Scorecard (DPS) is a tool to measure results, outputs and outcomes valuable to clients in a manner that can be easily comprehended. In this case the client is the Department of Health, the lead agency in the Philippine Health Sector. The DPS is intended to measure the progress by which Development Partners (DPS) abide by the Paris Declaration on Aid Effectiveness. The elements espoused in the Paris Declaration (ownership, alignment, harmonization, managing for results and mutual accountability) need the active cooperation and collaboration of all partners. 

The DPS shall be used as a self—assessment tool by the development partners for demonstrating progress in the Sector Development Approach for Health. It will serve as an instrument for dialogue between DOH and DPs and will not be used to compare or rank Development Partners. 

The main purpose of the scorecard is to move all partners towards greater aid effectiveness through the application of the principles of the Paris Declaration. The Declaration recognizes that aid effectiveness needs a dialogue and partnership between development partners and the government and a two-way commitment. 

Indicators 

There are 16 indicators in the scorecard, categorized under the ﬁve principles of the Paris Declaration on Aid effectiveness. Indicators were patterned after Indicators of Progress of the Paris Declaration and then modified to ﬁt the local situation. The indicators of this DPS shall measure the Donor’s 

contributions to the health sector and donors commitment to the sector development approach for health. 


- Ownership — Partner countries exercise effective leadership over their development policies, and strategies and coordinate development actions — 4 indicators 

- Alignment - Donors base their overall support on partner countries’ national development strategies, institutions and procedures — 4 indicators 

- Harmonization -— Donors’ actions are more harmonized, transparent and collectively effective - 4 indicators.

- Managing for Results —- Managing resources and improving decision making for results. Managing for results means managing and implementing aid in a way that focuses on the desired results and uses information to improve decision making. — 2 indicators 

- Mutual AcCountability — Donors and Partners are accountable for development results. A major priority for partner countries and. donors is to enhance mutual accountability and transparency in the use of development resources. This also helps strengthen public support for national policies and development assistance. — 2 indicators 

 
Color Coding Scheme 

The DPS will utilize a color coding scheme to present the status of an indicator. Only three colors will be used to keep the scheme simple and easy to understand. 

A red color code reﬂects that there is substantial potential for improvement. 


A yellow color code shows presence of some weakness in performance that should be addressed to optimize performance. 

A green color code reﬂects performance that is up to par or exceeds standards. 

Accomplishment of the Tool and Validation of Results 

Development Partners will be provided with an electronic copy of the DPS by the BIHC secretariat, and will accomplish the tool by coloring the circle across each indicator. Accomplished tools shall be submitted to the BIHC on a requested date. Results shall be validated and then consolidated for presentation in selected fora and publications.
