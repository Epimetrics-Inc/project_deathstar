<subject>SUBJECT: Guidelines in the implementation of Hospital-Based TB Control Program under the Hospitals as Centers of Wellness Program</subject>

<body>

A significant proportion of TB cases seek assistance from the hospitals. The first National TB Prevalence Study showed that 23% of TB symptomatic visit the hospitals. Based on the data gathered by the Hospital Operation and Management Services-DOH in 1997, TB ranks as the number two cause of deaths among DOH—retained hospitals, fifth as the reason for discharges and seventh as cause of consultations. Recognizing the important role of hospitals in the identification and management of TB cases, the TB Control Service (TBCS) coordinated with the Hospitals as Centers of Wellness Program (HCWP) and initiated the process of systematizing and strengthening the services being provided by the DOH-retained hospitals to TB symptomatic and TB patients.

This Order defines how the retained hospitals should participate in the implementation of National TB Control Program (NTP) which is one of the flagship programs of the Department of Health, under HCWP.

1.4 TB patient - a person diagnosed as one suffering from tuberculosis based on laboratory (sputum examination for AFB, radiological findings suggestive of tuberculosis) and/or histologic examination.
