<subject>SUBJECT: Amendment of Administrative Order No. 2006-0036 Schedule of fees for Certain Services Rendered by the Centers for Health Development in relation to Presidential Decree No. 856 Code on Sanitation of the Philippines;</subject>

<body>
Background / Rationale:

The Department of Education has identiﬁed about 5000 public school sites which are untitled and unregistered. Although covered by Deeds of Donation, the DepEd, in order to protect these schools from encroachment, illegal settling and adverse claims of private as well as public entities, entered into a MOA with the Dept. of Environment and Natural Resources on July 26, 2007 to facilitate the reservation of these public school sites for the same purpose thru issuance of special patents / presidential proclamations.

One of the requirements for the said issuance, based on Presidential Memorandum Circular No. 28 dated January 29, 1993, includes comments / recommendation and clearance from the Regional Health Director concerned and the Secretary of Health, respectively, in the case of public school sites.

In this regard, the DepEd, entered into a MOA with the DOH on February 24, 2011, copy hereto attached, with objectives as follows:

1. To facilitate the seeking of health clearance for their public school sites considering that these sites have been used exclusively for educational activities for a long period of time; and

2. To reduce the ﬁnancial burden of public schools, by providing the amount of P500.00 only per school site to the CHD concerned as a token of appreciation for issuing a certification of the suitability of the site per DOH Criteria.

Therefore, Administrative Order No. 2006-0036 is hereby amended to reduce the prescribed fee for the issuance of certiﬁcation on site suitability, for public schools from P2,800.00 to P500.00 only.

All other provisions of AO No. 2006-0036 still remain in effect.
