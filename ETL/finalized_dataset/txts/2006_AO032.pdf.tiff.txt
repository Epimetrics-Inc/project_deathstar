<subject>SUBJECT: Revised Guidelines on the Payment of Longevity Pay to Deserving Public Health Worker</subject>


<body>

I. RATIONALE

In order to set the policy which shall serve as basis in granting longevity pay to Public Health Workers (PHWS) who have continuously rendered efﬁcient meritorious service, the guidelines in granting longevity pay to deserving PHWs are hereby prescribed:

II. COVERAGE

All Public Health Workers regardless of the nature of appointments, who have rendered ﬁve (5) years of continuous, efﬁcient, meritorious services as Certiﬁed by the Head of Agency/Local Chief Executive shall be entitled to monthly longevity pay equivalent to ﬁve percent (5%) of the present monthly basic pay starting APRIL 17, 1992 and for every succeeding 5—year service thereafter.

III. CRITERIA

The PHW shall meet the following requirements for entitlement to Longevity Pay based on the attached computation:

1) Must have served for ﬁve (5) years as PHW. Continuous service includes employment on a permanent, temporary, casual and contractual except job contract.

2) Must have not been found guilty of any administrative or criminal case within the ﬁve—year period.

3) Must have at least satisfactory performance rating during the ﬁve-year period.

IV. RULES AND REGULATIONS

1) Any PHW who has rendered ﬁve (5) years of service at any time from April 17, 1992 and has complied with the requirements is entitled to longevity pay computed from the salary at the time the 5-year is completed.

2) PHW who have performance rating of below Satisfactory, or have been found guilty of any administrative or criminal case or have authorized leave without pay for more than 15 calendar days shall be disqualiﬁed to receive longevity pay only for the period covering such disqualiﬁcations.

3) For purposes of computing the length of service for the grant of longevity pay, approved vacation leave without pay for an aggregate of 15 working days shall not interrupt the continuity of the ﬁve-year service requirement for the grant of longevity pay. However, if the total number of authorized vacation leave without pay incurred within the ﬁve-year period exceeds 15 working days, the grant of longevity pay will only be delayed for the same number of days that a PHW was absent without pay.

4) The longevity pay shall be incorporated in the salary of PHW three (3) months prior to compulsory retirement. This shall become the basis in the computation of retirement beneﬁts.

V. EXEMPTIONS

Consultants and/or experts who are hired for speciﬁc purposes and services are not covered by this Order.

VI. FUNDING SOURCE

Funds for this purpose shall be charged against any available savings of authorized appropriations of the respective Ofﬁces, subject to pertinent budgeting, accounting and auditing rules and regulations.

This Order shall take effect December 1, 2006. All other issuances inconsistent herewith are hereby repealed/rescinded.
