<subject>SUBJECT: Guidelines to Strengthen Sentrong Sigla Certification</subject>

<body>
I. Background

Since its Phase I implementation in mid-1999, Sentrong Sigla Certification (SSC) has successfully stimulated strong interest and active participation of local government units in raising the quality of health care in their public health facilities. Local Chief Executives (LCEs) like Mayors and Governors have shown their support by appropriating funds to equip their health facilities and train their health staff to meet Sentrong Sigla (SS) standards.

To date, 48% of Health Centers, 14% of District and Provincial Hospitals, and 3% of Barangay Health Stations (BHS) have been certified using the SS Phase I Level 1 standards for "readiness to provide services" or mostly input indicators.

After three and a half years of experience with this innovative approach, many valuable lessons have been learned that will maximize the potential of SSC. Recognition of good quality health services will ensure that DOH maintains leadership in health and thus create health impact through more effective and better quality public health programs and services.

The following are the major lessons learned from SS Certification Phase I:

1. That while input-only standards for Phase 1 Level 1 are easy to measure, there is a strong need to put upfront the standards that combine simple input, process and output indicators to promote basic total systems development. The use of input-only standards in Phase I Level 1 conflicted with the total quality concept of the SS seal being conferred on certified Level 1 facilities. Input only standards seemed too low for existing health services. The original multi-tiered plan of replacing the Level 1 input standards in Level 2 , and then again replacing the process standards with outcome standards in Level 3 could not achieve the total quality objectives. Besides, LGUs prefer to be measured upfront on fairly stable, total systems quality standards.

2. That appropriate incentives should be carefully selected. While it is important that incentives be attractive, these should also be appropriate, sensible and sustainable. During SS Phase I, there was too much focus on monetary rewards. This succeeded in generating overwhelming interest in SS but it distracted the LGUs and the DOH staff from the quality objectives of SS. The quest for the million peso prize led them to skip the capability-building steps which were most crucial to the change process.

3. That there is a need to ensure that adequate time is allotted to the crucial change processes, such as internalization of the quality standards by the local Chief Executive and his local health staff, the provision of support and technical assistance by DOH and other quality improvement activities prior to formal assessment.

4. That there is a need to provide upfront multi-tiered, progressively improving quality standards to drive continuing quality improvement.

Thus, with these lessons in mind, there is need to revise the quality standards, procedures and incentives scheme to maximize the potentials of SS certification as a tool for quality improvement.

II. Purpose

These guidelines are being issued to guide the transition steps in order to ensure the smooth change from SS Phase I to a strengthened SS Phase II.

III. Overall Directional Changes and Evolution of Concepts

From a Quality Assurance Program in 1998 and the Sentrong Sigla Movement in 1999 that both focused on the DOH-LGU partnership, the effort to raise the quality of health care has now expanded to involve the entire health sector in the new Philippine Quality in Health Program (QIH Program). Approved in 2002, the QIH Program strategies now include other instruments and interventions that can raise quality of health services, such as mandatory licensing and accreditation and reimbursement schemes of the Philippine Health Insurance Corporation (PHIC). Efforts of professional societies and other groups were also acknowledged. Administrative Order 17-B s. 2003 outlines the five-year strategic plan to achieve Philippine Quality in Health Program.

In the QIH framework, the certification strategy of the "SS Movement" - specifically, Sentrong Sigla "Certification" - is retained as an important strategy among the various accreditation approaches in the QlH Program.

IV. Revisions in the Overall Certification Process

In order to maintain the focus of SS on its quality objectives, guiding principles were more clearly laid out in the Sentrong Sigla Strategic Plan for Phase II, 2003-2007. The definition of terms, goals, objectives, new standards, procedures, incentives and other changes as defined in this strategic document are hereby adopted as an integral part of these guidelines.

Under SSC Phase II, the national and regional DOH staff shall actively disseminate the revised SS Certification standards, procedures and incentives to emphasize the following basic messages:

1. That SS Certification is still multi-tiered with Levels 1, 2 and 3.

2. That the Phase II SS standards for Level 1 Basic SS Certification represent total systems quality standards that are still very simple and can be easily attained; that these are only more complete and better reflect total quality health services compared to the previous Level 1 standards;

3. That the new standards, also embodied in the Quality Standards List (QSL) put priority on the integrated public health services in order to achieve and sustain disease prevention and control objectives. Effective prevention is the only way to reduce work burden on health workers, and eventually free resources for further quality care and better systems;

4. That while million-peso rewards will no longer be available to the few "national" winners, matching grants will be made available to all those who succeed in achieving the standards. In effect, while the amount is reduced, the reward will benefit more health facilities.

5. That individuals in an SS certified facility will also be recognized so that they can retain their record of performance even if they are transferred to other health facilities.

Figure l: The SS Certification Process Flowchart illustrates the overall SS certification process. In the flowchart, the DOH - LGU partnership is closer through the DOH Representative who joins the LGU group as early as the self-assessment step. The LGU plan that comes out of the self-assessment should illustrate the matching of resources from the local counterpart and the DOH-CHI). The formality of the LGU having to request for technical assistance is no longer necessary because the DOH Rep should be able to communicate the LGU technical assistance (TA) needs directly to the CHD.

IV-A. Technical Assistance

In SS Phase II, the technical assistance stage is now recognized as the most crucial stage during which quality transformation occurs within the LGU facility. The LGU staff has to internalize the quality standards, build strong internal commitment and execute the necessary changes during this period. As in any growth process, the LGU is expected to put up its counterpart in improving its own systems, especially in terms of logistics and infrastructure changes that are needed. The DOH, on the other hand, shall provide technical assistance and through the DOH Representatives (DOH Reps) and other CHD technical staff, serves as the helpful but firm "coach" throughout this process. When necessary, DOH can facilitate assistance by other donors and Sponsors through donors meetings and solicitations for specific needs such as the Adopt a Health Center Project, Lakbay Aral sa Kalusugan and others.

In SS Phase I, becoming SS certified is completely voluntary. In SS Phase II, the CHDs shall deveIOp their own criteria to identify health centers in key areas, like island municipalities, far flung mountainous municipalities or congested city/urban slums that have to be SS certified. Additional support and attention shall be given to encourage these LGU facilities to become SS certified.

Thus, regional budgets should provide funds for adequate preparation of well-designed technical assistance. Existing guidelines and activities targeted at the LGU, such as Executive Order 205 regarding planning, and the Local Government Code regarding guidelines for LGU health budgeting and administrative actions, among others, shall be reviewed and aligned with the revised SS priorities and standards.

The CHDs shall prepare TA packages that will be needed by the LGU to meet SS standards based on national TA packages/guidelines (refer to Sentrong Sigla Technical Assistance Package, May 2003). These packages shall promote the attainment of the SS quality standards for all levels of quality. Reassignment, orientation, training and other capability-building activities of DOH Reps shall be provided by the CHD as needed according to the enhanced role of the DOH Reps in SS.

IV-B. Assessment

1. Assessment Process

Assessment of health facilities can be done anytime during the year. This may be initiated by the receipt of a letter from the LGU's local chief executive signifying the health facility's readiness for assessment, after technical assistance had been provided to the health facility. The assessment is then conducted by the CHD Assessment Teams. The CHD Assessment team will conduct an exit conference with the health facility staff and the LCE.

The CHD shall formally communicate to the LGU, the result of the assessment visit by the assessment team. The communication shall contain the following information: the score that the health facility achieved and whether the health facility has passed or failed the assessment.

When an LGU health facility fails the assessment, it will be assisted by the CHD TA team in coming up with a new quality improvement plan to correct their deficiencies.

2. Assessors Organization, Training and Supervision

The assessors shall be recruited from regional and national DOH staff, preferably from the Licensing and Regulation Enforcement units, and other partners in the health sector such as the active representatives from the Department of Interior and Local Government (DILG), Department of Social Welfare and Development (DSWD), NGOs, the academe and others. There shall be systematic training and certification of assessors. Re-training and skills upgrade of assessors should be done as necessary by the Bureau of Local Health and Development (BLHD) in cooperation with the CHDs, especially whenever quality standards or procedures are modified. Future assessors training that will be funded by BLHD may be contracted out. Hence, BLHD may charge a training fee for each CHD participant from CHD SSCC funds for training.

Special arrangements for assessment shall be made to the Autonomous Region of Muslim Mindanao (ARMM). The Special Assessment Teams for ARMM shall be organized by the BLHD. Members shall come from national DOH units, DOH staff from regions other than ARMM, and other partners at national and regional levels including other GOs and NGOs based in ARMM.

Assessors shall be certified and supervised according to the following procedures:

1. Potential assessors shall undergo a basic assessors' training that includes didactics and practice field assessment. After training, the BLHD confers certification.

2. An Assessment Team Supervisor shall be assigned for every two (2) or three (3) assessment teams;; the supervisor shall recommend annual renewal of certification of the assessors under his/ her supervision based on their performance monitoring.

3. The supervisor shall also collect regular feedback from LGUs that were assessed by his/her assessors and investigate any negative feedback.

4. The Bureau of Local Health Development shall renew the certificates for assessors who have been favorably endorsed by their Regional SSCC based on results of monitoring by their supervisors. This will be done for the first three (3) years.

Assessment and conferment of certification by Level is as follows:

1. For Level 1 Basic Certification, CHD Assessors shall conduct the assessment and recommend SS certification, which shall be awarded by the CHD Director.

2. For Level 2 Specialty Certification, CHD Assessors may include additional assessors from relevant national units. The CHD Director shall award Level 2 certificates upon favorable recommendation by the assessors.

3. For Level 3 Excellence Certification, DOH National Assessors shall conduct the assessment and recommend SS certification, which in turn shall be awarded by the Secretary of Health.

3. Validity of Certification

The constant aim is to motivate the LGU to attain progressively higher quality standards. However, should the LGU not apply for higher level certification, its certificate for the current level should be re-assessed by the CHD Assessors every two (2) years. Appropriate two-year validity stickers shall be affixed onto the seal by the Assessors.

Facilities that have already been certified by the end of December 2003 for Level 1 Basic SS Certification using the Phase I quality standards shall be regarded as qualified to apply for Level 2 Specialty Certification and shall be issued validity stickers indicating at least two (2) years from the time they were originally certified or end of 2003 at the least. However, when they are assessed for Level 2 certification, these facilities shall also be assessed thoroughly using the Phase II new Level 1 Basic certification standards in addition to the Level 2 standards.

V. Incentives

The revised incentives scheme outlined in the Sentrong Sigla Strategic Plan for 2003-2007, shall be used for Year 2003-2007. As emphasized in the statement of guiding principles, recognition symbolized by the SS seal shall be the main incentive to improve quality. Other allowable incentives for attaining SS standards shall be the eligibility for appropriate grants, which shall be used by the LGU to attain the next higher certification level, individual certificates of recognition and study grants for the next level of certification. Only equipment or materials that are listed in the logistics section of the SS quality standards for Level 1 and succeeding levels, as appropriate to the LGU SS status, may be granted by the CHDs if their budgets allow them to provide additional support.

Other monetary or material incentives that are not specified in the logistics section of the SS standards (such as karaoke system) may not be given by the CHDs as additional incentives to avoid over emphasis on monetary or material rewards.

The appropriate range of amount for grants for each SS level, the Specific guidelines for Memoranda of Agreements (MOAs) and the procedures for eligibility, release and liquidation shall be covered by a separate Department issuance on Financial Arrangements for Grant Projects based on projected budgetary requirements for SS, review of the existing arrangements and the lessons learned from the current grant programs.

Aside from the retention of the seal or banner and the updating of the validity year on the seal or banner, there shall be no other material incentives for renewals of existing certification levels. Grant for technical assistance may be considered for exceptional cases, and this shall likewise be guided in greater detail by the appropriate Department issuance on Financial Arrangements for Grant Projects.

VI. Organization

A. Management

The former National SS Steering Committee shall henceforth be called the National Sentrong Sigla Certification Committee or the National SSCC. It shall retain its functions and Sub-committees as defined in Department Order No. 194 s. 2001.

For Phase II, multi-sector Regional SS Certification Committees (SSCC) shall be established under the Office of the Regional Health Director, chaired by the Assistant Regional Health Director. Its members shall include the Chiefs of the Local Health Assistance Division, the Licensing and Regulatory Enforcement Division and of the Health Operations Division. Other members shall come from partner agencies, with some representatives from selected LGUs (province, city and municipal levels). The Regional SSCC shall oversee the SS activities in the Region. The Regional SSCC shall also analyze and evaluate the performance of the Technical Assistance and Assessment Teams. The designated Regional SS point person shall head the secretariat that shall support the Regional SSCC.

B. Technical Assistance Team

National and Regional SS Technical Assistance (SSTA) Teams shall also be organized. The National SSTA Team shall be headed by the Director of the Bureau of Local Health and Development (BLHD); its members shall come from the various technical units of the DOH and other partners in the health sector.

The Regional SSTA Team shall headed be the Chief of the Local Health Assistance Division. The Chief of the Division of Local Health Assistance (LHAD) shall head the Regional SS TA Team. The members shall include all DOH Representatives and technical staff from the Division of Health Operations. Where possible, resource persons shall also be invited from partner agencies, especially the academe and NGOs active in health programs of the DOH. The staff of the Health Operations Division shall provide additional technical support as necessary.

The DOH Representative to the municipality/city shall be the primary technical assistant to his her assigned municipality/city.

C. Assessment Team

National and Regional SS Assessment (SSA) Teams shall also be organized. The National SSA Team shall be headed by the Director of the National Center for Disease Prevention and Control (NCDPC). Its members shall include the head and staff of the Bureau of Licensing, of other DOH units like the NCDPC and the Bureau of Local Health Development (BLHD) and other DOH partner agencies that have been trained and certified assessors.

The Regional SSA Team shall be headed by the Chief of the Division of Licensing, Regulation Enforcement. The members of the Regional SSA Teams shall be trained and certified SS Assessors from the regional DOH staff and from partner agencies. A team of three (3) Assessors shall be fielded to assess each health facility. An Assessment Team Supervisor shall be trained to supervise about two to three (2-3) Assessor Field Teams or as many field teams as deemed necessary in each region. The Assessment Team Supervisors shall ensure proper training/re-training and certification/re-certification of his/ her field team members. The Regional Assessment Teams shall be concerned with the certification of health facilities.

VII. Budget

Below are the general guidelines for budgeting for SS activities and incentives. As stated above, a separate issuance shall be released to define more specific details of the financial arrangements including the range of amount for grants.

DOH budget shall be provided for SS activities from the general appropriations at the national and regional levels. In the CHD, this shall be from several sources especially the budget of the Local Health Assistance Division (LHAD). Table 1 shall be the guide to budgetary planning for SS at the national and regional levels.

The CHDs shall plan their budget to assume that at least 10-15% of their LGUs will become certified for Level 1 annually, and at least 5% will become certified Level 2 annually. Regional estimates may be modified based on actual LGU performance. Budget for Level 3 facilities can be predicted based on specific LGU performance.

Funds for logistics, infrastructure and major equipment are preferably LGU counterparts .

<image>table_1.png</image>

Funds for technical packages to assist LGUs become SS Level 1 especially when local resources are limited may also be provided by the CHDs. Technical packages may include sponsorship to technical or managerial courses, visit or exposure to model health facilities, information materials, additional equipment, supplies and other materials.

While the DOH does not guarantee non-technical assistance, such as infrastructure or items for capital outlay, DOH at all levels may facilitate donations by private groups or agencies for needy health facilities through the Adopt a Health Center Project.

In 2003, BLHD has some funds to assist infrastructure improvements in HSRA "convergence" municipalities. These have already been allocated to selected needy municipalities and the funds sub-allotted to their respective regions. MOAs are to be prepared to facilitate the release and liquidation of these funds.

The existing guidelines for the use of the funds for the Grant Program already include SS among the priority activities. MGP budgets shall not be released in 2003 to Regions whose unutilized MGP funds exceed 2 million pesos. The effort to raise utilization and liquidation of MGP funds should be improved.

MOAs should also cover the grants that will be given as incentive to LGUs that have attained SS standards. As stated above in the section on incentives, other detailed guidelines shall be covered by a separate DOH issuance.

VIII. Monitoring and Evaluation

Pursuant to the SS standards, the Field Health Services Information System shall continue to be the main source of health and management information within the public health system. Efforts to align the FHSIS with ICD10 and to install ICD10 nationwide shall be part of SS TA packages.

The BLHD shall oversee the overall monitoring and evaluation of SS. The Management Information Service (MIS) and National Epidemiology Center (NBC) shall assist BLHD in installing and maintaining the SS monitoring and evaluation system.

A manual on Sentrong Sigla which will include the SS Strategic Plan, the SS Quality Standards List, the SS Technical Assistance Package, other SS tools . shall be disseminated to serve as ready reference in the implementation of this Order.

IX. Repealing Clause

All Department issuances and orders previously issued related with this Order be duly repealed /rescinded.

X. Effectivity

This Order takes effect immediately.
