<subject>SUBJECT: Implementing Rules and Regulations for the Integration of Training Programs of the Department of Health as Stipulated in Section 4 of A.O. 9-A s. 1996 dated April 15, 1996</subject>

<body>

SECTION I: RATIONALE

Based on consultations and focused group discussions with program managers and regional staff, a review of training programs conducted in the DOH revealed the following:

* planning, designing and implementing training programs is program-based resulting to numerous training programs in a year and overlaps in terms of time, content and participants compromising time for service delivery in the LGUs.

* a persistent top-down approach to training depriving the Regions and ultimately the provinces from responding to their own identified training needs which may be unique in different Region/Province and among the different health workers;

* objectives of training programs are sometimes not met due to substitution of participants again resulting from overlapping schedules of training, directed at the same categories of health workers; and 

* inefficient utilization of training resources resulting from the above mentioned situations.

Devolution of health services has emphasized the need for an integrated package of training. Human resource development, which includes the training of health workers in the ﬁeld, is now the responsibility of the local government executives (LGEs). Therefore, training programs offered by the Department of Health for health workers based at the provincial and municipal offices and the provincial and district hospitals have first to be advocated to the LGU officials. To be able to accomplish this task, training have to be relevant to the LGUs needs and focused on actual competencies needed by the health workers in their work place. Furthermore, it should be planned in such a way as to minimize the absence of health workers from their localities so as not to compromise the time spent for actual service delivery. 

In this regard, the DOH has seen the need to integrate training programs being offered by the Department especially for ﬁeld personnel who are the beneficiaries of the numerous training programs being conducted.


SECTION II: SCOPE

This Implementing Rules and Regulations (IRR) shall cover training programs being organized and offered by the DOH for all health workers whether devolved, organic or retained who are expected to deliver quality basic services in a wholistic approach.

 
SECTION III: DEFINITION OF TERMS

Standard/core competencies - the minimum set of knowledge, attitude and skills required to perform the activities within an occupation or function to the standard expected in employment

Basic Training Course — training course that addresses the entire range of standard/core competencies identified for a job.

Specialized Training Course - training course addressing competencies not included in the core competencies. These are competencies identified to respond to special unique  conditions or functions of a health worker which, for one reason or another, cannot be included in the integrated training design. Example would be Basic Acupuncture Course offered to selected MHOs for Hospital Physicians who are traditional medicine practitioners. 

Refresher Training Course - training course that addresses gaps identified after comparing actual against standard competencies identified in a job and/or new expectations in job resulting from changes in the (1)program and policies, patient care management or treatment protocol, agency’s role definition, (4) new programs developed; and (5) agency’s philosophy or structure.

 
SECTION IV: GENERAL GUIDELINES

1. Training programs shall be integrated by categories of health workers

2. HMDITS shall conduct a competencv analysis per category of health workers; in consultation with various Services/Programs/Units of the Department, the academe and selected stakeholders. Competencies shall be classified into basic (core) and specialized. The integrated training program by health worker category shall be developed utilizing identified basic or core competencies.

3. The integrated basic training program may be used as the orientation course for the new entrants per category of health workers. Training modules shall be formulated in consultation and/or coordination with Services/Programs/Units involved. The conceptual framework for integrated training approach is attached as Annex A.

4. Training modules for the negated training course shall be organized by cluster of services being offered. Annex B suggest a way of clustering services. Final clustering will be determined in a consultative workshop with all program managers. 

5. HMDTD shall conduct TNA of health workers and compare the results against the standard core competencies. These shall form the basis for region—specific integrated basic training course. The technical division shall participate in the final preparation of the training design.

6. Refresher course shall be developed when need arises as described in the Definition of Terms. Program Managers at the Central Office level shall inform HMDTS of any necessary changes in competencies required for a particular health worker category. If the change is limited to an area, the Program Coordinators in the Region shall inform the HMDTD so that dialogue with and among units concerned could be initiated and refresher course be developed.

7. Basic Training Courses shall be reviewed and updated every five (5) years, or as necessary. Changes introduced in the Refresher Course may become part of the updated basic training course.

8. Aside from the usual classroom type of training, innovative methods of training such as distance learning education, on the job training utilizing supervisors, field observations and the like, shall be considered as methods to be used in the integrated approach to training. Duration of the integrated basic and refresher training courses shall be based on the minimum required competencies identified for a course.

9. Implementation of the integrate basic and refresher course shall be managed by the HMDTS fat the Central Office and the HMDTD at the Regions.

10. A roster of resource persons or subject matter experts (SME) shall be developed in consultation with the Program Managers in the Central Office and the Technical Division of the Regional Offices. The list shall include persons from DOH (Central and Regional Offices), other government agencies, NGOs, LGUs and other appropriate agencies. These SME shall be tapped in the conduct of the integrated training programs.

11. Specialized training courses to respond to identified competencies for specialized or unique functions of health workers shall be developed.

12. Specialized training courses shall be designed and implemented by specific Service/Programs/Units in close coordination with HMDTS at the Central Office and HMDTD at the Regions. 

13. Schedules, of integrated and all other training shall be incorporated into a Regional Training calendar to be developed by the HMDTD in each Region. Training calendars, as provided for in A.O. 9-A, shall be submitted to HMDTS at the Central Office for consolidation into the DOH Annual Training Calendar. 

14. The DOH Annual Calendar shall be circulated to the Program Managers at the Central Office. Regional Training Calendar, on the other hand, shall be circulated to the LGUs at the start of each calendar year as the courses being offered by the DOH, for all health workers to provide the LGUs a roster of training programs they may attend.

15. HMDTS, in close coordination with MAS, shall maintain and update TNA and competencies files of all organic and devolved health workers at the regional level.


SECTION V: MONITORING AND EVALUATION

1. Monitoring of the integrated basic and refresher training programs shall be through the Integrated Monitoring System (EMS) of the Internal Planning Service (IPS).

4. If, after assessment of the project, integration into existing curricula is not possible for whatever valid reasons as determined by HMDTS and approved by the  EXECOM, then clearance shall be given by HMDTS prior to final implementation that such a program does not overlap in terms of schedule, content, and participants with other resisting training programs.
