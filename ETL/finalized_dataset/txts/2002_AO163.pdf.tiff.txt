<subject>SUBJECT: Implementing Guidelines and Procedures in the Procurement and Requisition of Drugs and Medicines by the Department of Health Pursuant to Executive Order No. 49 dated January 21, 1993.</subject>

<body>
I. Rationale

In compliance with the R.A. No. 6675, otherwise known as the Generics Act of 1988, entitled "An Act to Promote, Require and Ensure the Production of an Adequate Supply, Distribution, Use and Acceptance of Drugs and Medicines identified by their Generic Names" Section 4 (a), the Department of Health (DOH) organized the National Drug Committee (NDC), tasked to formulate the Essential Drugs List known as the Philippine National Drug Formulary (PNDF) Volume I. In the year 2001, the NDC was renamed as the National Formulary Committee (NFC).

The PNDF is a basic component of the National Drug Policy which seeks to bring about the availability of safe, efficacious, and quality drugs at affordable cost. The PNDF is an important step to rationalize drug production, distribution, procurement and consumption through the Essential Drugs concept.

In 1923, Executive Order No. 49 was issued entitled "Directing the Mandatory use of the Philippine National Drug Formulary (PNDF) Volume I as the Basis for Procurement of Drug Products by the Government."

Implementation was immediately enforced with the use of the PNDF Volume I current edition as the basis for procurement of Drug Products by the government. The PNDF became the basis for claim reimbursements for drugs and medicines through a Philippine Health Insurance Corporation (PHIC) Board Resolution #265 s.1999 dated July 15, 1999.

II. In implementing these guidelines the following Policies and Procedures shall be adopted:

1. Only drug products that fall within and conform with the Essential Drugs List, the Philippine National Formulary (PNDF) Volume I, current edition, shall be allowed to be requisitioned and procured by all Government Agencies including government-owned and controlled corporations.

2. Every Requisition and Issue Voucher (RIV) or any request for procurement including Emergency Purchase of drugs and medicines authorized under the General Appropriation Act, shall be accompanied by a certification signed by the requisitioning officer that the drug products being requisitioned or procured fall within and conform with PNDF Vol. 1, current edition.

3. Auditors/heads of auditing units shall monitor compliance thereto and shall disallow claims/disbursements either from regular budget, local/trust funds, covering the procurement of drugs and medicines which are not within the PNDF Volume I, current edition.

4. Drugs and medicines not listed in the PNDF Volume 1, current edition may be procured by Government agencies through a written request with corresponding justification addressed to the Head of the National Drug Policy Staff who may approve or disapprove the request. However, in determining whether the drug(s) requested is/are justified or not, the said Head shall refer the request to the National Formulary Committee (NFC).

4.1 A letter shall be submitted justifying that:

4.1.1 The drug is needed for the prevention and treatment of conditions not already covered in the existing list.

4.1.2 The drug is more effective and/or less toxic than a drug listed for the same indication.

4.1.3 The drug is at least as effective and safe and of lower cost than the drug listed for the same indication.

4.1.4 The drug is deemed essential for a specific DOH—Health program/project.

4.2  The said justification letter shall have the following as attached documents:

4.2.1 Scientific evidence (in table format) supported with literature review for the specific drug (Appendix A & B).

4.2.2 Report on the disease burden and its ranking relative to the common diseases seen in the hospital.

4.2.3 Comparison of costs for the total regimen of the drug or its full course of therapy with other comparable drugs listed in the current edition of the PNDF Vol. I.

4.2.4 Copy of Certificate of Product Registration.

5. The National Formulary Committee is hereby authorized to issue such other guidelines as may be necessary to implement this Administrative Order.

III. Repealing Clause

All previous Orders inconsistent in part or in whole to this Administrative Order are hereby rescinded or amended accordingly.

IV. Effectivity

This Order takes effect immediately.

ANNOTATIONS

A Some drugs of proven efficacy and safety are not available in the market for lack of profitability or perceived demand but are considered essential, hence included in the PNDF marked with asterisk.

B Systematic literature reviews in which studies are systematically searched, assembled, appraised and summarized using explicit and reproducible approaches that minimizes biases and random errors (after Sacks, Chalmers, Smith. Randomized versus historical controls for clinical trials. Am J Med 1982; 72:233-40.). The steps that the National Formulary Committee take in conducting systematic literature reviews on specific drugs are the following:

1. We pose the question: Is drug X a safe and efficacious drug for condition Y?
2. We conduct a comprehensive search for randomized controlled trials in HERDIN, MEDLINE, EMBASE, the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register in the Cochrane Library. We combine the generic name of the drug and the MESH terms of the indications for its use with the optimum set of keywords and commands for locating RCTs as given in the Cochrane Handbook for Preparing Systematic Reviews. We search for systematic reviews in the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews using the generic name of the drug as keyword.
3. We evaluate the abstracts of the studies to verify whether they are really RCTs or not and their relevance to our question.
4. We extract data on safety and efficacy from the study abstracts or, if needed, from the full texts.
5. We summarize the results of each study in an evidence table and examine similarities and differences of finding across studies. If appropriate, meta-analyses are performed to quantitatively combine the results of several studies.

C Benefits are expressed in risk differences and / or numbers needed to treat (NNT). We define risk as the proportion of people who develop a bad event among all of those who are at risk for developing it. The efficacy of drug X is reflected by the size of the difference in the risk of developing a bad event with and without drug X. (the absolute risk difference or ARR). Alternatively, the number of people who need to be treated with drug X to prevent one bad event (the NNT) may be obtained by the formula NNT = 1/ARR such that the smaller the NNT the more efficacious the drug. Safety is inversely proportional to the risk for adverse effects and is similarly expressed in risk differences and / or numbers needed to harm (NNH). Thus, as the risk difference rises or the NNH decreases the drug is deemed less and less safe.

D1 Recently completed RCTs or systematic reviews that show new drugs to be more efficacious or safe (see C for definitions of efficacy and safety) than other drugs in the same class may be grounds for their inclusion in lieu of or as a complement to formulary drugs. However, the NFC may choose to perform a cost-effectiveness analysis when newer, more efficacious drugs are more expensive: than formulary drugs.

D2 The bases for deletion include the following: (1) recently completed RCTs of systematic reviews that show formulary drugs to be less efficacious or safe (see C for definitions of efficacy and safety) than other drugs in the same class; (2) cost-effectiveness analysis favors newer drugs of the same therapeutic class as the formulary drugs.
