<body>
Republic of the Philippines Department of Health OFFICE OF THE SECRETARY 

I. RATIONALE: 

Traditional methods of recording and reporting health information, paper-based reporting of program accomplishments and indicators are carried out especially in remote areas. Patient information are kept at health facilities and summary of reports at different levels of aggregation are manually prepared. This makes detailed analysis difficult and time-consuming. 

The Philippine Malaria Information System (PhilMIS) was developed through the National Epidemiology Center (NEC) by modifying the Rural Health Unit Information System (RHUMIS) of the successful Agusan del Sur Malaria Control Project (ADS- MCP). The PhilMIS was developed to assist the Department of Health to achieve the following: a) competently informed planning, implementation, monitoring and evaluation of the Malaria program through the production of computerized data, b) standardized collection of malaria data using the same reporting and recording forms, c) generation of quality data, (1) easy retrieval of malaria indicators and e) prompt reporting system that addresses delays in generating required local malaria information 

The DOH, with support from the WHO, developed the PhilMIS Standard Operating Guidelines (SOG) to facilitate PhilMIS use These guidelines shall serve as a benchmark for multi-level implementation of PhilMIS processes that range from data recording to useful analysis of information and its eventual use. 

II. OBJECTIVE: 

This Order shall set the guidelines in the implementation of the modified PhilMIS in all malaria endemic provinces and chartered cities. 

HI. SCOPE AND COVERAGE: 

These guidelines shall apply to all health workers in the national, regional, provincial and city health offices whose functions and activities contribute to the use of the Modified PhilMIS in recording and reporting malaria cases, deaths and veCtor control activities. 

 

IV. DEFINITION OF TERMS: 

A. Active case detection is an operation carried out by health workers who visit every locality in a deﬁned area at regular intervals (usually monthly during the transmission season), in order to enquire for fever cases through individual house visits, and to test for malaria (and treat if positive) each suspected person so discovered. 

B. Barangay Malaria Microscopy Center (BMMC) is a health facility (usually 3 Barangay Health Station) where malaria microscopy diagnosis and treatment services are made available by a trained malaria microscopist. 

C. Confirmed malaria death is a death of a patient due to malaria, with laboratory conformation or diagnosis. 

D. Conﬁrmed severe malaria is a case with fever/history of fever with any of the following signs and symptoms: chills, sweating, headache, enlarge spleen and manifests any of the following: extreme weakness or inability to sit] stand, hyperthermia, severe pallor/jaundice/ yellowish discoloration of eyes! skin delirium, coma, reddish! coffee colored urine, weak pulse, difficulty of breathing and conﬁrmed positive for malaria. 

E. Continued uncomplicated malaria is a case with fever/history of fever and manifests any of the following signs and symptoms: chills, sweating, headache, enlarge spleen and conﬁrmed positive for malaria. 

F. Epidemic-risk areas are low-endemic areas where factors which may cause the occurrence of epidemic are present such as inﬂux of laborers in developmental projects, local or foreign tourists, movement of indigenous people, military personnel and displaced populations from malaria endemic provinces or countries and or in areas bordering endemic areas. 

G. Indoor residual spraying is a method of applying insecticide with a hand- compression spray can on the inner walls and ceilings or the underside of the roof and. caves of all houses in a given area, in order to kill adult mosquito vectors that land and rest on these treated walls. 

H. Malaria Registry is a health facility record book used by health workers to list details of the diagnosis and treatment of procedures undertaken per malaria patient. 

1. Mass blood survey: is an examination of blood film for malaria parasites from every person in a community, group of communities or in a speciﬁc population of an area to identify the individual cases of parasites or carriers of parasites who are not sick. 

J. Philippine Malaria Information System is an information system developed by the Department of Health through the National Epidemiology Center. The system aims to provide information in a computerized form in order to aid the planning, implementation, monitoring and evaluation of the National Malaria Control 


K. PhilMIS point person is a designated staff in every health facility/office assigned to undertake PhilMIS—related tasks. 

L. Mosquito net treatment is a vector control strategy of dipping mosquito nets into an insecticide solution that remains effective for a period of time. 

M. Mosquito net re-treatment is a routinely treating old/existing conventional mosquito nets owned by households with an insecticide Solution. 

N. Rapid diagnostic test is an antigen—based stick, cassette or card test for malaria in which a colored line indicates that plasmodial antigens have been detected. 

O. Vector Control is a strategy applied in malaria control that aiIns to reduce malaria morbidity and mortality by reducing the levels of transmission. Refers to insecticide treated and indoor residual spraying. 

V. GENERAL GUIDELINES: 

A. The modified PhilMIS shall be used in all malaria endemic provinces. 

B. The PhilMIS software was created using MS Visual Foxpro Version 9, a popular development tool for creating data base applications, running on a license-free software that can use any Windows operating system that makes PhilMIS easy to- distribute and utilize at the local level. 

C. The modiﬁed PhilMIS guidelines shall be implemented in all provinces in CHD— CAR; Pangasinan in CI-ID—I; all provinces in CHD-II except Bunnies; all provinces in ‘CHD-III except Pampanga; Quezon and Rizal provinces in CHD—IV- A; Palawan , Occidental Mindoro and Oriental Mindoro in CHD-IV-B; Zamboanga del Norte, Sur and Sibugay in CHD~IX; Bukidnon and Misamis Oriental in CHD-X; all provinces in CI-ID-XI; all provinces in CI-ID—XII; all provinces of Caraga region except Surigao del Norte and Dinagat Islands; and Basilan, Sulu, Tawi-Tawi in CHD-ARMM. 

D. The modified PhilMIS forms shall be used in filing out the malaria cases, malaria deaths and vector control activities from the barangays, municipalities/chartered cities and hospitals in every Center for Health Development. 

E. The PhilMIS shall capture the different malaria indicators such as mortality rate, morbidity rate, proportion of uncomplicated and severe malaria, malaria case fatality ratio, proportion of malaria cases by species, speciﬁc age-group, gender, pregnant women; annual parasite incidence, malaria test positivity rate, proportion of patients diagnosed within 24 hours of consultation; proportion of confirmed malaria cases receiving anti-malaria drugs. within 24 hours, proportion of population protected by LLIN and through indoor residual spraying. 

VI. IMPLEMENTING GUIDELINES: 

A. The facilities shall submit their reports using the appropriate reporting forms to the next reporting level on timelines stated on the modiﬁed PhilMIS Standard Operating Guidelines (SOG) as shown in the Data Flow diagram.
