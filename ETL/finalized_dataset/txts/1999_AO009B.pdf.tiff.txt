<subject>SUBJECT: GUIDELINES ON THE MANAGEMENT OF RESEARCHES IN THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH</subject>

<body>

A. RATIONALE

One of the important functions of the Department of Health is the formulation and implementation of the National Health Research Agenda with the end-goal of promoting information- and evidence-based policy formulation and program development. In support of this function, Administrative Order 104-A s. 1991 created an ENHR Unit to provide staff support for the implementation of the ENHR Program.

The various Units/Services/Programs of the Department have their own researches. Most of these researches, however, are conducted by external researchers who respond to the Department’s call for proposals or are commissioned to conduct these researches.

To enable the ENHRP to systematically manage, keep track and facilitate the translation of research findings and recommendations into inputs for policy- and decision-making in the Department, the following guidelines are hereby prescribed.


B. GENERAL GUIDELINES

1. The ENHRP shall be responsible for the overall management of researches in the Department-the Central Office, Regional Field Offices and retained hospitals. As such it shall:

2.2 DOH Services/Programs/Units that will submit research proposals for external funding should first submit the same to the ENHRP for review. The ENHRP, in turn, shall ensure that these proposals are in accordance with the DOH Research Agenda and are evaluated by a Technical Review Panel.

3. All concerned Units/Services/Programs shall inform in writing the ENHRP on the amount of available budget for their research requirements on the first month of the year. The implementation of an approved research project shall be co-managed by the ENHRP and the Units/Service/Program concerned.

4. The ENHRP shall maintain a database of researches in the DOH. It shall maintain/prepare:

4.1 An updated list of completed and ongoing researches in the Department. All Units/Services/Programs are required to submit a list of their completed and ongoing researches at the end of each year.

4.2 An updated list of experts (both content and research methodology) for the different Services/Programs/Specialties. It shall expand its network of experts from different government agencies, NGOs and research and academic institutions. The concerned Units/Programs/Services shall submit to the ENHRP a list of these experts who may be tapped tor review research proposals or commissioned to conduct researches for the Department.

4.3 An updated record of the financial reports of all research projects in the DOH, including those funded by other agencies/organizations.

4.4 An annual report on the researches that were conducted (completed and ongoing) by the different Units/Services/Programs of the DOH and the total amount spent for these researches.
