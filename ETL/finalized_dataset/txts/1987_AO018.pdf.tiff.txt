<doctype>ADMINISTRATIVE ORDER</doctype>
<docnum>No. 18 s. 1987</docnum>
<subject>Subject: Exemption of Personnel Reappointed Under E.O. No. 119 dated January 30, 1987, from the provisions of Administrative Order No. 65 as amended by A.O. No. 79, both series of 1980</subject>
 
<body>
Administrative Order No. 65, as amended by Administrative Order no. 79, both series of 1980, have laid down the Department policy, to restrict the employment of members of a family who are related within the third degree of affinity or consanguinity in the same hospital or office whether or not there is exercise of supervision by one over the other, which is specifically covered by the laws and rules on nepotism. This Department policy has since been upheld by the Merit Systems Board of the Civil Service Commission as within the prescribed authority and discretion of the Secretary of Health

       In View, however, of the substantive structural and functional changes of the DDH'S reorganization under Executive Order No. 119 dated January 30,1987, certain changes have become necessary in the enforcement of this Administrative Order to make its application practical and compassionate in character.

       Accordingly, where an office, bureau, service or hospital has been abolished, transferred, merged with another or reorganized under Executive Order No. 119, such personnel may be reappointed in other organizational units as an exception to the restrictive provisions of Administrative Order No. 65 as amended.

       As thus further amended, Administrative Order No. 65, as modified by Administrative Order No. 79, both series of 1980, stands in effect.

This Order takes effect immediately.
