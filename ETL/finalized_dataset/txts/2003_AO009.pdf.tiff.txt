<body>

Administrative Order No. 173 s. 2002 — “Guidelines for the Implementation of the Matching Grant Program (MGP) 2002-2003” is hereby amended to include the following provisions:

Section “ I . Y2003 Funding and Allocation

1. All 2003 MGP grant release will be held in abeyance pending completion of 2001-02 releases.

2. For LGUs with 2003 MGP release and still with 2001 and/or 2002 MGP grant converted as Account Payables (APs), the Centers for Health Development (Cl-ID) will not release the 2003 MGP grant unless all the 2001-02 MGP-APs have already been released to recipient LGUs.

3. All CHDs with 2001-02 MOP-Al’s are advised to advocate to their respective Department of Budget and Management (DBM) regional ofﬁces the release of the notice of cash allocation (N CA) on the MOP—AP;

4. For CHDs with no pending 2001—02 Al’s, release of Y2003 grant funds for enrollment/re-enrollment of MGP participating LGUS is provided using the allocation for MGP in the CHD budget—LHAD. Allocation for each participating LGU will be determined by the CHD depending on the total available LHAD-MGP budget.

4.1 Expansion to new LGUS will be allowed only in prioritized CHDs with low CPR (CAR, NCR, V, VIII and ARMM)

4.2 For other CHDs, they can opt to enroll new LGUs provided that they have the funds to support their expansion

4.3 Y2003 grant should only be released to participating LGUs as soon as the LGUs are able to submit the required documentations on or before June 30,2003.

J. Support to SS Activities

1. For CHDS that are not able to meet 100% release of their 2001-02 APs on or before June 30,2003 to participating LGUs, the 2003 MGP—LGU grant allocation will instead be used to augment existing regional SS activities, and/or

2. LGUs may avail of the MGP—SS grant, provided that:

2.1 The funds will be used to have at least one of their health facilities certified as SS for the current year (Y2003) andfor

2.2 For LGUs with existing SS certiﬁed facility, the grant shall be used for activities that will ensure that DOH—National Objectives for Health targets on MCHKFP/Nutrition are met.

3. MGP Grant funds used for SS activities shall not be used for construction/ renovation of health facilities and neither for Capital Outlay activities nor for Personal Services.

K. Release of 2001-02 APs before/after June 30, 2003

1. APs released before/after June 30, 2003 will still be used for MGP implementation activities in accordance with their CHD approved plan.

L. CHD Role after release of MGP-APs

1. Assist participating LGUs in updating the regionally approved MGP plans.

2. Assist participating LGUs in program implementation and in meeting the DOH health objectives.

3. Assist participating LGUs in liquidating the grant.

M. 2004 MGP Release

1. Regular conduct of MGP activities shall resume on 2004 . Allocation will still be provided in the CHD-LHAD budget.”

These provisions are added to provide the necessary guidance to the CHDs to fast track grant releases to eligible LGUS. Delayed release of the grants in 2001-02 led to the subsequent classiﬁcation of the grant fund as accounts payable. It is earnestly hoped that CHDs shall fast track regional activities so as to avoid conversion of ﬁnancial assistance to the LGUs to account payables in 2003.

All other provisions of Administrative Order No. 173 s. 2002 remains in force and in effect.
