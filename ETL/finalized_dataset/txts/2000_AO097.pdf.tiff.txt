<subject>SUBJECT: BANNING AND WITHDRAWAL OF CISAPRIDE (REPULSED) FROM THE MARKET</subject>

<body>

isapride, which is marketed as Prepulsid, is a drug used in the treatment of motility related gastrointestinal disorders.

In view of documented reports on adverse drug events, including deaths, that have been associated with the use of Cisapride and its voluntary withdrawal in the US, UK, and other countries, the National Drug Committee of the Department of Health has recommended that Cisapride be withdrawn from the Philippine market.

Therefore, in the interest of consumer protection, it is hereby ordered that: 

1. Cisapride shall no longer be registrable.

2. The registration of all Cisapride (Prepulsid) products be recalled and cancelled

3. The importer/distributor immediately withdraw all existing stocks from drugstores, hospitals, etc. 

This Order shall take effect immediately.
