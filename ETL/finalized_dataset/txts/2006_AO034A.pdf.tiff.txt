<subject>Subject: Amendment of Administrative Order No. 2006-0034 ”Delegation of Authorities for Certain Transactions in the Offices Under the Department of Health" dated October 10, 2006</subject>

<body>
For the past five years, the Department of Health (DOH) had been implementing Republic Act 9184 entitled “An Act Providing for the Modernization, Standardization and Regulation of the Procurement Activities of the Government and for Other Purposes”. In line with its commitment to promote good governance and its effort to adhere to the principle of transparency, accountability, equity, efficiency and economy in the procurement process, the DOH continuously reviews its policies and implements reforms in pursuit of better performance.

The delegation of authorities for certain transactions within the Department of Health particularly on procurement was recently reviewed. To better institute the check and balance in the procurement transactions, there is a need to amend the delegated authority of the Head of the Procuring Entity to the different offices.
Hence, specific provisions of Administrative Order No. 2006—0034 “Delegation of Authorities for Certain Transactions in the Offices Under the Department of Health” dated October 10, 2006 is hereby amended as follows:
