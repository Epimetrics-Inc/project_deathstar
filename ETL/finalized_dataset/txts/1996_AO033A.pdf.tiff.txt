One of the flagship programs is the Comprehensive and Integrated Delivery of Social Services (CIDSS) of which the Department of Health is one of the key implementors. CIDSS primarily seeks to ensure access by target sectors to basic social services such as health and sanitation, education, peace and order, among others.

The Poverty Alleviation Fund fully supports all these initiatives.
