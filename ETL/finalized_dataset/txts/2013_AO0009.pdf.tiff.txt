<body>

I. Rationale/Background: 

Over the past decade there has been a vast increase in the use of chemicals and this trend will continue as chemicals have a direct impact on the economic growth and improved quality of life. Chemical safety and hazardous waste issues have been raised among countries in economic transition and rapid industrialization. However, there are risks associated with the unsafe use of chemicals in commercial and in industrial activities. The extent of their ill—effects on health, ecological damage and resultant economic losses has always been underestimated. 

All chemicals are toxic to some degree, with health risk primarily a function of the severity of the toxicity and the extent of exposure. However, most chemicals have not been adequately tested to determine their toxicity. Only 2% of chemicals produced commercially have complete health hazard assessment while only 14% of all chemicals have sufficient information to support even a partial hazard assessment. The general population is frequently uninformed about the hazards of the exposure to these chemical substances, including the routes of exposure and potential adverse health effects. 

While the Philippines’ Medium Term Development Plan focused on industrialization, agriculture remains a major contributor to the country’s economy. ‘ Data showed that the incidence of poisoning by pesticides comprises 32% of the total poisoning cases reported and it is estimated that about 8—10% of the poisoning cases die every year as a result of intentional, accidental, and occupational exposures (UP-NPMCC, 2011). Furthermore, chronic exposures _ have been linked to other health effects, such as polyneuropathy, dermatitis, behavioral changes, and damage to organ-systems. Pesticide poisoning remains one of the pressing public health problems in many countries in the world, especially those with agriculture-based economies. 
 
The adoption the Strategic Approach to International Chemicals Management under the auspices of the United Nations Environment Programme, the World Health Organization, the International Labor Organization, the Food and Agricultural Organization and other international - organizations at the International Conference on Chemicals Management provides a global framework for countries aiming to achieve the goal of sound chemicals management by 2020. 


Moreover, the Fifty-Ninth World Health Assembly in 2006 adopted a resolution urging member states to take full account of the health aspects of chemical safety in the national implementation of the Strategic Approach to International Chemicals Management. Accordingly, the proposed framework under the Strategic Approach articulated the development of joint action between participating agencies in the spirit of coordination and cooperation through improved dialogue, shared information and expertise on the sound management of chemicals.

IV. Definition of Terms 

 
1. Chemicals - any organic or inorganic substance of a particular molecular identity, including: 

i) Any combination of such substances occurring in whole or in part as a result of chemical reaction or occurring in nature; and 

ii) Any element or uncombined chemical.

2. Chemical mixture - any combination of two or more chemical substances if the combination does not occur in nature and is not, "in whole or in part, the result of a chemical reaction, if none of the chemical substances Comprising the combination is a new chemical substance and if the combination could have been manufactured for commercial purposes without a chemical reaction at the time the chemical substances comprising the combination were combined. This shall include non-biodegradable mixtures.  

3. Exposure - amount of chemical that is available for absorption into the body through possible routes of entry into the body i.e. inhalation, ingestion and skin absorption. 

4. Importation - entry of products or Substances into the Philippines (through the seaports or airports of entry) after having been properly cleared through or still remaining under customs control, the product or substance of which is intended for direct consumption, merchandising, warehousing, or for further processing. 

5. Manufacture - mechanical or chemical transformation of substances into new products whether work is performed by power-driven machines or by hand, whether it is done in a factory or in the worker‘s home, and whether the products are sold at wholesale or retail. 

6. Unreasonable risk - expected frequency of undesirable effects or adverse responses arising from a given exposure to a substance. 

7. Hazards - inherent characteristics of chemical substances and mixtures that are potentially dangerous or which have the capacity to do harm to the health and the environment. 

8. Hazardous substances are substances which present either:

8.1 short-term acute health hazards, such as acute toxicity by ingestion, inhalation or skin absorption, corrosivity or other skin or eye contact hazards (or the risk of fire or explosion; or 

8.2 long-term chronic health hazards which upon repeated exposure can result to any of the folloWing adverse health effects such as cancer, damage to the different organ systems, endocrine disruptors, etc 


9. Poison - any agent capable of producing deleterious effects in a biologic system, seriously injuring function or producing death. 

10. Risk - the potential (likelihood) that injury (biological damage) will occur in a given situation that is, the interaction of hazard (nature/incident) and the vulnerability (man/society).

11. Toxicity — the ability of a substance to cause injury to biologic material 

Guiding Principles 

Precautionary Principle and Prevention. As embodied in the Rio Declaration under Principle 15 states that where there are threats of serious or irreversible damage to the environment, lack of full scientific certainty shall not be used as a reason for postponing . cost-effective measures to prevent enVironmental degradation. In the development of policies and guidelines on chemicals safety, agencies shall consider the importance of precautionary measures in avoiding human health and environmental impacts of new, existing or future chemicals use. Furthermore, concerned agencies shall contribute to the scientific understanding of the links between environmental exposure and human health impacts, and the need to ensure the participation and protection of vulnerable groups, such as women, children, older persons, indigenous populations and socially and economically disadvantaged groups, including equitable provision of comprehensible information. 


2. Workers' Right to Know. The right to health and safety at work has been stipulated in the Constitution of the World Health Organization (WHO) and International Labor Organization (ILO) and is supported by a number of other United Nations documents. This shall cover information on the hazards in their workplaces, confidentiality (privacy) of health information, access to training and education and maintenance of a healthy and safe workplace. 

3. Integrated life-cycle approach. The Plan of Implementation of World Summit on - Sustainable Development proposed the development of production and consumption policies and involves strong controls from the manufacture of a chemical to its storage, transport, treatment, reuse, recycling, recovery and final disposal. It promotes product stewardship which ensures that those who design, manufacture, sell, and use consumer products take responsibility for reducing negative impacts to the economy, and calls on those in the product life cycle manufacturers, retailers, users, and disposers—to extend and share responsibility for reducing the environmental and health impacts of products. It- shall also mandate manufacturers/producers/distributors to take back and recycle products until the end of their useful lives. 

4. Pollution prevention. Taking into account the provisions under Principle 6 of the Declaration of the United Nations Conference on the Human Environment which states that the discharge of toxic substances or of other substances and the release of heat, in such quantities or concentrations as to exceed the capacity of the environment to render them harmless, shall be halted in order to ensure that serious or irreversible damage is not inflicted upon ecosystems. Under Principle 7 of the said Declaration, countries shall take all possible steps to prevent pollution of the seas by substances that are liable to create hazards to human health, to harm living resources and marine life, to damage amenities or to interfere with other legitimate uses of the sea. 

5. Policy Coherence and Governance. Under the guiding principles of sustainable _ development, coherence, harmonization and integration between local, regional, national and global actions to increase their contribution to sustainable development shall be promoted. 

6. Private-Public Partnership. Cooperative venture between the public and private sectors, built on the expertise of each partner, that best meet clearly defined public needs through allocation of resources, risks and rewards shall‘be promoted. 

Other guiding principles and considerations of importance in developing the strategy shall include the promotion of consistency and coherence, building upon and leveraging existing policies, commitments and processes and encouraging the ever-closer coordination and cooperation between stakeholders in a shared framework of action ad synergies. It shall also emphasize on the importance of encouraging closer coordination and cooperation among stakeholders on a shared framework of action. 

VI. Strategic Approach in Ensuring the Implementation of the Program 

A. Strengthening Organizational Structure for Chemical Safety and Toxicology at Different Levels of Governance. 

The Secretary of Health shall be designated as Chair and the Secretary of the Environment and Natural Resources as the Vice—Chair of the Inter-Agency Committee on Environmental Health (IACEH) as stipulated in Executive Order No. 489 signed 22 November 1991. The Environmental and Occupational Health Office of the National Center for Disease Prevention and Control under the Support to Service Delivery Team 11 shall serve as the Secretariat for the IACEH. 

The Sub-sector on Toxic Substance and Hazardous Waste (TSHW) under the IACEH shall be reconstituted and strengthened to include other concerned agencies and serve as the main coordinating body for the implementation of the National Chemical Safety Management Program (see Figure 1).

Academe, industry and non—government organizations 

In cases where technical assistance on environmental and health concerns may be needed, these shall be referred to the Centers for Health Development in the different regions in the country through the Regional Inter-agency Committee on Environmental Health (RIACEH). The Local Government Unit (LGU) shall be encouraged to adopt the structure and composition at the regional/provincial/ municipal/city level. 

C. The TSHW sub-sector under the IACEH shall work towards the implementation of the 

following activities under the programme; 

1. Capacity Building for Personnel .1 Governments, academe and relevant professional bodies shall consider working together to share and optimize the use of existing training materials and possibly extending or adapting them for use in teaching curricula on chemicals including strategic planning, risk assessment and management, _ testing and research and control of illegal traffic and other relevant areas of concern. 

2. Capacity for Risk Assessment, Reduction, Management and Communication - Activities under this part of the health sector strategy shall be focused at increasing actions pertaining to the management of chemicals, thereby stimulating interest and building capacity for broader action to Contribute to the sound management of ' chemicals and the development of action plans to address priority concerns in relation to groups with specific vulnerabilities. Approaches to risk assessment procedures to include sampling procedures, standards, test methods shall be harmonized to include upgrading of capability for accreditation and reference laboratories. Hazard mapping shall be established at the national/regional and local levels. The risk management approach shall utilize health economic. analyses, which take into account the value of health and illness in monetary terms in comparison to benefits from the use of a hazardous chemical or chemical substances.
