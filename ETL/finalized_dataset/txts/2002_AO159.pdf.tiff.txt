I. RATIONALE:

The 1937 Philippine Constitution clearly mandates that the State shall protect and promote the right to health of the people and instill the consciousness among them (Section 15, Article II). The State, under Section II of Article XIII, shall adopt an "integrated and comprehensive approach to health development which shall endeavor to make essential goods, health and other social services available to all the people at affordable cost".

In support of this mandate, the Department of Health (DOH) issued Administrative Order #23-A, dated 03 July 1996, that outlines the guidelines on the development and establishment of Botika ng Barangay and Administrative Order No. 70, dated 03 January 2002, that provides for a licensing procedure for Botika ng Barangays supervised by the Local Government Units. Both DOH issuances show the department's goal in providing tools for the local government units in partnership with non-government and community organizations, to provide quality and affordable drugs to the people. These actions are consistent with the provisions of the Local Government Code that transfers the role of providing essential goods into the hands of the local government units, with the Department of Health providing support and technical assistance.
