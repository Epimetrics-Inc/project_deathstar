<subject>SUBJECT: Updated Guidelines on Neonatal Tetanus Elimination</subject>

<body>

National tetanus (NT) is said to have been eliminated if its incidence is below one (1) case per 1,000 livebirths (WHO definition or NT elimination). In 1990, the Philippines embarked on an NT elimination strategy. As a result, the national NT incidence based on surveillance data is now 0.17/100 livebirths, classifying the Philippines among those which have successfully eliminated neonatal tetanus. However, there are two remaining provinces (Cagayan and Maguindanao) which have reported more than one NT case per 1,000 livebirths in 1997. Furthermore, there may be NT cases which may not have been reported.

To further strengthen the NT elimination campaign, the attached Updated Guidelines on Neonatal Tetanus Elimination is hereby promulgated to guide field health personnel and local government executives. Our national goal is to have zero neonatal tetanus case in every municipality in the country. The nature of the disease tells us that there are selected areas and communities which are at higher risk of neonatal tetanus than others, most notably the tribal minorities. We must make sure the NT elimination services reach these communities.

Crucial to the attainment of the goals of NT Elimination is the use of the tetanus toxoid vaccines for pregnant women and women of child-bearing age. Please be assured that the tetanus toxoid currently used by the Department of Health has been proven to be pure and safe. Several laboratory tests were undertaken to conﬁrm the veracity of previous reports regarding tetanus toxoid efficacy and safety. 

You are strongly enjoined to read these guidelines patiently and religiously. Your close adherence to these guidelines will prevent unnecessary confusion and controversy which only undermine the best of intentions. The bottomline is that health providers should carefully explain the objectives, intentions, and services provided in the NT Elimination campaign so that the target women and their families realize for themselves the value of the services being provided. This can be achieved only through adequate communication and social mobilization.

Let us once again communicate with each other and work together for the sake of our children. 

This order takes effect immediately and rescinds A.O. No. 15 s.1995 dated 7 September 1995.

UPDATED GUIDELINES ON NEONATAL TETANUS ELIMINATION

BACKGROUND:

Neonatal Tetanus or tetanus neonatorum is caused by a bacteria called clostridium tetani which thrives on dead or decaying matter, dirt, feces, necrotic or dead tissues.

The disease usually occurs through introduction via the umbilical cord of tetanus spores during delivery by cutting the cord with an unclean instrument, or after delivery by dressing the umbilical stump with substances heavily contaminated with tetanus spores, frequently as part of natal rituals. It is not directly transmitted from man to man. About 366 neonatal tetanus cases were reported in 1996. A large majority of cases are underreported.

Routine immunization during the routine EPI and during NIDs have resulted in a significant decrease in NNT cases. The Philippines is among the countries in the Western Pacific Region which have achieved a rate of less than one case of NT per 1000 live births annually for the whole country but not in each province or city. Only two remaining provinces has an NT rate of >1/1000 live births.


GOALS/OBJECTIVES:

By year 2004, there will be zero (0) neonatal tetanus case for every province or city. 


INPUT/OBJECTIVES:

By year 2004,

At least 90% TT2+ coverage of all pregnant women.
At least 90% TT2+ coverage of all women aged 15 to 45 years old in high risk areas.


STRATEGIES:

* Immunization of women with tetanus toxoid
* Training of birth attendants in clean delivery practices
* Improved surveillance 


SCOPE AND COVERAGE:

Neonatal tetanus occur everywhere in the Philippines but tend to cluster in certain areas. These areas are considered “high risks” and are the best sites to focus neonatal tetanus (NT) elimination efforts. The "high risk" approach is the rapid and cost effective approach towards neonatal tetanus elimination consisting of five steps: 

1. Identify high risk provinces and areas within provinces i.e. municipalities, barangays 
2. Identify the specific problems in each area that are placing it at risk

3. plan special activities for each area to include an assessment of resources
4. implement the plan 
5. monitor activities through immunization coverage reporting and case reporting 

Certain indicators are used in prioritizing areas for NT elimination. These include: 

* cluster of NT cases
* tetanus toxoid coverage 
* deliveries by untrained birth attendants
* proportion of home deliveries 
* quality of NT surveillance 

Because most NT cases ere not reported routine reports will not provide accurate data for identifying clusters of cases. A more reliable way is to do active NT surveillance. 

NT surveillance is active it all neonatal deaths in the areas are investigated and analyzed to detect eases. Among these deaths high risk areas are classified as follows: 

1. First priority NT high risk areas:

Areas where at least one NT case has been found through active NT surveillance, regardless of reported TT2+ coverage.

2. Secondary priority NT areas:

Areas where no NT case has been reported but where reported TT2+ coverage is less than 80%

3. Third priority NT areas:

Areas where no NT case has been found and where reported TT2+ coverage is >80% but

* where traditional birth attendants (“hilots”), especially untrained TBAs deliver more than 50% of home deliveries, and/or
* there is no active NT surveillance


ACTlVITiEIS FOR THE FIRST PRIORITY NT HIGH RISK AREAS

1. List all NT areas by name/age/exact address/immunization status of mother/place and type of birth. (See Annex )

2. Map all NT cases at barangay and neighborhood levels to identity high risk barangays and puroks
3. Using the existing NT investigation form, investigate all cases. (Annex 2)
4. Identify problems and possible causes.
5. Plan immunization activities, including the logistics (vaccine syringes, immunization cards personnel transport).
6. Conduct intensive social mobilization and IEC to explain the purposes and approaches to the community as a whole.
7. Immunize all women of childbearing age (15 to 45 years).
8. In addition to TT2+ immunization coverage, use the child protected at birth (PAB) indicator to report performance. 
9. Introduce and maintain active NT surveillance integrated into acute flaccid paralysis (AFP) surveillance and link with the regional and central level surveillance systems. 
10. Improve delivery facilities In high risk areas
11. Train all midwives and hilots working in high risk areas


ACTIVITIES FOR THE SECONDARY PRIORITY NT HIGH RISK AREAS

1. List all neonatal deaths between 3 days and 28 days that occurred in the locality by name/age/exact address/immunization status of mother/place and type of birth. (Annex 1) 
2. Investigate all neonatal deaths using the existing NT investigation form. (Annex 2)
3. Identify problems and possible causes.
4. If a neonatal tetanus case is confirmed, conduct activities as in primary priority NT high risk areas
5. If no NT case is confirmed, increase routine immunization coverage to at least 80%
6. In addition to immunization coverage, use the child protected at birth (PAB) indicator to report performance.
7. Monitor the area and maintain active NT surveillance


ACTIVITIES FOR THE THIRD PRIORITY NT HIGH RISK AREAS

1. Maintain 80% TT2+ coverage of pregnant women. 
2. Train 100% of all TBAs on clean deliveries in the locality
3. Increase antenatal care to 4 antenatal visits for each pregnant woman in the locality.

The succeeding topics describe the "How To’s” of the activities.


What are the immunization activities for neonatal elimination?

Routine immunization of pregnant women:

Pregnant women are the priority target for TT; they should have received at least two doses before delivery. In high risk areas especially, immunization should be extended to the full 5—dose schedule (see Table 1, Immunization Schedule) to protect women for their entire childbearing life. Immunization should be given after screening women and checking their TT immunization status. All doses of TT received should be recorded in a register and tetanus toxoid personal immunization cards should be issued to all women who receive TT immunization.

TABLE 1 TETANUS TOXOID IMMUNIZATION SCHEDULE

Supplementary immunization of pregnant women aged 15-45 in high risk area:

As a long term policy, all women of childbearing age in high risk areas should be immunized. 

Depending upon the local situation, different strategies can be adopted the high NT risk in the areas, such as offering TT immunization at routine EPI sessions or having fixed outreach or mobile teams to raise immunization coverage. Create “women immunization weeks" or conduct house-to-house campaigns if necessary. Increase women’s awareness of the benefits of tetanus toxoid immunization.

Always check the immunization status of women and avoid giving extra doses than they actually request. Side reactions to TT vaccination were associated With more than 5 doses of TT received. Immunization cards with doses received should be given.


How should we do neonatal tetanus surveillance? 

Many cases of neonatal tetanus are never reported. In order to “catch” as many possible NT cases all likely cases of NT should be reported. For the purpose of surveillance, the following standard definitions are adopted:

Suspected Case:

Any neonatal death between 3 and 26 days of age in which the cause of death is unknown or any neonatal death in a child who could suck and cry normally during the first 48 hours of life.

Confirmed Case: 

Any neonate who:

* has normal cry and suck for the first 2 days, and
* cease sucking from three days, and
* developed stiffness (generalized muscle rigidity) and/or spasms and/or convulsions after third day

Active surveillance for NT should be integrated into the existing and well functioning AFP reporting system. Surveillance staff should include NT reporting at the time of the regular monthly visits to sentinel sites.

Reporting of NNT at all levels should be promoted for identification of areas of continued high risk. Sentinel sites surveillance alone is unsuitable for NNT elimination because it will not detect cases occurring at home without medical consultation and will incorrectly attribute high risk to districts that have referred to hospitals.

Suspected cases should be reported immediately and each case should be investigated. The reasons for not reporting should be taken.

Summary data of confirmed cases should be included in routine monthly surveillance reports and should be reported as a separate item from other (non-neonatal tetanus).


How do we do active search of NT cases? 

All neonatal deaths, between 3 days and 28 days, shall be investigated within 2 weeks upon receipt of report of neonatal death occurred in the locality.

Active search shall be a routine monthly activity of the health facility.

There are several ways this can be done: 

1. inquiry from the community about any neonatal deaths within the area 
2. review hospital record i.e. monthly hospital statistical reports 
3. review civil registry records 


What actions should be taken when NNT is identified? 

* Investigate case and confirm the diagnosis 
* Conduct case response immunization to increase TT2+ immunization coverage in population at risk. Screening of immunization status of women, giving the necessary doses after recording and distribution of immunization cards are crucial steps. The target groups to be immunized in the village or a wider areas if resources permit are:

- the mother of the case
- pregnant women 
- childbearing age women
- school children or school girls if possible

* Search for NNT cases in neighboring localities 
* Promote TT immunization and clean deliveries in the area 
* Identify and solve problems related to clean deliveries and immunization
* Identity birth attendant, whether trained staff or TBA and offer refresher training in clean delivery techniques 
* Implement corrective measures to prevent further cases.


How should we monitor and evaluate neonatal tetanus elimination activities? 

Protected at birth (PAB) is the preferable method of determining coverage particularly where TT2+ coverage is unreliable.

To monitor the % of children protected at birth, the health personnel during the  first contact (possibly for DPT or BCG) should record whether the infant was protected at birth by mother’s TT status by asking the number of TT doses the mother has received. The column “PAB” can be added to children immunization register book. 

Formula:

Numerator = infants whose mothers were protected by TT which is defined as 

* a two (2) doses of TT during pregnancy with the child or
* at least three (3) doses at any time in the past including this pregnancy

Denominator = target population for immunization, children under one year of age 

Definition of protected:

Either the:

* Mother has received three or more doses of TT at any other time in the past, or
* Mother has received two doses of TT during the pregnancy with the child

Definition of not protected:

Mother does not know or remember the immunization status
Mother has not received TT 
Mother has received only one dose of TT
Mother received less than two doses of TT in the last pregnancy

If the child is unprotected the mother should receive a dose of TT during the same visit

Tetanus Toxoid Immunization Cards 

Long term records are needed in order to monitor the immunization coverage for TT and avoid extra doses. Immunization records, like the tetanus toxoid immunization cards of women should be used for recording and aggregating TT doses given to each woman during pregnancy and when not pregnant.

All women who receive TT immunization should be issued TT immunization cards

Provincial line listing of all NT cases:

Line listing of all NT cases by provinces/cities would indicate the high-risk areas for close monitoring. Analyzing the data gathered through case investigation would guide in planning the future activities.

Selected indicators to be monitored for Neonatal Tetanus Elimination (NTE) program

* Incidence of NNT (NT rate)
* % of AFPI reporting sites that report NT with AFP 
* % of provinces/cities reporting every month
* % of provinces/cities with high risk districts identified
* % of reported neonatal tetanus cases that are investigated 
* % of "silent districts" that have had active search
* % of NT cases that have followed by an immunization response and active search in the area.
