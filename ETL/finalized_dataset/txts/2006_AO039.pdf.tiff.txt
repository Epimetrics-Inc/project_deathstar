I. RATIONALE

In order to enhance the physical and financial accessibility of essential drugs and medicines (EDM) commonly dispensed to the public as a commitment of our Government in the State of the Nation Address (SONA), the Department of Health (DOH) has explored innovative ways to achieve that commitment. Among the courses of action that was projected as viable alternative in bringing into realization such commitment is the procurement of drugs through consignment method.

The consignment strategy is provided under Administrative Order No. 5 s. 2003, also known as Guidelines and Procedure for the institutionalization of the Department of Health Drug Consignment System. Under the said A.O., DOH Hospitals are allowed to enter into a Drug Consignment Agreement with legitimate manufacturers/suppliers which have the capability to meet the demands of the Hospital for essential drugs and medicine in a sustainable manner. The advantages of the said system are:

1) It will enhance the availability of low-cost, high quality drugs and medicines in DOH hospital pharmacies, without entailing additional cost or investment on the part of the government;

2) The income that hospitals will earn from the direct sales of these drug products may be used for the improvement of hospital operations, thereby improving healthcare services;

3) Funds allotted for the procurement of supplies and medicines will be freed up and may be utilized for other equally important needs of the hospitals;

4) Even with mark-up by the hospitals, the prices of these consigned medicines will still be lower compared to private outlets. This situation may provide healthy competition with nearby private retailers and may therefore prompt them to lower drug prices as well;

5) No budgetary allotment and notification of cash allocation are required in these transactions since payment will be based on actual drug sales of the respective hospital pharmacies, decreasing red tape in the use thereof;

6) Optimum waste and inventory management as a result of the mechanism to return unused medicines within the agreed period or gee-consequence of the available shelf—life.

However, after reviewing the current system for consignment, it was observed that imperfections in the market have consequent effects on the roles and processes at each level of the organizational structure. It was observed that factors like: a) existence of local or satellite branch of pharmaceutical suppliers; b) willingness of the pharmaceutical suppliers to enter into a consignment agreement; c) peculiar drug needs of individual DOH Hospital; and
d) delivery time, have great impact on the availability and prices of drugs.

Further, the consignment system of the DOH was limited only to DOH Hospitals.
There is a strong clamor to apply the same system under similar activities regulated and initiated by the Centers for Health Development (CHDs) specific to Botika ng Barangays.

Cognizant of the said areas for consideration and the existing technical and administrative capability and expertise of the DOH Hospitals and the CHDs, the need to revise A. O. No. 5, s. 2003, by decentralizing certain functions performed at the DOH Central Office level, and thereby empowering the abovementioned entities Administrative Order No
145 s. 2004 entitled Revised Policies and Guidelines for the institutionalization and Decentralization of the DOH Drug Consignment System was issued. The creation of the said administrative issuance resulted in several consignment agreements entered by DOH Hospitals and pharmaceutical suppliers. However, issues and questions were raised on the manner the subject issuance is implemented especially on areas with varying interpretation.
As such, this Order is issued to address these issues and questions by clarifying and amending certain provisions of Administrative Order No. 145 s. 2004.

ll. PURPOSE AND OBJECTIVES

The purpose of this Order is to establish guidelines and procedures to ensure the availability and relative affordability of essential drugs and medicines (EDM) through a consignment system administered by DOH Hospitals and other health units that may be explicitly authorized by the DOH as the need arises.

The objectives of this Order are as follows:

1. To provide time—bound systems and procedures that would establish the
DOH Drug Consignment System (DOHDCS);

2. To define the attendant roles and responsibilities of prospective Consignor and Consignee;

3. To provide safeguards that would ensure that the system is within the framework of existing rules and regulations on procurement used by the
Government in general and by the DOH in particular; and

4. To amend specific provisions of Administrative Order No. 145 s. 2004

III. SCOPE AND COVERAGE

This Order shall be applicable to all DOH Hospitals and other health units nationwide that may be explicitly authorized by the DOH as the need arises.

IV. DEFINITION OF TERMS

1. Consignor - A duly accredited supplier that undertakes to place its goods on consignment basis at the pharmacy of the Consignee.

2. Consignee- A DOH Hospital or health unit that accepts the goods subject of consignment, delivered by the Consignor, and sells the same to the public at a reasonable and affordable price.

3. Consignment — a method of assuring availability of stocks wherein the Consignor places its goods at the pharmacy of the Consignee for sale, and the former being paid by the latter for only the actual quantity consumed using the money generated from the sale of the consigned goods within an agreed period of time.

4. Registration Certificate/Requirement — a certificate issued by the DOH which that indicating that a supplier is listed in the Simplified Supplier Registry System (SSRS).

5. Consigned Drugs and Medicines — are drugs and medicines which the Consignor delivers to the Consignee under a consignment agreement.

6. Replenishment Drugs and Medicines — are drugs and medicines which the
Consignor delivers to the Consignee as replenishment for those previously sold by the Consignee or as replacement to delivered goods, which expiration date results to a remaining shelf—life not allowable by the DOH, or as replacement to delivered goods, which deterioration are beyond the control of the Consignee.

7. Consignment Order — a Consignee-accomplished form, which directs the
Consignor to effect the delivery of specific drugs and medicines with the corresponding required quantities as determined by the Consignee within the applicable period of time.

8. Prevailing market price — is operationally defined in this Order as the average price of a drug obtained from at least three (3) leading retail drugstore/drug outlet chains, i.e. those endowed with natural economies of scale for bulk procurement, within an administrative region and within the month a price offer is submitted or as may be determined by the National Drug Policy Staff Essential Drug Price Monitoring Unit.

GENERAL GUIDELINES

1. The DOH shall establish the Central Office Drug Consignment System Steering and Oversight Committee (CO-DCSSOC). It shall be responsible in the monitoring of operations of DOH Hospitals and other health units that may opt to undertake drug consignment activities. Specifically, CO-DCSSOC shall monitor the determination of Consignors, essential drugs and medicines to be consigned and allowable price of consigned goods by the said entities.

7. The DOH Hospitals and other health units shall be authorized to execute the appropriate Drug Consignment Agreement with a responsive Consignor whose specific goods were determined as having the lowest calculated and most reasonable price offer among those who participated in the Invitation to Submit Price Offer conducted by the same. The most reasonable price offer is determined by an acceptable price monitoring mechanism.

8. The price of Consigned Goods shall in no case be higher than the selling price of generic essential drugs and medicines procured through the DOH-Philippine International Trading Corporation (PITC) parallel importation scheme or the prevailing market price whichever is lower.
