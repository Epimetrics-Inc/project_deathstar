SUBJECT: Guidelines on Strengthening Laboratory Conﬁrmation of Suspected Measles Cases</subject>

<body>
I. BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE

In 2005, the countries of the Western Paciﬁc Region of the World Health Organization (WHO) adopted the goal of measles elimination. To achieve this, the WHO recommends that countries strengthen three areas of their Expanded Programme for Immunization. These areas are: 1) universal high population immunity through increased coverage; 2) high case-based quality surveillance; and 3) adequate laboratory support for conﬁrmation of diagnosis.

World Health Organization guidelines in support of the goal of measles elimination state that any person satisfying the suspect case deﬁnition of measles shall be immediately reported, investigated and a blood specimen collected to conﬁrm whether the suspected case is indeed a case of measles. Effective surveillance for measles entails establishing case-based surveillance that includes investigation and laboratory testing of specimens from all suspected cases. Such surveillance system will also identify rubella cases through laboratory conﬁrmation. As the country progresses towards measles elimination, reporting of rubella cases will be implemented and incorporated into the measles surveillance system.

The laboratory plays an important role in measles surveillance. In the elimination phase, it is well established that surveillance based on clinical recognition of cases is inaccurate and that laboratory conﬁrmation of all suspected cases is critical for effective surveillance and proper program planning. It is in this light that conﬁrmation of suspected measles cases through laboratory testing needs to be
enhanced. 

1. Monitoring and verifying virus transmission:

-Conﬁrmation of suspect cases/ outbreaks: conﬁrm the clinical
diagnosis, especially in the early stages of an outbreak

-Identiﬁcation of measles and rubella virus strains and genetic
characteristics of Viral isolates

-Differentiate endemic or imported cases: monitor circulation of wild genotypes to deﬁne pathways of transmission! importation


2. Monitoring susceptibility proﬁle of the population

-Determination of the age distribution of susceptibility to measles and
rubella in order to assess population at risk and appropriate
intervention to reduce risk.

-Evaluation of the impact of the immunization campaigns

Quality measles surveillance requires laboratory conﬁrmation of at least 80% of the reported suspected measles cases. However, during elimination phase, all suspected measles cases require laboratory conﬁrmation. This shall serve as the evidence of the country’s achievement and maintenance of the elimination status.

11. OBJECTIVES 

A. General Objective:

This administrative issuance sets the guidelines for strengthening laboratories in support of the goal of measles elimination.

B. Speciﬁc Objectives:

-To strengthen measles case-based surveillance

-To strengthen detection of rubella cases through measles surveillance and laboratory conﬁrmation

-To establish the use of dried blood spot (DB8) and nasopharyngeal swab (NPS) as other methods of conﬁrming suspect cases

-To implement standards for the collection, handling, storage and transport of DB8 and NPS samples

V. DECLARATION OF POLICIES

A. Global Immunization Vision Strategy (GIVS) proposed a new measles ' mortality reduction of 90% by 2010 with the following major challenges: (i) measles mortality reduction activities in several large countries with high measles burden, (ii) enhanced efforts are needed to improve immunization systems to ensure that at least 95% of infants are vaccinated with measles
before their ﬁrst birthday, (iii) continue conduct “follow-up” SIAs every 3-4 years until their routine system are capable of providing two opportunities for measles immunization to >90% of every birth cohort, (iv) disease surveillance at district, provincial and national levels need to be strengthened to enable case-based surveillance with testing of clinical specimens from suspected cases in the laboratories. This was endorsed in the World Health Assembly 2005

B. In 1996, the Regional Ofﬁce of the Western Paciﬁc (WPRO) established a “Plan of Action (POA) for Accelerated Measles Control”. By 2003, the region’s vision had moved to elimination with the publication of the “Western Paciﬁc Regional FDA for Measles Elimination”, that covered the years 2003- 2005. The Regional Ofﬁce published the Field Guidelines for Measles Elimination in 2004 and in 2005, a second Regional Committee (RC) resolution established 2012 as the target date for measles elimination '

C. In light of the proven efﬁcacy and safety of the Regional Advisory (RA) 27/3 bases rubella vaccine, WHO recommends its use in all countries where control or elimination of Congenital Rubella Syndrome (CRS) is considered a public health priority. Current efforts in global measles control shall be used as an opportunity to pursue control of rubella through the use of Measles Rubella (MR) and Measles Mumps Rubella (MMR) vaccines

D. WHO—UNICEF comprehensive strategy for reducing measles mortality among priority countries with the following goals: (i) achieving and maintaining high coverage (>90%) of the lSt dose of measles—containing Vaccine (MCVl) among all children by the age of 12 months in every district through routine immunization services, (ii) ensuring that all children receive a second opportunity for measles immunization, (iii) enhancing measles surveillance with integration of epidemiological and laboratory information, and (iv) providing appropriate clinical management for measles cases 

VI. IMPLEMENTING MECHANISM

The primary function of the laboratory in measles surveillance is conﬁrming suspect measles cases, either through serology, molecular detection of the virus or virus isolation. The testing of serum specimen for the presence of anti—measles IgM antibodies remains the gold standard for laboratory conﬁrmation of suspect cases occurring both sporadically, in clusters or during outbreaks. Other means of conﬁrmation includes testing of DBS for presence of anti-measles IgM antibodies and/or culture and isolation of measles virus from suspect or clinically conﬁrmed measles cases.

In countries with measles elimination goal and implementing case-based surveillance, the recommendation is to collect either serum or DBS specimen within the ﬁrst 28 days of rash onset from all suspect measles cases. While the collection of NPS/ OPS specimen for viral isolation must be within the ﬁrst 5 days of rash onset. Viral isolation provides evidence of elimination of indigenous measles virus, including outbreak source and transmission pathways.

A. Laboratory Procedures for Case Conﬁrmation

1. Use of Serum Samples for IgM testing

A single serum sample obtained at the ﬁrst contact with the patient at any time within 28 days after rash onset shall be taken from ALL suspected measles @. Serum sample collection remains the GOLD STANDARD for conﬁrming suspect cases under surveillance. Measles-speciﬁc IgM antibodies appear within
the ﬁrst few days of rash onset and decline rapidly after one month. Specimen shall be sent to RITM within 72 hours after collection with the completely ﬁlled~ up Measles Case Investigation Form (Annex A.).

Provided that the epidemiological linkage among cases has been
established within a household, specimen shall be taken from the index case (ﬁrst person that ﬁt the case deﬁnition of suspected measles case).

In line with this, it is very important to identify accurate information regarding the exposure history of suspect measles case. The CIF shall contain basic epidemiological information on time, date, place and history of contact with a known measles case. This will help identify origin and path of measles virus transmission.

Patients admitted at hospital facilities and those DRUs (RHU/Health Centers) that have the capacity to collect, store and transport shall have serum sample collected. Procedures for collection, storage and transport of sample are contained in the Annex B.

2. Use of alternative sample (dried blood spot)

Dried blood spot samples shall only be used as an alternative means of specimen collection where there is difﬁCulty in extracting blood (e.g. very young infants, no medical technologist or certiﬁed phlebotomist), maintaining the
specimen at 2-8°C during storage and transport (i.e. selected island barangays, municipalities or RHUs, and provinces, lack of specimen storage facilities and no local courier). Collection shall be done by medical, paramedical and other trained personnel (doctors, medical technologists, nurses, midwives, etc).

3. Use of Oropharygeal and/or Nasopharyngeal swab for virus isolation

To monitor transmission pathways of measles virus during outbreaks, it is important to collect sample for viral isolation and characterization. Oropharyngeal and Nasopharyngeal swab (OPS/NPS) are the most appropriate specimens for virus isolation, OPS/NPS shall be collected as soon as possible within ﬁve (5) days of rash onset from any cluster of suspected measles cases. The probability that the measles virus can be isolated is highest during the ﬁrst 3 days of rash

 

In collecting NPS, the response team shall consider the guide below in collecting samples of cases in a cluster/ outbreak:

-3 cases - collect at least 1-2 samples

-5 cases - collect a minimum of 3 samples

-10 cases — collect a minimum of 5 samples
->=10 cases — collect a minimum of 10 samples

Viral isolation is signiﬁcant to conﬁrm whether the transmissions of indigenous measles strains have been fully eliminated or not. This will certify if the country has achieved the measles elimination goal.

Single or sporadic measles case with history of travel or unknown history of travel shall be collected with samples for both IgM testing (eg. Serum or DB S) and viral isolation (NPS) to determine transmission pathway and differentiate between importation and indigenous transmission.

Nasopharyngeal swab (NPS)

1. Using a ﬂexible Dacron or Rayon tip swab, measure from the base of the nostril towards the auditory pit. Divide the length into half in order to know into what extent will be inserted into the nostril (usually 5—6 cm in adults) to ensure that it reaches the posterior pharynx.

2. With the patient seated, tilt the head slightly backwards. Insert the swab into the nostril parallel to the palate.

3. Rotate swab applying a little force taking large quantities of mucosa.

4. Repeat procedure in the other nostril using the same swab (if possible)

5. Place the nasopharyngeal swab immediately in the VTM tube to avoid drying of the swab.

6. Break/cut with scissors the end of the swab that sticks out of the tube and close the tube.

Oropharyngeal swab (OPS)

1. With gloved hands, hold down the tongue with a sterile tongue depressor.

2. Have the patient say "aahh” to elevate the uvula.

3. Use a sweeping motion to swab the posterior pharyngeal wall and tonsilar pillars. Apply a little force, taking large quantities of mucosa.

4. Avoid swabbing the soft palate and do not touch the tongue with the swab tip. (N .B.this procedure can induce the gag reﬂex)

5. Place the oropharyngeal swab immediately in the same VTM tube with the nasopharyngeal swab.

6. Break/cut with scissors the end of the swab that sticks out of the tube and close
