I. RATIONALE 

Administrative Order No. 2010-0031, the 2010 — 2016 Philippine Plan of Action to Control TB (PhilPACT) serves as the roadmap of the National Tuberculosis Control Program (NT P) to address the problem of tuberculosis in the country. ‘ The over—arching program strategy - is Directly. Observed Treatment Short Course Strategy (DOTS). One of the PhilPACT’s- eight strategies is to engage all providers of TB services. By 2016, it targets that 90% public hospitals and 65% private hospitals are participating in TB control efforts under the direction of NTP. 

Hospitals are major providers of tuberculosis (TB) care. The 2007 National TB Prevalence Survey showed that 43% of patients with signs and symptoms of TB consulted hospitals. HOSpital participation, however, in TB control efforts is very limited. In 2010, a survey of 14 public hospitals in Metro Manila showed that they detected around 12,500 TB cases a year but only 5% were reported to the NTP. Many studies. showed that management of TB in hospitals is not consistent with the policies. and guidelines of the NTP and. the International Standards of TB. Care. 

In 1997, the Department of Health (DOH) issued AO no. 24-A s. 1997 on implementing the hospital-based TB control program in DOH—owned hospitals. It was later amended in 2004 through AO no 140 s. 2004 expanding the coverage to all government hospitals. In 2003, the Philippine Health Insurance Corporation (PhilHealth) introduced the TB-DOTS cut- patient beneﬁt package. However, by 2013 only less than 25% of around 1,800 hospitals are implementing the TB control program. Furthermore, the NTP Manual of Procedures 5th edition had been recently issued changing key technical policies and guidelines. It is within ' this context that this administrative order is being issued. This set of guidelines had been ’ tested through the World Health Organization (WHO)/Canadian International Development Agency-assisted—Collaboration for Additional TB Cases from Hospitals TB cases (CATCH- TB) project (2009 — 2013) in 17 public hospitals in Metro Manila and the Philippine Tuberculosis Society/Linking Initiatives and Networking to Control TB (TBLINC)/USAID- supported System for an Enhanced, Comprehensive, Uniﬁed Referral, Recording and Reporting for TB (SECURE TB) project (2011 ”2012) in 38 private hOSpitals nationwide. 

II. OBJECTIVES 

This Order aims to; 

A. Provide the policies and guidelines on implementing patient-centered TB-DOTS in all - hospitals. 

B. Highlight key technical policies in managing TB cases in the hospitals. 

C. Describe the NTP recording and reporting system for hospitals. 

D. Deﬁne the roles and responsibilities of stakeholders. 

III. SCOPE or APPLICATION 

This Order covers all DOTS facilities in public and private hospitals. This further covers all ofﬁces of the Department of Health and health ofﬁces of the Local Government Units (LGUs). - 

IV  DEFINITION OF TERMS 

A. DOTS Strategy — the over-arching TB control strategy consisting of (a) availability of quality-assured sputum examination; (b) uninterrupted supply of anti-TB drugs; (c) supervision of drug intake; (d) patient and program monitoring, and (e) political will. 

B. DOTS facility - a health care facility, whether public or private, that provides TB-wDOTS services in accordance with the policies and guidelines of the NTP. 

C. Engaged hospital -— a public or private hospital implementing DOTS and reporting to NTP. 

D. TB-DOTS Providing Hospital (TDPH) -— an engaged hospital that has a TB clinic that registers, treats and notiﬁes TB cases and with functional internal and external TB referral systems. 

E. TB DOTS Referring Hospital (TDRH) —— an engaged hospital that has a functional system of ensuring that presumptive TB and diagnosed TB cases are successfully referred to other DOTS facilities. 

F. Presumptive TB— any person whether adult or child with signs and/or symptoms suggestive of TB whether pulmonary or extra—pulmonary, or those with chest x—ray ﬁndings suggestive of active TB. 

G. Presumptive Drug Resistant-TB (DRTB) —— any person, whether adult or child, who belongs to any of the DR-TB high-risk groups: such as re~treannent cases, new TB cases that are contacts of conﬁrmed DR-TB cases or non-converter of Category 1, and people living with HIV with signs and symptoms of TB. 

H. TB disease/TB case —— a presumptive TB case who after clinical and diagnostic evaluation is conﬁrmed to have TB. Based on bacteriological conﬁrmation, these includes the following: 

 
-Bacteriologically conﬁrmed - a TB patient from whom a biological specimen is positive by smear microscopy, culture or rapid diagnostic tests (such as Xpert MTB/RIF). 

-Clinically diagnosed - a TB patient who does not fulﬁl the criteria for bacteriological conﬁrmation but has been diagnosed with active TB by a clinician or other medical practitioner who has decided to give the patient a full course of TB treatment. This deﬁnition includes cases diagnosed on the basis of x—ray abnormalities or suggestive histology, and extra-pulmonary cases without laboratory conﬁrmation. 

I. Childhood TB — is TB disease! TB case in any person who is less than 15 years old. 

J. Internal referral system — a system of referral within a hospital er clinics (e.g. a multi- specialty or polyclinic). This involves referral from the wards, outpatient department or other departments to the hOSpital TB team. 

K. External Referral system process of referral from one health facility to another facility or institution (e. g. hospital to health center, health center to PMDT facility, jail to health center)
