Due to the globalization of industry and health care, and in order to be globally competitive, Overseas Filipino Workers Clinics/Hospitals in the Philippines must provide high quality medical services to their clients, such as the Overseas Filipino Workers applicants. Health Professionals have an ethical and moral obligation to render the best possible medical services.

In order to ensure the delivery of high quality health services to the OFW applicants and to reiterate the DOH stand on rebates as previously stated in the DOH BLR Circular No. 1-s, 1990 dated June 18,1990 and in compliance with the GCC States requirement that only GCC accredited medical clinics/hospitals examination results will be honored by their respective embassies, said OFW applicants should be decked or equally distributed in blocks of ten (10), whenever practicable, among the GCC accredited medical clinics/hospitals in the Philippines collectively known as the GCC Approved Medical Centers Association, Inc. (GAMCA).

There shall be an ovemight committee composed of representatives from the DOH, DOLE and DFA to be Chaired by DOH, to address policy issues and concerns pertaining to the OFW applicants being examined by GAMCA.

Each GAMCA medical clinic/hospital shall provide free and adequate vehicles to transport the OFW applicants for medical examination to their respective assigned medical clinics/hospitals giving top priority to those fasting applicants.

The GAMCA Center, which is the central office for the referral system, shall start its office hours beginning at 6:00 AM. to avoid overfasting among the applicants and to accommodate those coming from distant provinces.

In the event that an Overseas Filipino Worker will be repatriated due to erroneous medical examination results, GAMCA shall be held liable, and shall pay for the repatriation and other expenses incurred in the processing of his application.

This shall take effect immediately upon approval.
