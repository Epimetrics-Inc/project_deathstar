<body>
Effective immediately, the assignments for a 3-months Community Service of graduating residents training under P.D. 1424 as provided by Administrative Order No. 60 s. 1979 is hereby temporarily deferred until further notice. All Ministry Orders pertaining to Community Service assignments previously issued shall stand in effect and should be followed for the interest of the service.

Henceforth, all Chiefs of Hospitals with accredited Teaching and Training Programs shall give more emphasis and direction in the implementation of the one year Post-Residency service as provided by Administrative Order No. 60 s. 1979. The following guidelines shall be observed to ensure strict implementation of the one year post-residency service.

1) The Chief of Hospital is required to submit to Medical Manpower Development Committee the names of all residents in their last year of residency with date of their last appointment, the specialty of their training and suggested place if any for one year post-residency assignment. This must be submitted in the first month of their last year of training. Names of residents who may eventually be taken in by their respective Teaching and Training hospitals should also be submitted to Medical Manpower Development Committee.

2) The Chief of Hospitals are to submit not later than December 31 and July 31 of each year the current roster of medical staff (Medical Specialist, Senior Resident and training Residents) including all vacant items by department, indicating the plantilla numbers as prepared by the Training Officer or Personnel Officer.

3) Graduating residents shall then be assigned by the Ministry for a one year appointment to vacant items of Senior Resident or Medical Specialist. The appointment papers should be processed, even prior to completion of their residency, at their last 2 months.

4) The Chief of the Hospital where the graduate resident served his one year post-residency service shall send certification of completion of the one year service to the Medical Manpower Development Committee for recording, monitoring purposes and eventual issuance of Certificate (Part V, No. 1 of Administrative Order No. 60 s. 1979).

The fully trained physician serving his one year post-residency term is expected to complement and further upgrade the capability and skill of the clinical department he is serving.
