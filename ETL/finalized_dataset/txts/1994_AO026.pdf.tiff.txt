<subject>PHASING OUT OF FREE STANDING BLOOD BANK OUTLETS</subject>
    
<body>In View 6 of the findings of the Committee that conducted an evaluation of the safety of the Philippine Blood Banking System that unregulated Operations of outlets of Free-Standing Commercial Blood Banks greatly threaten the safety of the Blood ﬂanking
System, the Department of Health through the Bureau of Research and Laboratories is phasing out the operations of Free-Standing Blood Outlets.

       Pursuant to the above, all owners and pathologists of Free-Standing Blood Banks are hereby directed to stop the operations of blood bank outlets within 7 days upon approval of this Order. All blood units presently stored and kept at these outlets should therefore be immediately recalled by their respective main or mother blood banks. In addition, this year, no license for the operation of blood bank outlets shall be renewed.
       
       	Henceforth, all requests for blood transfusion shall be coursed through licensed hospital laboratories or blood banks that will be in-charge of sourcing the blood either from voluntary blood donors, the Philippine National Red Cross or from licensed blood banks.
       	The penalties under R.A. 1517 and A.O. 57, s. 1989 shall be imposed for any violation of this Order.
       All health personnel and public are strictly enjoined to monitor the implementation of this Order.
       	This Order takes effect upon approval.
