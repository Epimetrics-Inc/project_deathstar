<subject>SUBJECT: Regulation Part B-FOOD, Sub-part 8 - Packaging 8.1 Prescribing the Packaging of Sugar for Direct Consumption.</subject>

<body>
It has been observed that the use of woven bags for packing refined or brown sugar, intended for retail sale, is insanitary and constitutes a serious hazard, since the sugar in this form is ready for direct consumption.

Woven bags are such that fine particles of dirt and other harmful substances like powdered chemicals, tiny insects, mold spores, and liquids, such as rodent's urine, can penetrate easily to contaminate the contents.

The hazard is further aggravated by the fact that in the process of handling, the containers are oftentimes dragged on the flooring of transport vehicles and of warehouses, or transported, or stored side by side with harmful substances.

In accordance with the primary objectives of the Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, and in order to protect the consumers from adulterated or contaminated food, sugar in any form, intended for direct consumption or manufacturing purposes, as in beverages or confectionery, or for retailing in small quantities, shall be packed in containers of impervious material.

To accomplish this end, the following regulations covering the use of containers for sugar, are hereby promulgated:

1. Sugar intended for direct consumption, either for manufacturing purposes or for retail sale, filled in 100 lbs. and smaller sizes, should be packed in suitable sealed, impervious containers or bags, of sufficient bursting strength and durability, to insure complete protection during transit and storage, under normal conditions.

Containers made of woven materials may also be used, provided that such containers or bags shall conform to the foregoing conditions stated in the first paragraph, either by lamination, or an approved method.

2. All sugar in package form shall be labeled to conform with requirements of the Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act (R.A. 3720), which are as follows:

a. Name of Product: Refined Sugar, Brown Sugar, etc.
b. Net Weight in metric system; and
c. Name and address of manufacturer, packer or distributor.

Violation of these regulations will constitute misbranding or adulteration, as the case may be, and shall be subject to penalties under the law.

This regulation shall take effect one hundred twenty days after publication in the Official Gazette.
