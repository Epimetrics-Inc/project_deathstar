I. BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE

The World Health Organization (WHO) Report of 2003 showed that mental, neurological and substance use disorders are leading causes of disability worldwide and are responsible for 33 percent of overall years lived with disability (YLDs). These disorders also contribute largely to the global burden of disease representing 13 percent of overall disability-adjusted life years (DALYs). More than 150 million people suffer from depression at any point in time and nearly 1 million commit suicide every year. About 25 million suffer from schizophrenia, 38 million from epilepsy, and more than 90 million from alcohol or drug abuse disorders.

Moreover, it is estimated that mental health problems and mental illness will affect more than 20% of the adult population in their lifetime and between 10-15% of young people in any one year. Many will recover spontaneously and of the remainder, the vast majority can be treated and will fully recover. However, a smaller number of people will experience longer periods of distress and disability.

Recognizing the public health impact of mental illness, the WHO‘ has identiﬁed mental health as a global priority. It adopted mental health as the theme for World Health Day 2001 and the focused subject for the World Health Report for 2001. It has increased its support to countries undertaking interventions to improve mental health and thereby reduce the burden of mental illness. WHO developed the Regional Strategy for Mental Health to serve as guidelines in the formulation of policies and programs designed to respond to the challenges posed by mental health problems.

In the Philippine setting, the disability survey done in 2000 by the National Statistics Ofﬁce (NSO) found put that mental illness was the 3rd most common form of disability in the country. The prevalence rate of mental disorders was 88 cases per 100,000 population and was highest among the elderly group. This ﬁnding was supported by a more recent data from the Social Weather Station Survey commissioned by DOH in 2004. It reveals that 0.7 percent of the total households have a family member afﬂicted with mental disability. The Baseline Survey for the National Objectives for Health in 2000 stated that the more frequently-reported symptoms of an underlying mental health problem were sadness, confusion, forgetfulness, no control over the use of cigarettes and alcohol, and delusions.

The most recent study on the prevalence of mental health problems was conducted by the National Epidemiology Center (DOH-NEC) in 2006 which showed revealing results though the target population was limited only to government: employees from the 20 national agencies in Metro Manila. Among 327 respondents, 32 percent were found to have experienced a mental health problem at least once in their lifetime. The three most prevalent diagnoses were: speciﬁc phobias (15 %), alcohol abuse (10%), and depression (6%). Males were most likely to have substance-related problems than females. Mental health problems were signiﬁcantly associated
with the following respondent characteristics: ages 20-29 years, those who have big families, and those who had low educational attainment. The prevalence rate generated from the survey was much higher than those that were previously reported by 17 percent.

To address these concerns, several policies were made to deal with mental health and mental disorders in the country. One major policy was RA 9165, known as the Comprehensive Dangerous Drug Act which was promulgated as a measure to prevent problems in drug abuse which is recognized as both a direct and an indirect cause of mental illness among the economically productive age group. In 2001, the DOH formulated the National Mental Health Policy (Administrative Order No. 8 s. 2001), which prescribed the national policy framework towards the attainment of a good state of mental health for all Filipinos. The mental health strategy aims to improve mental health and integrate services for people with mental disorders. Implementation shall be guided by the succeeding policy statements, i.e., leadership, collaboration and partnership, empowerment and participation, equity, standards for quality mental health services, human resource development, health service delivery system, mental health care, stability and sustainability, information system, legislation and monitoring and evaluation.

The mental health policy was reafﬁrmed in the National Objectives for Health, which outlined the goals, and objectives to be achieved by the health sector by 2010. It also speciﬁed strategies for national reform from an institutionally based mental health system to one that is consumer focused with an emphasis on supporting the individual in their community.

In order to facilitate the overall implementation of these goals, priority targets and strategies aligned to health systems goals of improving the health status in the country, this Order is hereby established to provide policy guidelines and procedures for establishing mental health program at the national and local levels.
