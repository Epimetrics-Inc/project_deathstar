I. RATIONALE 

Under Republic Act (RA) No. 7581 or the “Price Act” of 1992, the Department of Health (DOH) is identiﬁed as the lead implementing agency in classifying essential drugs as “basic necessities” and monitoring their corresponding prices to ensure that they are reasonable at all times. 

In support to the abovementioned law, the DOH issued Administrative Order (A0) No. 2006—0009 dated February 14, 2006, establishing the guidelines institutionalizing and strengthening the Essential Drug Price Monitoring System ( e~EDPMS) in the DOH.

Subsequently, Administrative Order (A0) No. 2008-01 was jointly formulated by the Department of Health , Department of Trade and Industry, Intellectual Property Office, and Bureau of Food and Drugs (now known as Food and Drugs Administration), which set the Implementing Rules and Regulations ([RR) of RA No. 9502.
