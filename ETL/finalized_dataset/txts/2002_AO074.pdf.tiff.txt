<subject>SUBJECT: Guidelines on the Utilization of DOH Central Ofﬁce CY 2001 Procured Dental Supplies and Medicines for the Comprehensive Dental Health Program</subject>


<body>

These guidelines are issued as a reference for the allocation, distribution and utilization of dental supplies and medicines procured by the DOH Central Ofﬁce during the CY 2001 for the comprehensive dental health program.

Oral diseases are predominant and very alarming among Filipinos.

These oral diseases produce considerable impact on the quality of life of individuals. Studies revealed that oral diseases could cause ﬁinctional limitations on the performance of an individual. Aside from the physical pain and psychological discomfort, these diseases affect eating habits, social interactions, self-esteem and productivity at work and in school.

To promote and protect the health and well being of the family — particularly the children, women and older persons, a comprehensive dental health program is being implemented nationwide. In line with this program, this Department is carrying out an augmentation of logistics as support to ﬁeld health services under LGUS in terms of dental supplies and medicines. This is to ensure that indigent sectors of our society shall be provided with quality and affordable dental health care. In the implementation of dental health program, the most critical issue is the preper management of logistics, hence, the formulation of this guideline.
