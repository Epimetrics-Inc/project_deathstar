<subject>SUBJECT: Revised Policies and Guidelines for the Implementation of the Partnership for Alternative Health Sciences Education (PAHSE) Program to be known as the Innovative Health Sciences Education Premiership (IHSEP) Program.</subject>

<body>

I. Statement of Health Human Resource (HHR) Production Policy

Pursuant to R.A. 7305 otherwise known as the Magma Carta for Public Health Workers, R.A. 7383 known as Barangay Health Workers’ Benefits and Incentives Act, the Health Commission Report and the Policies on Health Human Resource Development of the Department, the Partnership for Alternative Health Sciences Education (PAHSE) Program was conceptualized in 1994 as a long—term strategy to respond to the problem of inequitable health human resource distribution in the country.

To ensure that health sciences education in the Philippines is responsive to the health needs of the communities, consistent with the actual roles of health workers in the health system and that quality-assured health services are equitably distributed, the Department of Health encourages and supports the establishment  of health sciences education programs with innovative, community-based and problem-based curriculum located in strategic areas of the country. Likewise, it shall support the installation of changes and reformation in the curricula, methodologies, books and textbooks of existing conventional schools consistent  with HHR production policies. 

The Premiership for Alternative Health Sciences Education (PAHSE) Program was implemented since 1994. For the Step-ladder component, it was  participated in by universities/medical schools all over the country and were   able to produce first and second batches of graduates from level 1 to 2. However, a National Consultative Workshop was convened last February 12-14, 1997 for an implementation review and likewise discuss policy issues and concerns  encountered during the last 2 years. To ensure that this innovative curriculum is not viewed inferior from various conventional health professional courses, the word “alternative“ in the program title was recommended to he changed to “innovative” . Since the word “alternative” connotes “second rate/grade", a “stop-gap measure”, a “substitute” which can not be levelled off to what is
considered to be the standard, the group agreed to change it to “innovative”. The word “innovative” denotes « a wider perspective and can compete with conventional health professional courses. 


II. HHR Production Principles

In line with the DOH-HHR policies, the following principles shall guide HHR production:

1. Education and Training in the Health Sciences Programs shall: 

a. develop competencies in the students and trainees that are required by their roles 111 the health system;
b. be in settings that are as similar as possible to the place of practice. and the culture being served;
c. be in the context of the national and regional health priorities, disease problems and socio-economic millieu; 
d. promote the development of skills in problem solving;
e. promote the desired skills and opportunity for continuing learning;
f. promote team spirit;
g. promote value formation (e.g. nationalism commitment, concern for people, service-orientation, gender sensitivity, culture sensitivity recognition of other health care providers and support groups as equal partners);
h. emphasise comprehensive community health development concept; Primary Health Care principles and approaches; Minimum Basic Needs; health system under the LGC of 1991; and, women’s concerns; and,
i. recognize and acknowledge Indigenous or Traditional and  Alternative or Complementary Health Care. 
2. The teacher/trainer shall be competent not only in the discipline as health care giver but also as an educator.
3. Student/trainee admission to health sciences schools shall be based on both intellectual and non—cognitive (psychosocial) criteria.
4. Student/trainee admission to health sciences schools shall be based on the need of the community/facility and support to be given by the beneficiaries.
5. Evaluation of student shall measure the development of critical thinking; cognitive and psychomotor skills as well as proper attitude and values rather than mastery of facts.


III. Program Goal

Production and development of health human resources responsive to the country’s health needs and consistent with their roles in the health system.


IV. Program Obiectives 

General: To support reforms and innovations in the undergraduate; graduate and post-graduate health sciences education in response to the country’s health needs.

Specific:

1. To encourage and support the institutions in the establishment of programs with an innovative curriculum (as defined in Section VII No. 2 and Section VIII No. 2) in strategic areas of the country.
2. To assist health sciences institutions in developing a community-based, problem-based and competency-based curricula espousing Primary Health Care (PHC) approaches; Minimum Basic Needs; women’s concerns; gender sensitivity; and, Indigenous/Traditional and Alternative/ Complementary health care.
3. To support the development of health sciences educators/trainers and other resources in competency-based, problem-based, and community-directed learning.
4. To establish mechanisms in the health sciences education system that will effectively and efficiently facilitate the operation of the IHSEPP and that will equitably distribute appropriate health professionals in the country.


V. Program Strategies

A. Step-Ladder Curriculum

Step-ladder Education involves operationalization of a counter culture in health human resource development. This includes:

a. a highly democratized and rational admission procedures that  delegates most responsibilities tor students recruitment to communities and LGUs; 
b. an innovative curriculum that offers a sequential aid integrated approach to health human resource education Which 1s problem—based competency-based, and community-directed allowing lateral entry;
c. an educational principle that emphasizes service-commitment, value re—orientation and community relevance over academic
excellence, and,
d. deployment assurance, acceptance and support by the communities and Local Government Units (LGUs) where the graduates will serve.

B. Graduate and Post-Graduate degree programs on community Medicine, community Health, Primary Health Care Management and the Social Sciences.

These are innovative approaches and curricular reorientation in graduate and post-graduate courses for purposes of continuing education; professionalizing the bureaucracy; and, providing opportunities for various career paths for health personnel. Likewise, this strategy is aimed at strengthening management of health service through such graduate and post-graduate educational programs. 

C. Community Health Development Experiences

In collaboration with the academe and other agencies involved in health sciences education, the local government units and the community, selected communities will be developed where the students of health sciences schools are accommodated. Co-curricular activities and exposure/study tour to the different models of Primary Health Care communities guarantee teaching-learning interactions between students, community leaders and residents regarding community health development and health program operations.
