<subject>SUBJECT: The Department of Health's "Partnership for Alternative Health Sciences Education” (PAHSE) program to facilitate and encourage Alternative Health Sciences Education programs in the country.</subject>



<body>




I. Statement of Health Human Resource Development (HHRD) Production Policy


To ensure that health sciences education in the Philippines is responsive to the health needs of the communities, consistent with the actual roles of health workers in the health system and that health services are equitably distributed in the country, the Department of Health encourages and supports the establishment of Health Sciences Education Programs with innovative, community-based and problem based curriculum in strategic areas of the country. Likewise, it shall support the installation of changes in the curricula of existing conventional schools consistent with HHRD policies.




II. HHRD-Production Principles

In line with the Don HHRD policies, the following principles shall guide HHR production: 

1. Education and Training in Health Sciences Programs shall:

a. develop competencies in the students that are required by their roles in the health system;
b. be in settings that are as similar as possible to the place of practice;
c. be in the context of the national and regional health priorities, disease problems and socio-economic milleu; 
d. promote the development of skills in problem solving; 
e. promote the desire, skills and opportunity for continuing learning; 
f. promote team spirit;
g. promote value formation (e.g. nationalism, commitment, concern for people, service-orientation, gender—sensitivity, culture sensitivity, recognition of other health care providers as equal partners);
h. emphasize community health and development; and
i. recognize and acknowledge indigenous healing traditions

2. The teacher/trainee shall he competent not only in the discipline as health care giver but also as an educator.

3. Student admission to health sciences schools shall be based on both intellectual and non-cognitive (psychosocial) criteria

4. Evaluation of students shall measure the development of critical thinking, cognitive and psychomotor skills as well as proper attitude rather than mastery of facts.

To respond to the HHRD production policy and principles stated above, the Department of Health is implementing the “Partnership for AHSE“ Program to facilitate and encourage innovative health sciences education programs in the country.




III. Program Goal 

Production and development of health human resources responsive to the country’s health needs and consistent with their roles in the health system. 




IV. Program Objectives 

General:

To support reforms in the undergraduate and graduate health sciences education in response to the country’s health needs.

Specific:

1. To encourage and support the establishment programs with an innovative curriculum (as defined in Section VIII A No. 2) in strategic areas of the country. 

2. To assist health sciences institutions in developing a community based and problem based curricula espousing Primary Health Care (PHC) approaches.

3. To support the development of health sciences educators and other resources in problem based learning. 

4. To establish mechanism in the health sciences education system that will equitably distribute health professionals in the country.




V. Program Strategies


A. Stepladder Education

Stepladder Education involves operationalization of a counter culture in health human resource development. This includes:

a highly democratized admission procedure that delegates most responsibilities for student recruitment to communities and LGUs;

an innovative curriculum that offers a sequential and integrated approach to health human resource education;

an educational principle that emphasizes service commitment, value reorientation and community relevance over academic excellence and;

development assurance, acceptance and support by the communities and Local Government Units (LGUs) where the graduates will serve.


B. Graduate degree programs on Community Medicine, Community Health, Primary Health Care Management and the Social Sciences.

Innovative approaches and curricular reorientation in graduate courses for purposes of continuing education and providing opportunities for various career paths for health  personnel. Likewise, this sTrategy is aimed at Strengthening management of health services through such graduate educational programs.


C. Community Health Development Experiences

In collaboration with the academe and other agencies involved in health sciences education, the local government units and the community, selected communities will be developed where the students of health sciences schools are accommodated. Co-curricular activities guarantee teaching-learning interactions between students, community leaders and residents regarding community health development and health program operations.




VI. Program Management

1. Organizational Structure

VIII. General Guidelines


A. Initial Screening of Proposals:

All new proposals shall be initially evaluated in accordance with the following criteria:

1. Situational Analysis

The HHR situation in the catchment area of the educational institution will be analyzed according to:

1.1. the HHR population ratio
1.2. presence and number of educational institutions offering health science programs
1.3. national impact of the program to be funded

2. Compliance with the technical definition of an alternative health science education.

2.1. An innovative curriculum that is defined as:

2.1.1. multi-track or with multiple exit
2.1.2. interfaces service with training
2.1.3. having a stepladder continuum
2.1.4. integrates career pathways
2.1.5. is flexible and adjustable to the regional and local requirement

2.2 Compliance with the HHRD production principles stated in Section II of this document.

3. Feasibility of the proposal according to:

3.1. human resource capability of the institution

3.1.1. faculty available specifically for the program and with capability for innovative education. 
3.1.2. other support personnel to help administer the program.

3.2. track record of the educational institution in terms of stability implementing innovations in education and

3.3. physical facilities available for the program

3.3.1. interaction rooms for innovative teaching 
3.3.2. indigenous and local materials and books should be a distinctive part of the library

3.4. for purposes of sustainability, the institution’s capability of incorporating the program to its existing and future budgets

3.5. placement of graduates

4. Recruitment of Students

Students shall be recruited with the following minimum criteria:

a. non-cognitive criteria:

* should come from an underserved, remote and economically depressed community
* should be nominated by his/her community the proof of which would be a signed petition or resolution containing the signature of the mayor, a recognized community leader such as the barangay captain and at least 55% of household heads as signatories. This would serve as the social contract between the student and acceptance by the community of the student as a health worker upon completion of the study grant.
* should be willing to serve his/her community upon completion of the study grant for a period of time based on the social contract.
* should come from the lower percentile income bracket
* should have financial support from the communities and/or the LGUs

b. cognitive criteria

should be intellectually capable as determined by results of procedures devised by the educational institutions (proponents)

A multi-agency committee for student recruitment shall be created at the regional level to be composed of representatives from the educational institution, DECS, DILG, DOH, DSWD and other concerned NGOs. Actual field validation shall be conducted by members of this committee for prospective students.

In addition, specific criteria appropriate to established concerns may be adopted by the Screening Committee in evaluating a proposal.


B. Curriculum Review

The curriculum should have the following core characteristics:

1. Its educational goals should be relevant and consistent with the needs of the community where the future graduate will serve.

2. The curriculum, while encouraging variations, contrasts and other forms of innovations, must retain academic rigour and adhere to the accepted minimum standards of performance for the level of health worker. Such standards of professional performance must be defined and adopted.

3. It should be a community based and problem based curriculum that subsumed PHC philosophy. At least fifty percent (50%) of the curricular time must be spent continuously in a community that is similar to the future area of service. The spirit of self-direction, self-reliance and eventually, self-sufficiency through the participatory processes must permeate not only the learning and teaching transactions but also the interactions with the community.

4. The curriculum must be competency-based and role-based, the role as defined by the health needs and problems of the local/regional health system. The program of studies must identify the role/s of the future graduate of the course in the local/regional health system. Based on this role, the terminal competencies, whether intellectual, attitudinal or psychomotor skills, that the students will be capable of performing.

5. The design of the academic program must be developmental in character, which allows the acquisition of knowledge, attitude and skills in a graduated level by level progression that takes in consideration the student’s readiness, intellectual, social, emotional and psychological characteristics and even financial capability;

6. The organization of the courses must be step-ladder in progression and should integrate a career-pathway from the basic course all the way to a masteral or a doctorate considering, in particular, the students and the service areas’ time constraints.

7. Service leaves must be a requirement after each program level study. The minimum duration for service leaves is three months depending on other objectives of such leaves besides that of the ultimate goal of fostering value commitment to serve through the process of psychoemotional bonding with the people and the community. Service leaders must also be well planned, supervised, and evaluated just like other academic subjects.

8. The curriculum and the program of studies must be flexible and adjustable to the local/regional requirements. Since the final objective of PAHSE is to develop the health human resources of the local/regional health system, the needs of these areas to be served must define the core knowledge to be learned and form the basis for the competencies to be acquired.

9. To be included in the PAHSE, the curriculum must demonstrate a significant shift from existing educational programs in health. Essentially, it should fulfill the goal of developing the appropriate health human resources who will work in the health system of the country.

10. The basic educational program must include humanities and social sciences and should emphasize an integrated approach.


C. Program of Studies

An AHSE course must have a program of study that possesses the following attributes:

1. The program of study must provide opportunities for the acquisition and practice of the basic values of respect for all forms of life, concern for people and environment, service to others, gender sensitivity, acceptance and respect for cultural differences and the integration of this into the broader value of commitment to nationalism and its promotion.

2. The concept of the health team as an effective approach to national health development, team spirit, skills needed in teamwork, and good work ethics must be the heart of the academic program.

3. Curricular content should reflect the local and regional health needs. Health problems that cut across geographic boundaries and are influenced by population movement and optional health priorities identified in the national health plan must also be considered. However, this should not take priority over local ones.

4. Courses that develop the student’s understanding of people, their individual nature (self) and their social and collective expressions through speech (linguistics), habits and lifestyles (sociology, anthropology), individual and group behaviors (psychology, politics, history), and values (art forms) should form the foundation of the study of health and illness.

5. Innovative methods of teaching must distinguish an AHSE program. Teaching methods that are innovative, participatory, and student-centered must be heavily utilized. Participatory activities must be used whenever possible. This also necessitates that classes be kept small in size. Specifically, there should be no more than 25 students per teaching session.

6. The curricular program must emphasize less the mastery of facts and information but more the application of these in the formulation of possible solutions to prevailing health problems. Lectures will be lessened; rather, student’s self-reliance will be encouraged. The use of creative activities such as theater and other art forms as venues for sharing concepts, ideas, and learnings and teaching will be encouraged. At least fifty percent (50%) of the learning and teaching activities must be undertaken, for appropriateness, “unreadable text” setting that approximates the conditions of the place of the future service.

7. The academic program must develop the students’ skills in communication, community organizing, social mobilization and advocacy. In addition, appropriate skills in working effectively within the local government system must also be developed.

8. The academic courses should culminate into the acquisition of macro perspectives such as national health development and an effective and efficient health resource management to attain health for all Filipinos.

9. Finally, opportunities for continuing professional education of the graduates must form an integral part of the program of studies.


D. Faculty Development

Each school must have a short term and long term development plan. The faculty training program should not only concentrate in developing subject matter expertise but more importantly; expertise in the techniques and the practice of modern principles of adult learning. The setting and method used must also adhere to the tenets of the AHSE.


E. institutional Development

1. Any educational institution that wishes to participate in this program must show some plans to undertake an institutional, development process promulgating AHSE principles.

2. If the institution already has conventional courses in midwifery, nursing or medicine, efforts should first be directed towards reforming their curriculum and incorporating them into the program. Only if this is not possible can a parallel program be supported instead.


F. Consortiums

Consortiums among universities/colleges within the Region should be encouraged if there is a lack of capability of one institution to implement all levels of the stepladder program.


G. Monitoring

Programs being supported by the DOH under the program shall be monitored at least twice during its course for courses whose duration is less than a year or twice per calendar year for courses whose duration is more than a year. Monitoring teams shall be composed of a member from each TWG and the Council. Areas to be monitored are the following:

* curriculum and program of study
* faculty development
* performance of students in schools
* community work of the students
* LGU and community responses to the students on service leaves
* deployment of graduates
