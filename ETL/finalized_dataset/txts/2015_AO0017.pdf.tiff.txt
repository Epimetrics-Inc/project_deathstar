I. RATIONALE 

By virtue of Executive Order No. 102 s. 1999, the Department of Health was mandated to be the “lead agency in ensuring equity, access and quality of health care services through policy formulation, standards development and regulations” and to “formulate national policies and standards for health ”. 

In the same manner, by virtue of Republic Act No. 4226 “An Act Requiring the Licensure of all Hospitals in the Philippines and Authorizing the Bureau of Medical Services to serve as the Licensing Agency”, the Department of Health through its licensing bureau was ‘ mandated “to keep a permanent register of approved hospitals or those issued licenses to operate indicating the name of the hospital, address or location, type of hospital, name of the director or administrator, ownership, number of authorized beds and bassinets and such other pertinent data as may be necessary.’ In July 18, 2012, Administrative Order No. 2012-0012 “Rules and Regulations Governing the New Classiﬁcation of Hospitals and Other Health Facilities in the Philippines” has required all hospitals and other health facilities to have a non-medical support unit which includes an Information Management Unit. The hospital information management unit is responsible for collection and aggregation of relevant data for the timely and efﬁcient delivery of health services. Further, pursuant to AO 2012-0012, all hospitals and health facilities shall submit data/information as may be required by DOH through the Health Facilities and Services Regulatory Bureau (HFSRB) for purposes of research, standards, setting, improving access to quality health services and others. 

Therefore, in fulﬁlment of these mandates, the Health Human Resource Development Bureau shall utilize the National Database of Selected Human Resources for Health Information System (NDHRHIS), a web-based system to facilitate the collection of data on human resources for health - (HRH) from hospitals and other health facilities. The NDHRHIS data are aggregated to produce statistical reports that can be used for HRH planning and management, policy development and research. In addition, such data is needed to determine the location, distribution and skill mix of HRH to be deployed to complement existing HRH at all levels of the health care system. 

This Administrative Order aims to strengthen the NDHRHIS Data Collection System and establish a more accurate and reliable database of HRH as a tool for planners and managers to support the achievement of Universal Health Care. 

II. OBJECTIVES

Speciﬁc: 

1. To establish a mechanism of HRH data collection from hospitals and other health facilities;
