I. BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE 

The Philippines is a low middle income country spending 3.84% of its Gross Domestic Product (GDP) on health care with 53% of health expenditures paid out of pocket (Philippine National Health Accounts, 2011). Pharmaceuticals represent the largest single item of health care expenditures currently at about 42% of family expenditures for medical care (FIES, 2009). Medicines are also one of the largest cost components of government expenditures in terms ‘of payments made through the National Health Insurance Program (N HIP). 

The alarming high out-of—pocket (OOP) payments cause a signiﬁcant burden to the poor who comprise approximately a third of the population. Several factors account for the high OOP payments for medicines, central to which is the lack of regular and sustained access to essential medicines in the public sector (WHO 2009 Household Survey on Medicines). The continued high prices of some of the essential medicines, contribute to the inaccessibility of essential medicines, since the poor does not have the ability to pay for them. 

The 1987 Philippine Constitution upholds the right of every Filipino to health, and adopts an integrated and comprehensive health development approach to make affordable essential goods and health services accessible to all (Article XII Section 15). Equitable access to essential medicines is recognized as a critical component of the national health and socioeconomic agenda. As such, the government approved/enacted several policies and laws including Republic Act 592.? of 1969 entitled “An Act Regulating the Practice of Pharmacy and Setting Standards of Pharmaceutical Education in the Philippines and for other Purposes”, Republic Act No. 3720, series of 1963, as amended by Executive Order 175, series of 1987, otherwise known as the “Food, Drugs and Devices, and Cosmetics Act”, and subsequently Republic Act No. 9711 otherwise known as “The Food and Drug Administration Act of 2009”. The Philippine Administration in 1988, likewise made a pronouncement on a Philippine National Drug Policy (PNDP) with ﬁve pillars namely, People empowerment, Quality Assurance, Rational Use of Drugs, Self-Reliance, and Tailored Procurement. This was used as a guide for the government to provide access to quality, affordable medicines to the majority of the Philippine populace. 


 Other pertinent legislations include the Generics Act of 1988, and Executive Order No. 49 of 1993 mandating all government agencies to adhere to the Philippine National Drug Formulary as the basis for drug procurement and social health insurance reimbursement. Further, measures adopted to improve access to medicines were articulated in the Medium Term Philippine Development Plan (MTPDP) 2001- 2004/2004-2010. The “Universally Accessible and Affordable Quality Medicines Act of 2008” (Republic Act 9502) and the Food and Drug Administration Act of 2009 (Republic Act 921]) further enhanced government initiatives to ensure wider access to quality and safe essential medicines for all Filipino. To support the implementation of RA 9502, the Department of Health — National Center for Pharmaceutical Access and management (DOH—NCPAM) was established in 2010 through Administrative Order No. 2010- 0005. 

The current administration, through the Kalusugan Pangkalahatan (KP) Strategy as reﬂected in the Philippine Development Plan 2011—2016 commits to pursue the goal of greater access to medicines to achieve optimal health outcomes for all Filipinos. 

The Philippine -Medicines Strategy (PMS) 2011-2016 which was approved in 2011 shall serve as the country road map towards universal access to affordable, quality, essential medicines for all Filipinos. It reﬂects among others the major strategies and activities that will be undertaken for the medium term as well as the roles and responsibilities of the key stakeholders including national government agencies, local government units, the industry, health providers, the academe, patients and civil society, with the DOH—National Center for Pharmaceutical Access and Management taking the lead in implementing, monitoring and evaluating the same. 

The pillars of the Philippine Medicines Policy as enumerated below articulates the values which all stakeholders must pursue and adopt in a transparent, participative and harmonious manner to achieve the health systems goals, cognizant of the importance of continuous innovation and the advancement and growth of the pharmaceutical industry with the end in view of universal access to medicines:

B. Affordability and availability. This pillar consists of the full range of mechanisms which government shall employ for all Filipinos to have adequate and timely access to medicines at all levels of the health service delivery chain. This shall include emphasis on promoting effective competition that will result in the transparent and rational pricing of medicines.

D. Accountability, Transparency and Good Governance.
