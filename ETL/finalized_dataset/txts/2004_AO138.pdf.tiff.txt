<subject>SUBJECT: Guidelines for the Implementation of the Simplified Supplier Redistration System (SSRS)</subject>


<body>

A. RATIONALE

One major principle spelled out in Sec. 3 of Republic Act No. 9184 (RA 9184), otherwise known as the Government Procurement Reform Act, is that of competitiveness, which aims to provide fair and equal access to all prospective bidders (sic). Numerous initiatives have been undertaken to advocate a shift from the widely practiced, but limiting, process of accreditation and pro—qualification to the use of eligibility as a means for establishing a bidder’s qualification to participate in government biddings.

The concept of eligibility rests primarily on a bidder’s submission of a standard checklist of documentary requirements, which are examined bythe Bids and Awards Committee (BAC) as to their completeness and correctness, exercising minimal discretion in the process.

Since a number of these documents remain valid for a particular calendar year, RA 9184 prescribes the setting up of a Supplier Registration System aimed at facilitating the government procurement process.

B. SCOPE

Provisions contained in this Administrative Order (AO) shall apply to all procurement, whether locally or foreign-funded, conducted within and by the Department of Health, including all Centers for Health Development, Special/Specialty Hospitals, Retained Hospitals and Medical Centers and Attached Agencies.

C. DETAILED GUIDELINES

1. In line with Administrative Order No. 130 S. 2004, dated January 5, 2004, Abolition of Existing Procurement-related Accreditation Committees, submission of an Accreditation Certificate shall not be a requisite for participation in bidding; however, bidders holding valid certificates may submit these in place of the standard eligibility requirements during bid openings.

2. Biddings shall henceforth be open for participation to all interested parties, provided they complete the eligibility requirements spelled out in the terms and conditions of a particular bidding.

3. To promote expediency in the bid opening and evaluation process, on the part of both the DOH and prospective bidders, the latter are enjoined to apply for registration in the Simplified Supplier Registration System (SSRS) to be implemented throughout the entire DOH.

4. Companies interested can apply for registration in the SSRS as follows:

a. Secure the pro-numbered SSRS Application Form (Annex A)

b. Return the accomplished form to the appropriate BAC Secretariat and submit the appropriate documents, depending on the type of contract, whether Goods, Civil Works or Consultancy Services, that the company intends to bid for, as listed in the SSRS Application Form.

c. Pay a nominal registration fee of to Five Hundred Fifty Pesos (P 550.00), for which an Official Receipt shall be issued

d. Approval of the application for registration shall be contingent on the completeness and correctness of the documents submitted.

e. Upon approval of a supplier’s application of registration, the BAC Secretariat shall prepare an SSRS Certificate, which shall clearly indicate the documents submitted and shall be signed by the BAC Chairperson. (Annex B)

f. The SSRS Certificate may be claimed from the BAC Secretariat after five (5) calendar days.

g. Applications for registration with the SSRS shall be accepted throughout the year; however, SSRS Certificates shall be valid only for the calendar year in which it was issued.

h. Registration must be done annually and shall be considered automatic, upon payment of a renewal fee of Four Hundred Seventy Five Pesos (P 475.00). However, suppliers shall be responsible for updating their respective records. Failure to do so, when required, shall warrant appropriate legal sanctions, pursuant to RA 9184.

i. An updated list of all registered suppliers shall be maintained on the DOH Intranet and Internet WebPages. For this purpose, the BAC Secretariat of all Centers for Health Development, Special/Specialty Hospitals, Retained Hospitals and Medical Centers and Attached Agencies are directed to submit a list of suppliers that have registered with them on a monthly basis, using the enclosed form (Annex C)

h. For purposes of public bidding/local shopping, a registered supplier may secure a Certified True Copy (CTC) of their SSRS Certificate from the BAC Secretariat at a cost of Eighty Pesos (P 80.00) and submit this in lieu of the documents indicated, should these be required for eligibility.

D. EFFECTIVITY

This Order shall take effect fifteen (15) days after its publication in two (2) newspapers of general circulation.
