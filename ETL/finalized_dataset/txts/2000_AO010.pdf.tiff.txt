<subject>SUBJECT: Guidelines on the Department of Health Accreditation for Drug Suppliers.</subject>

<body>

I. INTRODUCTION

The accreditation of suppliers is an essential screening mechanism to ensure that only qualified bidders can transact business with the Department of Health. Based on the procurement experiences at various organizational levels and on the monitoring/ evaluation of the modiﬁed procurement system, the accreditation process has to be strengthened so it could really serve as a gatekeeper of the whole system. This will also ensure that the DOH deals with suppliers who perform to the best interest of the DOH in particular and the Filipino people in general.

The shift of the procurement of drugs from the central office to the Regional Health Office calls for the accreditation of qualified drug suppliers who are able to supply safe, efficacious and good quality drugs.

Administrative Order No. 27 set the Guidelines and Procedures on Accreditation in government Suppliers for Pharmaceutical Products in 1998. However, the ensuing results of monitoring/evaluation warranted the review and amendment to some policy statements in order to address major issues and concerns regarding the quality of drug.
