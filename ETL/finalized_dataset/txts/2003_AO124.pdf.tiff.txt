<body>
I. RATIONALE

The Department of Health (DOH) recognizes the vital role of its health human resources and prioritizes them as an important organizational investment. The rational and balanced development of our health human resources is necessary to ensure the efficient and effective delivery of health services to the Filipino people.

Opportunities for travel, including fellowship and scholarship grants, both at the local and international levels, redound to the professional growth and capability building of every employee. To ensure maximum benefit to be derived by the DOH employees as well as by their respective offices from these opportunities, guidelines on foreign fellowships, scholarships and training are hereby institutionalized.

II. DEFINITION OF TERMS

1. Fellowship - an award for advanced study abroad, given to individuals on the recommendation of their government/institution to fit them for a specific assignment; thus, assisting in the development of the health programme in their country.

A. Long-Term Fellowship - a training course in pursuit of a formal degree (e.g. masteral, doctoral)
B. Short-Term Fellowship - a special training course, short-term duration which may be in the following forms:

a. Study Tour, exposure/orientation program - this is sometimes referred to as "traveling seminar," a visit by a group of health workers or scientists to one or several countries to study local problems and methods of dealing with them. It is, thus, both a fact-finding mission and an educational experience.

b. Seminar - a meeting at which participants familiarize themselves with the state of knowledge in a particular field with the assistance of an expert discussion leader.

c. Workshop - an educational device intended mainly for those already employed in a particular field. The emphasis is on a free discussion, exchange of ideas, demonstration of methods and practical application of skills and principles.

d. Symposium - a meeting of specialists representing different disciplines to exchange ideas and experience. It is essentially an exploratory meeting designed to discover what contribution different disciplines can make to the solution of a specific problem or set of problems.

e. Conference/Congress - usually larger than a symposium and is concerned more with broad strategic approaches to problems than with their scientific or technical aspects. The participants in a conference may be designated as government representatives.

2. Scholarship - maintenance or stipend for a student awarded by an educational institution.
