<subject>SUBJECT: Implementing Guidelines On Hepatitis B Immunization For Infants</subject>


<body>

I. RATIONALE

Hepatitis B is a major public health problem in the Philippines with an estimated seven million people (approximately 10-12% of the total population) chronically infected with the virus. Twenty to 30% of these chronically infected people will develop chronic liver disease (cirrhosis of liver, liver cancer, etc) mostly between 30—50 years of age. Many will die from it as there is no effective and affordable drug treatment currently available for hepatitis B. Approximately 9000 people are estimated to die from chronic liver disease in Philippines annually—a mortality rate comparable to that of tuberculosis. Majority of chronic carriers of infection acquire their infection either at birth (when the risk of becoming a chronic carrier is almost 90%) or in the early childhood by exposure to serous/blood eXudates from cuts/wounds/bites of other infected children (the risk of becoming chronic carrier is almost 30% if exposed between age 1 and 5 years, though gets reduced to 10% if infected after ﬁve years of age).

Based on current evidence, universal childhood immunization with three doses of hepatitis B vaccine including a birth dose - available since early 19803 - will enable the Philippines to reduce Hepatitis B prevalence from its current 10-12% to below 1%. For example, Taiwan saw a reduction from 20.3 percent to 4.4 percent in males and 14.3 percent to 2.4 percent in females born more than 6 years before the start of the national vaccination program (1991 — 2001 Evaluation). From a later study in 2003, it further decreased to 0.7 percent. Hepatitis B vaccine is also effective in preventing infection, if given immediately after exposure to infection (post-exposure prophylaxis). Hence, in settings such as the Philippines where almost 10% of mothers may be chronic carriers of the virus, and at risk of transmitting the infection to their newborns at the time of birth (due to exposure of newborn to infected blood from mother), it is recommended to give the ﬁrst dose of vaccine within 24 hours of birth to prevent mother to child transmission of infection. The baby of HBsAg and HBeAg positive mother has a 70-90% risk of infection. Immunization reduces the risk by 70-95% of the ﬁrst dose is given soon after birth. In the absence of a birth dose, despite sustained high coverage with three doses of vaccine (e. g. when the immunization schedule starts at 6 wks rather than at birth), an estimated 3-5% of all infant will develop chronic liver infection as a result of mother to child transmission at birth resulting in overall poor hepatitis B control.

Hepatitis B vaccine has been introduced and available in the national EPI program since 1992, targeting 40% of the infants, with the aim of increasing coverage by an additional 10% of the population each year to reach 100% coverage by 1999 (Department Circular No. 242s.1990, “Implementing Guidelines on the Integration of Hepatitis B into the Expanded Program, on Immunization ” dated December 10, 1990). However, insufﬁcient allocation of fund to EPI limits the full implementation Of the Hepatitis B vaccination as planned earlier.

In addition, the hepatitis B vaccination schedule introduced in 1992 included ﬁrst dose at 6 weeks of age rather than at birth and hence was not effective in preventing transmission of infection from infected mother to newborns.

Pursuant to Republic Act No. 7846 otherwise known as the Compulsory Hepatitis B immunization among infants and children less than 8 years old, Hepatitis B vaccination shall be routinely strengthened with the activities and plans of the Expanded Program on Immunization (EPI) to effectively control hepatitis B in the country by reducing the chronic infection rate of hepatitis B to less than 1% among future birth cohorts from the current levels of 10-12%. A legislative bill is currently being pushed entitled, “Basic Immunization Services for Infants”,.to address this concern. This is envisioned to provide the administration of ﬁrst dose of Hepatitis B vaccine as soon as possible after birth within 24 hours of birth to prevent mother to child (perinatal) transmission. Perinatal transmission is known to be a major source for maintaining a pool of chronic infection carriers who are at risk of developing long term complications of infection in their economically productive years, besides serving as source of infection for others. In support of this, Republic Act No. 2029 otherwise known as the “Liver Cancer and Hepatitis B Awareness Month Act” which declares the month of February as the liver cancer and hepatitis B awareness month throughout the Philippines was also passed.

To ensure an effective and efﬁcient management of routine hepatitis B vaccination program for infants in all types of facilities including the hospitals, this guideline is hereby prescribed and established. Consultations with the EPI regional nurse and medical coordinators nationwide, WHO, UNICEF and presentations to the National Immunization Committee (NIC), an interagency advisory body of EPI was sought to ensure successful operations of Hepatitis B vaccination among infants.

II. SCOPE AND COVERAGE

This order shall apply to all DOH health facilities at all levels of health care including all public and private health facilities and other institutions providing immunization services for children nationwide.

III. PROGRAM GOAL

To reduce the chronic hepatitis B infection rate as measured by HBsAg prevalence to less than 1% among ﬁve—year-old children born after routine Hepatitis B vaccination at birth started.

IV. OBJECTIVES

A. General

To improve effectiveness of management in the provision of three (3) doses of routine Hepatitis B vaccine among infants including a birth dose.

B. Specific

a. To provide new guidelines and procedures for Hepatitis B vaccination for infants at all types of health facilities,
b. To provide instructions for administration of birth dose Hepatitis B vaccine according to the settings where the birth takes place.

V. DEFINITION OF TERMS

Perinatal transmission - refers to transmission from mother to child at the time of birth.

Seroprevalence — refers to percentage of a polulation whose sera are positive for a speciﬁc marker such as an antibody (e.g. anti—HBs or anti-HBc) or an antigen (e. g. HBsAg or HBeAg)

HBs Ag - refers to Hepatitis B surface antigen. A protein from the virus’ s coat. Its presence in the blood indicates current infection (acute or Chronic). The immune response to the HBsAg provides the basis for immunity against Hepatitis B virus.

HbeAg - refers to Hepatitis B “e ” antigen, the presence of which implies active viral replication, thus making it a marker of greater infectivity in chronic infection.

Monovalent vaccine - refers to a vaccine containing antigen for protection against a single disease

VI. GENERAL GUIDELINES

1. DOH shall procure 75% of the hepatitis B vaccine needs for 2007 and 100% starting 2008 and onwards to provide all 0~11 months olds with three doses of hepatitis B vaccine in the ﬁrst year of life free of charge in all health facilities and other institutions providing immunization services for children nationwide.

2. All newborns infants shall be given immunization against hepatitis B immediately Within 24 hours after birth.

3. Infants born outside of hospital, medical clinic or birthing facilities should be brought to any available healthcare facility so as to be immunized against Hepatitis B within 24 hours after birth but not later than 7 days.

4. The subsequent doses of Hepatitis B vaccination shall be completed according to the new recommended schedule of Hepatitis B immunization.

5. All health care practitioners or health care workers providing prenatal care shall educate all pregnant mothers on the importance of giving their infants the basic immunization services.

6. Every child shall be immunized through the Reach Every Barangay strategy.

7. Health education and information campaigns shall be intensiﬁed at the ground level especially among the disadvantaged population to increase the proportion of mothers and caretakers practicing behaviors that promote child immunization.

8. The implementation of RA 7846, also known as Compulsory Hepatitis B immunization Among Infants and Children Less Than 8 Years Old and other laws and policies for the protection of infants shall be pursued.

VII. IMPLEMENTING GUIDELINES

A. New Immunization Schedule

The ﬁrst dose of Hepatitis B vaccine shall be administered as soon as possible within 24 hours after birth. The subsequent two doses shall be given with the ﬁrst and third dose of DPT and OPV to avoid the need for any additional visits. Table 1 indicates the recommended ages for the routine administration of the Hepatitis B vaccine. Any dose not administered at the recommended age should be administered at any subsequent visit when indicated and feasible. There is no need to restart vaccination series regardless of the time that has elapsed between doses.

B. Vaccine Type, Routes and Sites of Administration

B.l Type of Vaccine

Recombinant or genetically engineered vaccines using HBsAg (10 mg dose) synthesized in yeast or mammalian cells into which the HBsAg gene has been inserted.

B.2 Formulations

Hepatitis B vaccines are available in monovalent formulations that protect only against Hepatitis B, and in combination formulations that protect against Hepatitis B and other diseases (DTP-HepB, DTP-HepB + Hib, Hib-HepB).

Only monovalent Hepatitis B vaccine MUST BE USED for the birth dose.

Combination vaccines that include Hepatitis B MUST NOT BE USED for the birth dose of Hepatitis B vaccine because DTP and Hib vaccines should not be administered at birth.

Either monovalent Hepatitis B vaccine or combination vaccines may be used for later doses in the hepatitis vaccine schedule. Combination vaccines can be given whenever all the antigens in the vaccines are indicated:

B.3 Presentation

Hepatitis B (HepB) vaccine is a liquid vaccine available as a single antigen formulation (monovalent) or in combination with other antigens (e.g. DPT-HepB or DPT-HepB—Hib) as combination vaccine. Both monovalent and combination vaccine are available in single—or multi-dose vials (2, 6 and 10 dose vials). Only monovalent HepB vaccine should be used for birth dose, as DPT contained in combination vaccines can cause adverse reaction and has reduced immunogencity if given less than 6 weeks of age. Combination vaccines may be used for subsequent doses.

Currently all the hepatitis B vaccine under the program is being supplied as 10-dose vials of monovalent vaccine.

B.4 Dosage

The standard pediatric dose is 0.5 ml.

B.5 Sites of Administration

The recommended series of 3 doses of Hepatitis B vaccine shall be given intramuscularly only in the anterolateral thigh muscle.

When hepatitis B vaccine is administered to infants at the same time as another injectable vaccine, the vaccine should be administered in different thighs. However, if more than one injection has to be given in the same limb the injection. sites should be 2.5 cm to Scm apart so that local reactions are unlikely to overlap.

The preferred injection device for Hepatitis B vaccine shall be a 0.5ml auto-disable (AD) injection syringe with any of the 25mm, 22-, or 23- gauge needle.

The following practices shall be avoided:

- Hepatitis B vaccine SHOULD NOT be given in the buttocks. There may be a risk of injury to the sciatic nerve.

- Hepatitis B SHOULD NOT be administered intradermally because this does not produce adequate antibody response to the children.

- Hepatitis B SHOULD NOT be mixed in the same syringe with other vaccines.

C. Vaccine Storage & Handling

Hepatitis B vaccine shall be transported, stored and handled similar to DPT and Tetanus Toxoid (TT) vaccines. It should be stored in refrigerators provided solely for vaccine storage at +2 to +8°C. ' It should be transported properly in ice—packed containers with cold chain monitors or thermometers. Hepatitis B vaccine like DPT and TT should NEVER BE FROZEN or allowed to come into direct contact with ice because the vaccine will be inactivated and will no longer be potent. Twice daily temperature monitoring is critical. Speciﬁc vaccine storage requirements are described in detail in the Cold Chain and Logistics Manual. The “Shake test” should be used to determine if the vaccine has been damaged by freezing.

All Hepatitis B vaccine supplied by DOH comes with attached “Vaccine Vial Monitor” (VVM). VVM should be regularly read before using the vaccine to assess heat damage to the vaccine.

Since hepatitis B vaccine is also supplied with a preservative, “Multi-dose Vial” policy will also be applicable to Hepatitis B vaccine as is the case with DPT, OPV and TT. Multi-dose policy states that if one or more doses of OPV, DPT, TT and Hepatitis B vaccines have been removed during an‘immunization sessions, this may be used in subsequent sessions for four weeks provided the following conditions are met:

- Expiry date has not passed;
- Vaccines are stored under appropriate cold chain conditions;
- Vaccine vial septum has not been submerged in water;
- Aseptic technique has been used to withdraw all doses;
- The Vaccine Vial Monitor, if attached, has not reached its discard point

D. Indications and Contraindications

There are no contraindications for the administration of Hepatitis B vaccine to a newborn within 24 hours of birth.

Low birth weight or premature delivery are not contraindications to Hepatitis B vaccination. If the birth weight is less than 2000 grams, a birth dose and three additional doses should be given.

E. Vaccine Side Effects and Adverse Reactions

Hepatitis B vaccine is one of the safest vaccines. Mild reactions include:

- Soreness. About 5% of children may develop tenderness, redness, or mild swelling at the injection site.
- Fever. About 1% to 6% of those who receive the vaccine may develop a mild fever that lasts 1—2days after injection of the vaccine.

Anaphylaxis is the only known serious reaction to Hepatitis B vaccine. The risk of anaphylaxis is estimated at l per 600,000 doses. No fatal reaction has been reported.

F. Administration of Hepatitis B Vaccine Birth Dose

While the 2nd and 3rd dose of Hepatitis B vaccine shall be administered along with ﬁrst and third dose of DPT and OPV, administration of the ﬁrst dose within 24 hour of birth requires further instructions, which will vary depending on the place of birth. The following speciﬁc instructions/guidelines for administration of birth dose of Hepatitis B vaccine shall be implemented.

1) Hospitals & Lying-In Clinics

a. Supply of vaccine to hospitals/hing in clinics: All regions/provinces/cities/municipalities shall supply the Hepatitis B vaccine to different hospitals/clinics that provide in—patient maternity health services on a quarterly/monthly basis based on the average number of births in that health facility. Regional/provincial/city/municipal cold chain manager must assess that proper cold chain equipment is available for storage of the vaccines.

All hospitals shall submit the quarterly number of deliveries and birth dose vaccines delivered to the region prior to receipt of the allocated vaccines.

b. The health facility shall store/handle the vaccine as per the recommendations listed above, near the labor/matemity room, where the staff assisting the child-birth can easily access the vaccine.

c. The staff responsible for providing birth dose shall be clearly designated in the health facility and shall provide the recommended dose of monovalent vaccine to the newborn as soon as possible within 24 hours of birth. No mother/child should be discharged; from the hospital without providing the birth dose of Hepatitis B vaccine to the newborn.

d. Provision of birth dose of Hepatitis B vaccine should be included as part of the standing orders for the routine care of medically stable infants weighing equal to or more than 2000 grams at birth.

e. The health facility shall submit a monthly report to the next higher level (municipality/city/province, etc.) on the total number of births in a health facility and total number of newborns given timely birth dose and those given vaccine after 24 hours of birth (with reasons).

f. Recording of the birth dose: The health facility shall record the date and time of the birth dose in the Early Childhood Care and Development (ECCD) card/Growth Monitoring Card (GMC)/Mother and Child Book/Immunization Card and give it to the mother/caretaker.

If no such cards are available in the health facility, the "vaccinator shall give a referral note indicating that the vaccine was given including the date and time of administration, to the care-givers with the instructions for future vaccinations. An additional column will be added in the maternity register to record whether the birth dose was given. This information will be used to compile the monthly report to be sent to the higher level as mentioned previously.

g. All vaccinator shall inform the mother/caregiver on the common reactions of Hepatitis B immunization and the importance of the completion of the vaccination.

2) Health Centers/ and Barangay Health Stations

a. All health centers and BHS shall follow the revised schedule of Hepatitis B immunization among infants as provided in these guidelines.

b. Health staff and BHWs shall promote in every opportunity, especially during prenatal consultation the importance of providing the ﬁrst dose of Hepatitis B vaccine as soon as possible within 24 hours of birth, so that the mother can ask/demand the vaccine from the providers at the time of childbirth. The mothers should also be educated about importance of getting complete series of hepatitis B and other immunizations.

c. All infants attended at bi1th by midwives from the health center/BHS shall be given the monovalent Hepatitis B vaccine within 24 hours after birth. The midwife shall carry with her a vaccine vial and a disposable syringe as part of midwifery kit while going to attend the birth.

d. Using the vaccine outside the cold chain: Since Hepatitis B vaccine is found to be relatively heat stable, it is recommended that midwife can carry the hepatitis B vaccine outside the vaccine carrier for birth dose purposes as long as the VVM is not past discard point. However, in the health center, the vaccine should be kept in the cold chain as far as possible. In the event, single dose vaccine vials are supplied under the program, the midwives will use single dose vials for Hepatitis B birth dose, and multiple dose vials for 2nd and 3rd dose. The MVDP shall be adopted in this situation as long as it is not taken out of cold chain.

3) Birth taking place outside health facilities attended by traditional birth attendants (TBAs) or other non-trained providers

Midwives in the BHS/health center should enquire about the place and provider of the birth services during prenatal consultations. In case, the pregnant woman decides to have her delivery attended by TBA, the TBA or the mother should be advised to inform the nearest health facility either by phone or by personal visit for the provision of the HepB and BCG or should bring the newborn to the health facility for vaccination or a midwife to give immunization during house visit within 7 days after delivery. The midwife at BHS/health center should provide the hepatitis B vaccine as soon as possible after getting the information along with other post-natal services.

G. Calculation of Hepatitis B Vaccine Needs

The following are the steps for calculating Hepatitis B requirement:

a. Identify the important data for computation:

- Eligible Population (EP) of Infants
- EP = Total Population (TP) X 3%
- Wastage Multiplier : 1.2

National:
- Reserve Stock : 25%
- Reserve stock Multiplier : . 1.25

Region/Province/City :
- Reserve Stock : 12.5 %
- Reserve stock Multiplier : 1.125

Municipality:
- Reserve Stock F : 12.5 %
- Reserve stock Multiplier : 1.1

b. Formula

Hep B requirements at national/provincial/city level = EP x Number of doses x wastage multiplier x reserve stock multiplier

c. Hep B requirements at lower level = EP x Number of doses x wastage multiplier x reserve stock multiplier

d. Example Computation

Given: Province A with a total population of 2,000,000 for 2006. Compute for the annual requirements for Hepatitis B.

d.1 Compute for the eligible population infants for Province A.

2,000,000 x 0.03 = 60,000 infants

d.2 Calculate for the annual needs (in doses) for Province A.

60,000 x 3 doses x 1.2 x 1.125 = 243,000 doses

d.3 Calculate for annual needs (in vials) for Province A.

243,000 doses + 10 doses per vial = 24,300 vials

In the event the single dose vials are made available for Hepatitis B, one-third of all requirements should be estimated for single dose and the rest in 10- dese vials.

H. Recording & Reporting

All vaccination given to infants shall be appropriately recorded in the Early Childhood Care and Development (ECCD) Card/Growth Monitoring Card (GMC)/Mother and Child Book/Immunization Card as well as in the Target Client List (TCL) by midwives or nurses in the facility where the infant is registered.

The Hepatitis B immunization series (Hep Bl, HepB2 & HepB3) shall be included in the deﬁnition of the fully immunized child (FIC). Thus, a fully immunized child shall be deﬁned as an infant who received 1 dose of BCG, 3 doses each of DPT, OPV, Hepatitis B and anti-measles before reaching 12 months old.

While ideally a birth dose is, given 24 hours, full accounting of Hepatitis B doses administered regardless of site of delivery is required. Thus, the recording of the Hepatitis B is as follows:

<image>table_2.png</image>
 
I. Monitoring & Evaluation

The primary method of monitoring will be through routine Hepatitis B1-3 coverage reports and seroprevalence surveys. Birth dose and Hepatitis B3 shall be included in the standards for Sentrong Sigla Certiﬁcation.

Impact of the Hepatitis B immunization on Hepatitis B related mortality and morbidity will not be immediately visible as current immunization only protects the future generation with no impact on population already chronically infected. Hence, monitoring of hepatitis B vaccination especially in the short term will require special methods such as regular seroprevalence surveys of the children home after the start of vaccination program, and acute disease surveillance. However, considering the demonstrated efﬁcacy of Hepatitis B vaccine, the vaccine coverage data can provide indirect evidence of program impact on Hepatitis B infection.

It is suggested that following indicators be regularly monitored at all levels (regional, provincial, municipality, city and district):

1) Percent of infant who are immunized with three doses of Hepatitis B vaccine (HepB3 %)

2) Percent of infants receiving ﬁrst dose within 24 hours of birth (timely birth dose %) separately for the infants born at home and infants born in health facilities.

3) % Drop out rate from Hepatitis B1 to Hepatitis B3.

4) % Difference between DPT3 and Hepatitis B3.

The national level 'should undertake at least one serosurvey of HBsAg prevalence in vaccinated cohorts within 5 years of sustained high 3 doses Hepatitis B coverage and at least 50% of timely birth dose following the recommended WHO survey design.

J. Advocacy and Social Mobilization

The nature of Hepatitis B means that special advocacy and social mobilization efforts are needed as the disease burden is sometimes not recognized (considering the lag period between time of infection and manifestation of disease late in life) and vaccinating newborn infants may be difﬁcult in some societies. The efforts need to include ensuring that health workers are fully informed as to the importance of hepatitis B immunization in preventing chronic liver disease and cancer.
