<body>
 

I. RATIONALE 

One of the three strategic directions of the Universal Health Care is the attainment of the Millennium Development Goals (MDG). MDG 6 calls to combat HIV/AIDS, malaria, and other diseases, including TB. Consistent with the MDGs, the goal of the 2010 - 2016 ' Philippine Plan of Action to Control Tuberculosis (PhilPACT) is to reduce TB prevalence . and mortality rates by half compared to 1990 ﬁgures. The National TB Control Program (NTP) targets are 90% Case Detection Rate and at least 90% Treatment Success Rate. Accurate and prompt diagnosis of TB both susceptible and drug- -resistant TB (DRTB), is critical in achieving these targets. As such, one of the 8 strategies of PhilPACT IS to regulate and make available quality TB diagnostic tests and drugs. Performance targets under this strategy include: ensuring that 90% of participating diagnostic services are within quality standard; TB microscopy expanded to improve access; and, Culture, Drug Susceptibility Test (DST) and new technologies are scaled up. 

The bacteriologic diagnosis of TB currently relies on Direct Sputum Smear Microscopy (DSSM). The test has an acceptable level of sensitivity and speciﬁcity in high TB-burden settings. It 15 relatively cheap, easy to perform by trained and proﬁcient health workers, and can be easily set up even in remote areas However, in patients with pauci- -bacillary disease (smear negative pulmonary TB) particularly among persons living with HIV (PLHIV) with TB co-infection, children, and the immune-compromised, the test has inadequate sensitivity and can easily miss the diagnosis. 

Culture for AFB, including DST, is utilized by the NTP to detect patients with drug- resistant TB The test is available only in a limited number of specialized laboratories Moreover, turnaround time for the results takes several months which contributes to patients being lost even before diagnosis is made and treatment is started. 

Chest X—ray is still used to complement bacteriologic testing to make a diagnosis but this has low accuracy in diagnosing active PTB and does not differentiate drug-susceptible - 

from drug- resistant disease. Histologic examination of specimens other than sputum is occasionally resorted to for detection of extra-pulmonary TB. However, these tests are not readily accessible for most presumptive TB patients. 

New diagnostic technologies for TB, such as the nucleic acid ampliﬁcation test (NAAT), have been introduced and endorsed by the World Health Organization (WHO) for use by country TB control programs. In 2010, WHO endorsed Xpert MTB/RIF, a NAAT that operates on a fully automated platform that can detect Mycobacterium tuberculosis 1n sputum specimens including strains that are resistant to Rifampicin. Xpert MTB/RIF can produce results in about two hours. This is critical especially for patients in need of immediate treatment including advanced TB disease, and TB/HIV patients. Many countries have adopted this technology. 

The Philippines started using the Xpert MTB/RIF machines in 2011 in a phased manner and currently has 30 machines in use. For 2014, international partners will assist the country procure more Xpert MTB/RIF machines. Under the 2013 — 2016 Laboratory Network Strategic Plan (LNSP), the country targets to have at least 155 in operation to ensure that all provinces and cities have access to this rapid diagnostic tool. Furthermore, some private laboratories are also using this diagnostic test. It is imperative that this machine be effectively and efﬁciently used to support the efforts of the country to control TB. Thus, this issuance has been formulated.

A biosafety cabinet is not a requirement for the performance of Xpert MTB/RIF Assay for sputum specimens. 

3. Preferably, tissue samples must be processed within the biological safety cabinet, given the risk of producing aerosols while grinding and homogenizing samples. However, meticulous observance of good microbiological process, sound infection control, risk assessment and biosafety needs to be in place in the absence of BSC (source: NTL Standard Operating Procedure for Xpert MT B/RIF Assay for Extrapulmonary Specimen).

4. The facility shall practice First Expiring, First Out (FEFO) in using Xpert MTB/RIF cartridges. The facility shall inform DOH - ROS of cartridges expiring in the next 3 months as soon as possible. DOH - RO shall notify NTRL of quarterly allocation and pending nearly expiring cartridges as reported by the facility. 

5. Maintenance and calibration of Xpert MTB/RIF machines shall follow current WHO and manufacturer’s recommendations. Xpert MTB/RIF machine calibration shall be coordinated by NTRL and shall be done annually by an NTRL-approved service provider. 

6. The-facility shall immediately report machine—related problems, which are beyond the troubleshooting capability of the operator to the DOH - ROs for appropriate action by NTRL and/or the authorized service provider.
