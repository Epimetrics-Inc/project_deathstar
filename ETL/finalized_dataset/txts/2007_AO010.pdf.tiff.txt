<body>
I. BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE

The World Health Organization reported that injuries have become a major public health problem throughout the world. Injuries accounted for 9% of the world's death in 2000. (World Health Report) In industrialized countries, intentional and unintentional injuries have become the 3rd most important cause of overall mortality and main cause death among 1- 40 year old age group. (World Health Report 2000) There is evidence moreover that the incidence of injuries is growing.

The multi-factorial causes give injuries a prominent position among health problems. It represents 12% of the global burden of diseases. (WHO 2000) The WHO estimated that 5.1 million people worldwide died from injuries in 2000, which corresponds to a rate of 87.3/100,000 populations. 112/100,000 male population and 549/100,000 female populations. By the year 2020 it is expected that road traffic crashes will account for the 3rd highest cause of the global burden of disease, jumping from its current ranking of ninth. (World Health Report 2000) Others like the interpersonal violence, self inflicted injuries, and wars are expected to rise also. (WHO 2000) Developing countries will be largely responsible for this predicted sharp rise, having already experienced a significant increase in road deaths throughout the last decade while high-income countries have sustained a steady decrease. (WHO2000) Within the Western Pacific Region, consisting of 20 member states that are considered middle to low income countries, the leading injury related causes of death are road traffic injuries (1st among 15-29 years old), interpersonal violence (2nd among 15-29 years old) and drowning (4th among 5-14 years old) (Global Burden of Diseases Project 2002).

Injury is a major contributor of ill health and disability. It can occur everywhere, at home, at work, in public places, during recreational and leisure activities or even in the conduct of legal activities or interventions. Injuries are not accidents or acts of fate, and these are preventable and predictable. By investing in injury prevention can save money and save lives. Injuries have substantial impact on the lives of every Filipinos.

Accidents consistently remain one of the leading causes of morbidity and mortality in the country. The Philippine Health Statistics from 1975 to 2002 revealed that. there has been an increasing trend of mortality due to accidents per 100,000 populations. Mortality rate increased from 19.1/100,000 population in 1975 to 42.3 in 2002 corresponding to 33,617 deaths, majority of which is caused by assaults (13,276); transport accidents (6,131); accidental drowning and submersion (2,871); and accidental falls (1,536). Accidents ranked 8th in 1975. 7th in 1985 and 6th in 1995 and 5111 in 2002 among the 10 leading causes of death.

Reports from the Traffic Management Group, showed that road accidents went down. This figure is contradictory to the reports from the Philippine General Hospital, that there is an increasing number of serious vehicle-related injuries wherein as much as 50 percent of emergency serious injuries admitted are vehicle related. (Road Crash: Of Numbers and Other Problems by Emerson Sanchez). Road safety problem shall pose a big problem if we do not know the real data. There shall be a good registry of road traffic accidents to identify and implement effective solutions to reduce traffic accidents.

Several actions were taken by individual government agency pertaining to road traffic accidents prevention, for instance: Land Transportation and Traffic Code, Seat Belt Law which was amended to include provision for child safety; helmet use; pedestrian lanes; and Bgy. Tanod assistance for crossing school children. Despite these laws and initiatives, the expected outcomes or impact are yet to be realized due to some pressing priorities. Another issue is the presence of different organizations involved in the prevention of accidents and injuries. They seemingly adhere to unclear levels and elements of integration. In parallel, they even lack clear direction for local implementation. Undoubtedly, the general public and the government should give importance to road safety and other causes of injuries. Government, in particular, should take the initiative in preventing, if not lessening, its negative effects through its various agencies, such as, the DOH, DOTC, PNP-TMG, DILG, DPWH, DepEd, MMDA, and others.

With the Fourmula One for Health as the current framework for health reforms, and the National Objectives for Health, 2006-2010, as its actualization, the DOH sets out government's vision for an injury-free Philippines. The Department would be better focused on equitably allocating efforts and resources to injury prevention by providing a clear-direction to necessary stakeholders, such as, other government agencies, organizations, local government units, and individuals.

II. DECLARATION OF POLICIES

The Program shall be guided by the following basic policies:

1.

• Education entails dissemination of information related to injury prevention. Strategies and programs can be targeted at the risk group identified in the populations.

• Enforcement and enactment strategies identify opportunities for injury prevention policy development and implementation.

• Engineering provides an effective way of reducing the impact of injury causes through the application of energy transmission designs.

• Economic incentives can be instrumental in pursuing injury prevention policies. An example is when it is utilized to provide access to injury prevention devices such as child restraint seats.

VII. SPECIFIC GUIDELINES

The program and action plans that are to be developed for each classification of injuries shall consider the following principles:

1. Health Promotion.
