<body>

I. BACKGROUND

According to the Center for Research on the Epidemiology of Disasters (CRED), the Philippines ranks first relative to other countries in the world in terms of the number of natural disasters these countries experienced for the past several years. The geographic location of the country makes its most vulnerable to disasters and hazards - natural and also, man-made. An average of 19 typhoons occur annually usually resulting in severe / flash flooding particularly in Metro Manila and in other lowland areas. There are also a number of incidents  involving volcanic eruptions given the existence of 200 volcanoes in the country,
17 of which are active. The most recent Mt. Pinatubo eruption resulted in lahar overflows and devastated practically most parts of Central Luzon. This was considered one of the worst volcanic eruptions in the world. Further, the country being located in the Paciﬁc seismic belt, there are five earthquakes occurring daily, most of which are imperceptible. In addition to all these natural disasters, the country has been beset with man-made disasters such as maritime and air mishaps, conflagration, worsened at times by armed - political or religious conflicts.

All these disasters result in economic losses, destruction of properties and crops, injuries, disabilities and deaths. Cognizant of the ill-effects and adverse implications of disasters, the government has instituted measures and established mechanisms to be more responsive to disasters and emergencies.


II. RATIONALE

The Department of Health (DOH), as the primary government instrumentality for health concerns, is one major player. It is one of the member agencies comprising the National Disaster Coordinating Council which is the lead agency in coordinating, integrating, supervising and implementing disaster-related functions. While the 1991 Local Government Code has transferred the responsibility for health services from the DOH to the local government units (LGUs), one of the remaining functions of DOH is disaster management focused on preparedness and prevention. Immediate and direct response to disasters is the primary responsibility of the LGUs. 

In cases where disasters have reached proportions, which are beyond the capability of the LGUs, the national government takes control. Under Section 105 of the Code, in the event of ‘epidemic, pestilence and other widespread public dangers’, the Secretary of the Department of Health may, upon the direction of the President and in consultation with the government unit concerned, temporarily assume direct supervision and control over health operations in any LGU for the duration of the emergency. Chapter 11 of the Department of Health Rules and Regulations Implementing the Local Government Code of 1991 incorporates the following provisions:

a. defines ‘widespread public dangers’ to include situations in calamity areas and in relation to a displaced population [Section 43 (a)];
b. establishes guiding principles; including :
- the exercising of such authority with a view to enhancing and strengthening the capabilities of LGU’s to provide health services and facilities to their constituents, and
- the authority of DOH to have the final say in determining the presence of ‘widespread public dangers’ in a particular area or region [Section 44 (b) and (c)], and
c. establishes procedures, including those of :
- recommendation to the President for the issuance of an appropriate order directing the DOH to assume direct supervision and control over local health Operations in affected areas, and
- DOH performance of the functions of preparing, implementing and monitoring plans of actions in such circumstances , and of evaluation of the local health situation [Section 45, (c) and (f)].

These provisions provide the legal basis for the DOH to establish and maintain an effective health emergency preparedness and response (HEPR) program.

It is towards these that DOH established the Disaster Management Unit (DMU) in 1993. Through the DMU, a comprehensive, integrated and efficient mechanism of managing health and health-related disasters in all three phases of the disaster cycle — pre-disaster, emergency and post-disaster has been put into place. Furthermore, DMU acts as the nerve center or the Operation Center where all vital information are sent and which in turn, triggers response and mobilization by DOH.

In February 1994, DOH initiated the STOP D.E.A.T.H. Program — an acronym for Strategic Tactical Option for the Prevention of Disasters, Epidemics, Accidents and Trauma for Health which is an innovative strategy to consolidate the resources and capacities of DOH towards a coherent and effective response in times of crises or emergencies. It emphasizes the crucial role of the regions and the hospitals in establishing a national and health emergency network and aims at institutionalizing emergency preparedness, planning and responsiveness in the periphery and the active participation of health sectors and the community. By 1995 the program has put in place active participation of 38 retained hospitals and 16 regions in different levels of implementation. Furthermore, it became a byword in emergency services being the frontline in major emergencies and national activities.

There are other offices and programs whose services and expertise are needed in disasters and emergencies. The major functions, however, are played by DMU and STOP DEATH. For a better, more responsive and effective, monitoring coordination and response to disasters at all levels within the DOH, there is a need to integrate and merge the two offices. This will also minimize or avoid overlapping of functions such as training, emergency services, reporting mechanisms. Such overlapping and duplication of responsibilities has caused confusion in the regional offices, the hospitals as well as in other national and international agencies.


III. THE PROGRAM, GOALS AND OBJECTIVES

A. THE PROGRAM

The Health Emergency Preparedness and Response Program (Stop D.E.A.T.H.) shall be a comprehensive, integrated and responsive emergency, disaster related service and research-oriented program manned by competent, dynamic, committed professionals. These services will be provided through a network of regional offices and DOH hospitals in collaboration with different agencies, government and non-government organizations.

B. GOAL

To promote health emergency preparedness among the general public and to strengthen the health sector’s capability to respond to emergencies, disasters and calamities.

C. SPECIFIC OBJECTIVES

a. Establishing an integrated system for emergency preparedness/response and management within the Department of Health.
b. Enhancing the capabilities of the health sector in effective and efficient disaster and emergency response.
c. Promoting emergency preparedness through networking, inter-sectoral collaboration, technical assistance and training and development. 
d. Supporting researches on health emergency preparedness and management and response.
e. Developing a risk reduction framework for health emergency preparedness and policy development.

D. KEY RESULT AREAS:

a. Capacity Building - this includes training on health emergency preparedness in all levels of the health sector, from the community to the tertiary levels.
b. Service Delivery — this should aim at providing timely and appropriate responses in emergency situations. Likewise, competent, compassionate and dedicated professionals would provide the service.
c. Public Information and Advocacy — this activity aims at informing the public on prevention and preparedness for disasters, basic first aid in managing emergencies at home, at the work place and other public places; and coordinating with other concerned agencies to secure public commitment and support for the implementation of the Program.
d. Networking and Social Mobilization — this aims to network and collaborate with various sectors from the government and the private organizations for advocating and implementing the objectives and activities of the Program.
