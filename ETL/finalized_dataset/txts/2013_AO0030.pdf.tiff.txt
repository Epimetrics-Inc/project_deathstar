<subject>SUBJECT: Revised Guidelines in the Monitoring and Epidemiological Assessment of Mass Drug Administration on Lymphatic Filariasis </subject>
<body>


I. BACKGROUND/RATIONALE: 

Lymphatic Filariasis (LP) is endemic in 80 countries and territories with over a billion people are at risk of developing it and an estimated 120 million people are affected worldWide. Although not fatal, WHO has ranked LF as one of the world’s leading causes of permanent and long-term disability wherein 40 million are debilitated and disﬁgured by the disease. The Global Program to. Eliminate Lymphatic Filariasis (GPELF) was launched by the World Health Organization (WHO) in 2000 with several partners supporting the alliance. The Program includes two main components, interrupting transmission of lymphatic ﬁlariasis and managing morbidity and preventing disability. 

There is a need to effectively monitor, assess epidemiologically and evaluate the program implementation towards interrupting LF transmission. Likewise, there is a need for the following: a.) to ensure that national elimination program have the best available information on methodologies and procedures to monitor Mass Drug Administration (MDA) and adequately assess infection reduction to levels where transmission is likely no longer sustainable, b.) implement appropriate surveillance after stopping MDA to determine whether reemergence has occurred and; c.) prepare for veriﬁcation of the absence of transmission at the national level. 

In the Philippines, the disease/is endemic in 44 provinces, with ten provinces as of 2011 already achieving the crlteria for elimination as a public health problem namely, of Microﬁlaria Rate (MFR) of &lt 1% and Antigen Rate (AgR) of &lt 1%. The ten provinces include Southern Leyte, Sorsogon, Biliran, Agusan Sur, Bukidnon, Romblon, Dinagat Province, Cotabato Province, Compostela Valley and Marinduque. More than half of the affected areas are in Mindanao While the rest are in Visayas & Luzon. The regions with most LF disabilities are Bicol, Davao and Zamboanga Peninsula while others are in the progress of deformity mapping based on Regional program data. 

In 2010, the WHO published GPELF’s progress report and strategic plan to review the ﬁrst 10 years of the Programme and outline an approach and milestones for the second 10 years. Among the milestones in the Strategic Plan was to publish revised guidelines for monitoring and evaluation of national LF elimination programmes (Annex 1). While the MDA is scaling up and many provinces in the country are attaining the reduction of the MFRs and AgRs based on the results of the Midterm Sentinel Surveys, updating procedures for monitoring and evaluation to interrupt transmission is needed. 

II. OBJECTIVE

To guide public—private health providers in the effective monitoring, assessment and evaluation of the program implementation towards achieving the goal of elimination of ﬁlariasis as a public health problem in the country. 

III.SCOPE 

This order shall apply to all public- private health providers in ﬁlariasis endemic provinces. 

IV. DEFINITION OF TERMS 


1. Absence of LF transmission-reduction in transmission of the parasite to a level where continued transmission is very nil. 

2. Critical cut-off-the threshold of infection prevalence below which transmission is likely no longer sustainable, even in the absence of control interventions. The transmission assessment survey estimates this threshold by the number of antigen- positive or antibody-positive cases. 

3. Drug coverage-proportion of individuals, expressed as a percentage, in a targeted population who swallowed a drug, or a combination of drugs. 

4. Enumeration area-the smallest area for which census population results are available. 

5. Evaluation unit (EU)—a study area selected for implementation of the transmission assessment survey, which can comprise multiple implementation units, or part of an implementation unit. 

6. Implementation unit (IU)— the administrative unit in a country which is used as the basis for making decisions about implementing MDA. The IU must be deﬁned before mapping takes place.

7. Net primary-school enrolment ratio-the number of children enrolled in primary school that belong to the age group that ofﬁcially corresponds to primary schooling, divided by the total population of the same age group. 

8. Preventive chemotherapy-the use of anthelminthic drugs, either alone or in' combination, as a public health tool against helminth infections. MDA is on modality of preventive chemotherapy. 

9. School entrants- school children 6-7 years old enrolled in a s

10. Sentinel site-a geographical area, with a population of at least 500 people, selected in order to collect parasitological data to monitor the success of the program. It should remain the same throughout the course of the program. 

11. Spot-check site-a geographical area, with a population of at least 500 people, selected in order to collect parasitological data to complement data collected in sentinel sites. Spot-check sites should be chosen for each assessment and will change over the course of the program. 

12. Transmission assessment survey (TAS) - a survey designed to measure whether evaluation units have lowered the prevalence of infection to a level where recrudescence is unlikely to occur, even in the absence of MDA interventions. 

V. GENERAL GUIDELINES 

1. The Department of Health shall provide technical assistance to LGUs in the implementation of the Revised Guidelines in the Monitoring and Evaluation for Lymphatic Filariasis. 

2. DOH shall ensure that the Rapid tests, the immunochromato graphic Test for Filariasis shall be provided for the conduct of the Midterm Sentinel Surveys and the Transmission Assessment Surveys in all endemic provinces that passed the Pre-TAS criteria. 

3. The conduct of the Midterm Sentinel Surveys shall be in collaboration with the endemic LGUs. 

4. The conduct of the TAS will be in collaboration with the LGUs and DepEd. 

5. DOH shall provide training for the LGUs and DepEd relative to the conduct of TAS. 

VI. SPECIFIC GUIDELINES AND PROCEDURES 

1. In choosing the sentinel and spotcheck sites for the Midterm Sentinel Surveys, the population of the area shall have at least 500 populations in order to get at least 300 samples 1n each site. 

2. In survey intended to get the baseline prevalence in each province, there shall be two sentinel sites. 

3. In endemic provinces that are already implementing MDA and is due for a Midterm Sentinel Survey, an additional spotcheck site shall be added to the two sentinel sites. 

4. On data collection in sentinel and spot-check sites, the following schedule shall be followed: baseline, before the third MDA, before fourth MDA (optional), before sixth MDA (a sixth MDA shall likely be conducted in any case). 

5. The Measurement of clinical manifestations shall be excluded in the evaluation parameters. 

6. On Geographical area for Transmission Assessment Survey (TAS), Evaluation Unit shall be the same as the Implementation Unit which is the province. 

7. On other criteria for implementing TAS, a Pre—TAS shall be done to include the following, Prevalence of Mf is &lt 1.% in sentinel and spot check sites after the last MDA, with at least 65% coverage of total population in each MDA. 

8. On TAS design, the following shall be followed, In school-based survey, children in ﬁrst and second years of primary school whereas In community-based survey, children aged 6—7 years old. 


9. On performing the TAS, the diagnostic tool to be used shall be ICT. 


10. On TAS cut-off criteria, in areas where Aedes is the principal vector. Ag &lt 1% shall be used. 

11. On Post-MDA surveillance, TAS shall be again carried out at approximately 2— 3years. Ongoing surveillance shall begin as early as possible. 

12. In using the Survey Sample Builder, Aedes vector shall be used as one of the basis for the computation of samples.
