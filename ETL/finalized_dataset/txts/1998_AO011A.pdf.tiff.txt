<subject>SUBJECT: Guidelines in the Utilization of the Regional Primary Health Care (PHC) Funds as Approved in the General Appropriations Act (GAA), Republic Act No. 8522 of CY 1998.</subject>

<body>

I. Rationale

The Department of Health (DOH) continues to pursue PHC in support of the devolved health functions of the local government units (LGUs). In remaining true to its constitutional mandate and the spirit of the PHC policy for community health development, the DOH shall prioritize support to the basic sectors in the poorest municipalities in the country. The PHC fund shall therefore be utilized to build capabilities of the basic sectors in the marginalized communities to address basic minimum health needs and to manage a sustainable health care system. Given the devolved situation, the focus for the 1998 implementation of the PHC is to contribute to the concerted efforts of the government in reducing poverty by 30% in 1998 as far as the minimum basic needs are concerned.




II. Regional Primary Health Care Funds:


1. Regional funds to assist PHC programs of LGUs under R.A. 8522 or the GAA of CY 1998 are directly released by the Regional Field Offices of the Department of Budget and Management. The total amount is one hundred forty three million six hundred eleven thousand pesos (P143,611,000) which includes the additional fund provided by national PHC funds totalling nineteen million six hundred eighty thousand pesos (P19,680,000). These additional funds have been allotted to the  regions on the basis of the total population, total number of 5th and 6th class municipalities, absence/lack of foreign funded projects and limited funding from the Health Development Fund and Health Development Program.
