<subject>SUBJECT: Revised Schedule of Fees for Certain Services Rendered by the Bureau of Health Facilities and Services and Centers for Health Development in Relation to the Regulation of Health Facilities and Services and Validity Period of License to Operate, Accreditation, Authority to Operate, and Clearance to Operate for Certain Health Facilities and Services</subject>

I. BACKGROUND/RATIONALE

On January 13, 2000, Executive Order No. 197 entitled Directing All Departments, Bureaus, Commissions, Agencies, Oﬂices and Instrumentalities of the National Government, Including Government-Owned or Controlled Corporations, To Increase Their Rates of Fees and Charges By Not Less Than Twenty Percent was issued by the Ofﬁce of the President. An earlier issuance, E.O. No. 159 s. 1994, also directed government ofﬁces to adjust their fees and charges by just and reasonable rates sufﬁcient to cover the full cost of services rendered. However, compliance by government ofﬁces to this E.O. was poor.

Since 13.0. 197, the Bureau of Health Facilities and Services (BHFS) has revised its schedule of fees for regulatory services several times, through Administrative Order No. 104 s. 2000 Revised 2000 Schedule of Fees for Services Rendered by BLR, BRL, BFAD and NQO; A. O. No. 102 s. 2002 for the Schedule of Fees for regulatory services for hospitals and other health facilities (i.e. Birthing Homes, Psychiatric Care Facilities); A.O. No. 118 s. for clinical laboratories; and AD. 2005—0029 for dialysis clinics and ambulatory surgical clinics. Except for dialysis clinics and ambulatory surgical clinics, regulatory fees for health facilities have not been reviewed for the last four years.

On examination of the current fees charged by the BHFS, the fees are still very minimal compared to the actual cost of services, despite the recent adjustments. Thus for the last ﬁve years and may be even before, the Department of Health is in effect subsidizing the entry of both public and private entities in the health services market.

Under the reform mechanisms of Fourrnula One for Health, the restructuring and rationalization of fees of regulatory ofﬁces is one of the strategies formulated to support and sustain the needed reforms in health regulation. When a rationalized fee schedule is coupled with an income retention policy and performance—based fund allocation, the expected outcome is improvement in the efﬁciency, quality of services and client-responsiveness of regulatory ofﬁces.

In consideration of all of the above, the BHFS reviewed and revised the schedule of fees for regulatory services, basing the computation of fees on cost estimates of both labor and non—labor inputs used in the provision of services. Stakeholders’ comments and suggestions were taken into account in the ﬁnal revisions on the fee schedule.

Another reform strategy identiﬁed in Fourmula One for Health is to make health regulation more rational and client-responsive through less frequent more intensive regulatory procedures. During the stakeholders’ consultation mentioned above, as well as in other forums, it has been suggested that the validity period of a license/accreditation should be extended. Less frequent renewal of license/accreditation would be beneﬁcial for both the regulatory ofﬁces and their clients in terms of decreased cost. In order not to compromise the safety and quality of services in the regulated health facilities, a longer validity period should be coupled with more intensive monitoring and enforcement activities by the regulatory ofﬁces. However, the extension of the validity period of the license/accreditation can only be done for certain health facilities. For others, such as hospitals and clinical laboratories, the yearly renewal of the license is mandated by law.

II. OBJECTIVES:

This Administrative Order has the following objectives:

1. Prescribe a new schedule of fees for certain services rendered by the Bureau of Health Facilities and Services and the Centers for Health Development in relation to the regulation of health facilities and services
