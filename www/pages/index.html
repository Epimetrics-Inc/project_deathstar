                    I. BACKGROUND

                    Life expectancy is increasing Worldwide. According to the 2006 revision of the United Nations World Population Prospect Report for 2005- 2006 the Life Expectancy at birth in the Philippines is 4.5 years higher than the World average of 67.2 years and is the 5th highest among Southeast Asian countries. 

                    The increasing number of older Filipinos is the result of increasing life expectancy and reduction of fertility rate. Its implication in health care delivery has been recognized by the Government with the issuance of Republic Act (RA) No. 9994, the Expanded Senior's Citizens Act of 2010, which is an act granting additional beneﬁts and privileges to senior citizens, further amending RA No. 7432, otherwise known as “An AC1 to Maximize the Contribution of senior Citizens to Nation Building, Grant Benefits and Special Privileges and for other purposes. 

                    RA 9994 Section 5.C on Health states that “The DOH, in coordination with local government units (LGU’s), NGOs and POs fOr senior citizens, shall institute a national health program and Shall provide an integrated health- service for senior citizens... ” Throughout the country, there shall be established a “Senior citizens’ ward” in every government hospital. This geriatric ward Shall be for the exclusive use for senior citizens who are in need of hospital confinement by reason of their health conditions. However, when urgency of public necessity purposes so require such geriatric ward may be used for emergency purposes, after which, such "Senior citizens’ ward” shall be reverted to its nature as geriatric Ward. 

                    Full implementation of this R. A. needs the guidance and the availability of the National Standards on Patient Safety not only in hospitals or acute care setting but also in Long Term Care provision including that of nursing homes, community ambulatory and home care which Constitute the whole continuum of care to address the Special health needs of the Filipino Older Persons.


                    II. OBJECTIVES

                    A. To provide policy guidelines for standards of care for older persons in all healthcare settings: acute and sub—acute care, rehabilitation facility, continuing care retirement community and long term care.

                    B. To identify the basic rights of older persons, providing them dignity, safety, and protection from exploitation and any form of abuse or neglect.

                    C. To provide a guideline to safe and secure environments for older persons in all settings of care.

                    D. To strengthen the collaborative efforts among various Stakeholders engaged in the health service delivery for older persons to be accessible, of quality, more effective and efficient.

                    III. SCOPE

                    B. Comprehensive Geriatric Assessment (CGA) — a process which includes a multidimensional assessment of a person with increasing dependency, including medical, physical, functional, cognitive, pharmacotherapeutic status and social-environmental situation. May use standardized assessment instruments and an
                    interdisciplinary team to support the process.

                    C.

                    E. Decisional Capacity — an older person having four abilities: understanding, appreciation, reasoning and expression of choice. Understanding means that appropriately conveyed information is comprehended, retained long enough to be recalled in a discussion, and the relationships between interventions and outcomes are perceived. Appreciation involves the recognition of how appropriately conveyed information relates to a person’s specific circumstance, and can make insights about the relative advantages and disadvantages of a proposed solution.

                    Reasoning involves the manipulation of information to compare various alternatives and their consequences, and the justification of a rationale as a framework for such comparisons. Lastly, the expression of choice means the ability to communicate or convey a clear choice or decision. (Adapted from Hazard’s Geriatric Medicine and Gerontology Textbook, 6th edition)

                    L. Multidisciplinary Team - Consists of members of different disciplines, involved in the same task (assessing people, setting goals and making care recommendations) and working alongside each other, but functioning independently.

                    N. Quality of Life - The product of the interplay between social, health, economic and environmental conditions which affect human and social development. It is a broad-ranging concept, incorporating a person’s physical health, psychological state, level of independence, social relationships, personal beliefs and relationship to salient features in the environment.
