Emergency Room (ER) consultations in big hospitals (more than 100 bed capacity) can effectively catch most of the AFP cases. Early identification that is during the first 14 days after the onset of paralysis, is important in order to collect 2 steel specimens for poliovirus culture.

Paralysis: An Operational Manual for Field Health Workers 1996” has been issued out through the Maternal and Child Health Service (MCHS) (Annex A).
