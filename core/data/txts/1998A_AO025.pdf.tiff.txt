<subject>SUBJECT: Guidelines for the procurement of anti-TB drugs at the Regional Health Offices using the 1998 National Tuberculosis Program (NTP) funds</subject>

<body>

Rationale:

Due to the delay in the procurement of anti-TB drugs at the Central Office, the DOH management decided to decentralize this matter to the regional health offices (RHOs). This is to fast-track its purchase and distribution to prevent widespread shortage of anti-TB drugs at the implementing units. Hence, the
funds of the National TB Control Program (NTP) for drugs for 1998 will be sub-alloted to the fifteen RHOs. Drugs for ARMM shall be sub-alloted to the Regional Health Office No. XII, Cotabato City. The RHOs will conduct the procurement of the said drugs to be held simultaneously on December 14,1998


Amount of funds to be sub-alloted per region:

A total of P93,571,200 shall be sub-alloted to all the regions. Allocation for the TB Control Service (TBCS) for Central Office buffer stock shall be sub-alloted to  NCR. Breakdown by region is attached. TBCS allocated the funds by region based on the following; (1) total number of smear (+) TB cases found in the region in 1997 and the anticipated increase in 1999 especially for those with projects on DOTS strategy; (2) quantity of blister packs of anti-TB drugs needed per patient; and (3) estimated price per item. The price was based on the bid price provided by the suppliers last May, 1998. The quantity per type of drug may be changed by the RHOs based on their current inventory at the region and provincial / city health offices. However, the total cost must not exceed the amount sub-alloted to the RHOs. Guide for the computation of drug requirement per patient is attached.


Kinds of anti-TB drugs to purchase

The following antiâ€”TB drugs will be purchased for the use of the NTP in the provinces / cities of the region:

1. Short Course Chemotheraphy Type I 
2. Short Course Chemotheraphy Type II 

The specifications of these items is attached:

a) General Terms and Conditions
b) Special Provisions


Allocation and Distribution

The allocation list of the anti-TB drugs will be prepared by the regional NTP coordinators in consultation with the TBCS and the Local Government Units. Priority must be the smear (+) cases since the budget could only provide drugs for this category of TB cases.

Depending on the agreed mode of delivery with the provinces or cities, the RHOs must ensure that the anti-TB drugs are immediately distributed.


Monitoring

The RHOs must furnish the TB Control Service, OPHS and the Procurement Logistics Service, OMS, the following information:

a) Quantity of drugs purchased and price per item
b) Dates of bidding, issuance of purchase order and completion of delivery
c) Drug allocation by province / city
d) Problems / issues in the procurement of anti-TB drugs

These shall be consolidated and analyzed by TBCS in coordination with PLS. Report and recommendations shall be submitted to the Office for Public Health Service and Office of the Secretary.

The RHOs will monitor the distribution and utilization of anti-TB drugs in coordination with the provincial / city health offices.
