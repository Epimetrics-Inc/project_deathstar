<subject>SUBJECT: Adoption and Institutionalization of an Integrated Code Alert System within the health sector.</subject>

<body>
I. BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE: 

Most emergencies and disasters are unpredictable but are not totally unexpected. Some events which trigger disasters, such as typhoons and volcanic eruptions, or threats of civil disorders, maybe expected several hours before they occur. Others, such as earthquakes, may occur without warning. A stance of readiness to respond is assumed whenever potential emergencies are foreseen. Emergency management and control measures are usually indicated for those types of emergencies. Preventing measures, preparedness program are likewise helpful in mitigating or preventing the effects of such emergencies and disasters. All emergencies and disasters is a health concern. Whenever there are lives lost, injuries sustained, movement of large pepulations and even psychosocial disturbances the Department of Health plays a very vital role. All health facilities must get ready to respond whenever emergencies/disasters are foreseen and/ or declared. The organization of the medical care is unquestionably the focal point for coordinating for the health sector’s response to this host of complex needs, since response and prompt care is critically important in saving lives. 

With this concern, and in order to synchronize the efforts of the Department of Health leading the health sector and in anticipation of health emergencies, disasters, mass casualty incidents, epidemics, a Code Alert System must be in place specifically in the mobilization and deployment of its resources. This mechanism is adopted to describe the expected levels of preparation and the most suitable responses by all facilities in emergencies and disasters.
