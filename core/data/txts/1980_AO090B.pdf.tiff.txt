8.1 Professional Logistics

Basic

The Public School Dentist should always know the type and extent of the dental health problem of the school population. He should, with involvement of appropriate personnel always plan and evaluate the dental health program. He should seek ways and means to introduce fluorides whether systematically or self-administration or topically. He should provide oral examination to all school children to detect early carious lesion. He should be alert in the identification of oral cancer and handicapping labio-lingual deviations. He should provide prompt treatment of dental diseases and condition. Otherwise when not accommodated in the school dental clinic, cases should be referred and followed through to ensure dental care for such children by a mechanism of a referral system. He should provide chairside instruction to each child. He should provide content on dental health for health instruction and healthful school living to the teachers and personnel in the lunch counter who are directly in contact with teh school children.

8.1.1 How to determine the number of patients to be treated in each class or section.

During the ocular inspection of all pupils in a classroom, the school dentist should classify each pupil or student as A, B, and C, according to the seriousness of the dental defects found. When the number of working days alloted by the school authorities concerned to any school children, the following formula should be observed:

Multiply the average number of patients treated daily by the actual working days alloted for the school, then divide the product by the number of sections in the school to get the number of patients to be treated each section;

8.1.2 Calling of Patients -

In order to have a continuous flow of patients, the dental aide is instructed to call five (5) pupils to start the clinic hours in the morning. Each patient treated is sent back to the classroom with instruction to tell the teacher to send another five pupils for treatment. The dentist is not allowed to treat or keep a patient of the opposite sex alone in the clinic (Appendix 6).

8.1.3 Inspection of children for classification of cases:

The ocular dental examination should be done in the classroom. Pupils and/or students are classified according to three categories:

Class A - children having no dental defects but needing only prophylaxis and advice.
Class B - children having dental defects
Class C - children with serious dental defects

The objectives of the above classification is to give priority to those in great need of immediate dental treatment; to give dental inspection to all pupils in the school and to give the dentist opportunity to visit each class and have individual contact with each child and teachers in the school.

8.1.4 Permission Slips - (Appendix 7)

Before beginning the treatment, the dentist should see to it, that an adequate supply of permission slips is available. This form could be mimeographed upon request to the Principal or District Supervisor. The dentist should distribute the slips in the course of his ocular inspection for the classification of the patients. However, classroom teachers who received permission slips prior to the visit of the school dentist may distribute such slips to the pupils in their school. This is done in barrio schools where the stay of the school dentist is limited. All permission slips should be signed by the parents or guardians of the pupils for the following reasons:

a) To bring to the parents attention the presence of the visiting dentist in the school, hence, to awaken their consciousness to the dental health program.

b) Some children are under the care of a private dentist and whose parents would perhaps prefer to have their children be attended by such dentist;

c) Parents may wish to accompany their children to the clinic, especially in cases of highly nervous children who may refuse treatment without the presence of their parents.

d) In case of accident, during or after treatment, which sometimes is beyond human control, the permission slip duly signed by the parents protects the dentist from any legal responsibility. The signed permission slips are good for four (4) months after which new permission slips are required. Students and/or pupils who are 21 years of age or over may sign their permission slips. The slips should be pasted on the upper right back of the individual dental record.
