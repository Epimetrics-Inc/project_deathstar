<subject>SUBJECT: Strengthening the DOH Reproductive Health Program (Amendment to AO No. 1-A s. 1998)</subject>

<body>
 

I- Background/ Rationale

The 1994 International Conference on Population and Development (ICPD) emphasizes the link between population and sustainable development and recommends a comprehensive approach in formulating and implementing reproductive health policies and programs. Moreover, the 1995 International Conference on Women in Beijing, highlighted that empowering women is the key to a healthy and productive lives and called for the promotion of a reproductive health approach.

The Philippines as signatory to the Programme of Action of the ICPD subscribes to a consensus which include the broadening of population policies and programs beyond family planning and a much closer collaboration among development agencies as the primary mechanism to attain the reproductive health approach objectives. In line with this, the DOH has created the Philippine RH Program thru the Administrative Order # 1-As 1998 dated January 15, 1998.

To strengthen the program, there is a need to refocus the implementation of RH thru the following approaches;

1. Integrating services, emphasizing quality and expanding coverage through partnership programs with local government units, non-governmental organizations and the private sectors within the framework of the Health Sector Reform Agenda.

The program will create an environment for participation for stakeholders in the health sector to provide clients with high quality care by considering their perspective in the selection and delivery of services.

It will address the reproductive health needs not only of women and children but also underserved groups such as men and adolescents. Special attention will be given to marginalized groups especially the poor.

Integration of RH services in all health facilities as part of a basic package of health services and ensuring a referral system between primary to tertiary, public and private facilities, will result in great efficiency and effectiveness by requiring fewer provider—client contacts, sharing of facilities, and minimizing duplication. 

The program will also strive toward national self—reliance in providing services, medicines and supplies to support reproductive health services in the Philippines. Reforms in health financing for reproductive health will he a priority.

2. Improving the general health of all Filipinos, promoting personal responsibility and empowering communities to exercise reproductive health rights within the framework of the National Objectives for Health.

The program will be consistent with national programs to improve the health of Filipinos in general by promoting personal responsibility, disseminating information and emphasising freedom of choice in accessing to programs, services and information.

The program recognizes that the goals of reproductive health cannot be achieved independent of national goals and objectives for health in general. Hence, reproductive health will be seen as a fundamental part of basic health services and the exercise of reproductive rights will be promoted to empower individuals and communities to actively participate in achieving reproductive health goals and objectives.


II- Reproductive Health Framework

The ICPD defines Reproductive Health (RH), as a "state of complete physical, mental and social well being and not merely the absence of disease or infirmity, in all matters relating to the reproductive system and to its functions and processes.

Furthermore, Reproductive Health Care is defined as the constellation of methods, techniques and services that contribute to reproductive health and well being by preventing and solving RH problems. The services includes Maternal and Child Health and Nutrition, Family Planning, Prevention and Treatment of Reproductive Tract Infections (RTI), Breast and Reproductive Tract Cancers and other Gynecological Conditions, Prevention and Treatment of Abortion Complications, Men’s and Adolescent Health, Violence Against Women and Children, Prevention and Treatment of Infertility and Sexual Dysfunction, Education and Counseling on Sexuality and Sexual Health.

3. Adopt the Life Course Approach (LCA) and underscore the importance of reproductive health and rights at all stages of life regardless of gender, socioeconomic background, political or religious affinity; 
4. Ensure gender sensitivity as a cross—cutting intervention for all programs, projects and services;
5. Determine priorities in implementing various elements of reproductive health,and if necessary to use an incremental strategy for RH care provision based on risk analysis;
