<subject>Subject: RECORDING OF NON-PRESCRIPTION COUGH PREPARATIONS SUBJECT TO ABUSE</subject>

<body>
	Section 2.2.1.3.5, Chapter II of A.O. 56, s. 1989 requires record book for selected non-prescription drug products subject to abuse to be registered with BFAD. Such books should contain the data specified in the Annex “A” of this circular.
	Up to this date, there are continuing reports of abuse of cough preparation containing active ingredients that affect the central nervous system, despite the limitations prescribed in the volume of cough preparations and number of bottles that can be dispensed by drug outlets. The NARCOM and DDB statistics rank cough preparations as among the top three (3) of the substances abused.
	In the interest of public health and safety, there is an urgent need to closely monitor for the use/abuse of cough preparations containing active ingredients that affect the central nervous system. These active ingredients are the following:
	1. Dextromethorphan Hydrobromide
	2. Pseudoephedrine Hydochloride
	3. Codeine Phosphate
	4. Ephedrine Hydrochloride
	5. Dihydrocodeinone Bitartrate
	
		All drugstores, drug outlets, and pharmacies are therefore required to record in the prescribed record book the name and address including the identification card and/or community tax certificate of the buyer/purchaser of the cough preparation containing the aforedescribed active ingredients.
	Failure to maintain the system of the recording herein prescribed will be considered a deficiency in the requirements for drug outlet operation and will be a ground for revocation of the license to operate.
	All existing drugstores, outlets and pharmacies are given ten (10) days from this date to register the prescribed record book with BFAD through the Food and Drug Regulation Officer (FDRO) assigned in the area where they are located. Similarly, all FDRO’s are the respective record books of the existing drugstores within their respective area of assignment.
	The efficiency of this system of monitoring to curb the reported abuse of cough preparation will be assessed or evaluated one (1) year from this date.
	This Order shall be effective immediately upon approval.
