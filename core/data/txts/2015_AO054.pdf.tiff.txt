<body>



I. BACKGROUND 

Intestinal helminthiasis or soil—transmitted helminthiasis (STH) remains a global public health problem. It affects the most vulnerable sector of our society - the children aged 1 to 12 years old who are in a period of intensive physical and intellectual growth and special populations/ groups such as pregnant & lactating women, women of child bearing age, farmers, food handlers and others. STH infection has an adverse effect on cognitive development and school attendance and is also associated with nutritional deﬁciencies particularly iron and vitamin A. Signiﬁcant improvements in language, memory developments and iron status have been observed and vitamin A absorption after treatment of helminthiasis (WHO & UNICEF joint statement). 

A nationwide prevalence survey of soil-transmitted hehninthiasis among children 12- 71 months old revealed that 66% were infected (de Leon, Lumampao, 2004), while 54% among schoolchildren have worms (Belizario et a1, 2006). Recent evidence conﬁrmed the signiﬁcant reduction in the burden of. disease due to helrninths can be achieved through regular mass deworming directed to all high risk groups (WHO and UNICEF). Recognizing the high burden of worm infection, the DOH established the STH Control Program (STHCP) in 1999 through the issuance of Administrative Order No. 30-F S 1999. In 2006, the program was renamed as Integrated Helminth Control Program, IHCP (Administrative Order No. 2006-0028). 

Mass deworming of 1 to 12 years old children is done twice a year or every six months. For pre—school children aged 1-4 years old, deworming is done during the nationwide Garantisadong Pambata (GP) campaign during the months of April and October. Further, it is also important to note that deworming drugs are also available in all health centers nationwide. For the enrolled school-aged children (5-12 years old or kindergarten to Grade VI), school deworming is scheduled every July (Round 1) and January (Round 2) per A0 No. 2006-0028. Unenrolled school-aged children are dewormed at the health centers. 

Currently, albendazole 400mg or mebendazole 500mg are the drugs of choice for mass treatment of intestinal infections. Both drugs are included in the WHO model list of essential medicines for the single-dose treatment of STH. The anti-helminthic drugs are cost—effective so that regular mass treatment are both affordable and sustainable (WHO and UNICEF). 

Albendazole and mebendazole have an excellent safety record; adverse reactions are minimal and transient and serious adverse experiences are extremely infrequent. Temporary minor reactions following treatment ocCur mainly in infected people as a result of the body’s response to the dying worms. 

 
The heavily infected people are more likely to experience such reactions. Generally, the number of people reporting adverse reactions is highest at the ﬁrst round of treatment and tends to decrease during subsequent rounds (WHO). 

However, since the implementation of national deworming program, there are cases of reactions to deworming drugs that have not been documented. Hence, this guideline on the management of AEFD was developed and updated to prepare field workers in the management of any untoward reaction. Further, this will serve as a guide to document AEFD through reporting and recording from and to relevant ofﬁces. 

II. OBJECTIVES 

This Order aims to guide health workers and providers on the following: 

1. Administering deworming drugs to different age groups. 

2. Management of the adverse events following deworming. 

3. AEFD reporting and recording at different levels. 

III. SCOPE OF THE APPLICATION 

This order shall apply to all national, regional and local ofﬁces and stakeholders involved in the deworming program of the DOH. 

IV. DEFINITION OF TERMS 

1. Adverse drug reaction (ADR) is a noxious and unintended reaction, which occurs at doses normally used in humans for prophylaxis, diagnosis or treatment of disease, or for the modiﬁcation of physiological function (WHO). 

2. Adverse event following deworming (AEFD) or non—serious adverse event (N SAE) is a medical event that happens after ingestion of deworming drugs. While the drugs are safe and effective against helrninths, adverse reactions which are usually mild and transient may occur within 8 to 12 hours after ingestion. 

3. Eligible population is a group of individuals qualiﬁed or entitled to receive anti- helminthic treatment in preventive chemotherapy interventions (WHO). 

4. Mass deworming is the giving of anti-helminthic drugs or deworming drugs to the entire eligible population without prior diagnosis of current infection to get rid of intestinal parasites which include hookworm, ascaris, and trichuris. 

5. Mass Drug Administration Provider (MDAP)- a person who administers the deworming drugs. This can be any teacher supervised by a health worker from the Department of Health, Department of Education, Local Government Units, or volunteer groups (with prior approval from the DOH Regional Ofﬁce) who have the capacity and background in health, administration of deworming drugs, and management of adverse events. 

6. Pre—school aged children (Pre-SAC) are all children between the ages of 1 and 4 years who are not yet attending school but may be in the daycare centers. 

7. Preventive chemotherapy is the use of anti-helminthic drugs, either alone or in combination, as a public health tool against helrninth infections (WHO). 

8. School-aged children (SAC) are all children between the ages of 5 to 12 years old, enrolled or not enrolled, which falls between kindergarten to Grade VI in the Philippine curriculum context. 

9. Serious Adverse Events (SAE) is an adverse events following treatment with a drug that results in life- threatening condition. 

10. Soil-transmitted helrninthiasis (STH) is an infection caused by nematodes such as Ascarz's lumbricoides (roundworm), Trichuris trichiura (whipworrn) or hookworm. 

11. Severely malnourished children are those children whose weight or height is below the - 3SD when compared with WHO Child Growth Standards (CGS) using indicators of weight for height (severely wasted). 

V. GENERAL GUIDELINES 

1. The following drugs which are listed in Philippine National Drug Formulary (PNDF) and are recommended by World Health Organization shall be used for Mass Drug Administration (MDA): 

a. Albendazole 400 mg chewable, ﬂavored tablet 

b. Mebendazole 500 mg chewable. ﬂavored tablet 

2. The target population for MDA shall be composed of pre-scho‘vl 91- aged children (1-4 years old) and school aged children (5-12 years old). Special population (such as Women of childbearing age including pregnant women in the 2nd and 3rd trimesters and lactating women, high risk adults such as food handlers/operators, farmers, miners, soldiers and indigenous people) shall also receive deworming drugs thru selective treatment. 

3. The Mass Drug Administration Providers (MDAP) shall observe the following drug dosages and frequency of deworming by target groups:
