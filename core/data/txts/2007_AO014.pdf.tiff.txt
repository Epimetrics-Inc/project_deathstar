5. Inertization is a suitable treatment for pharmaceutical wastes while encapsulation and other immobilization techniques are treatment methods considered for sharps, chemicals and pharmaceutical wastes and should therefore be placed in final disposal facilities indicated under the subsequent Section.

C.3 Final Waste Disposal Systems and Facilities

The use of the proceeding disposal facilities should only be limited to health care wastes which have undergone the necessary treatment provided under the prescribed standards stipulated in the DOH Health Care Waste Management Manual.

C.3.1 Controlled Dump Facility

1. A Controlled Dump Facility (CDF) is an interim disposal facility for municipal solid waste or those that are considered as non-hazardous and non-toxic substances. In the absence of a sanitary landfill, a controlled dumpsite could accept health care waste after the indicative treatment thereof.

2. In addition to the operational guidelines stipulated under Section 2 of Rule XIII of the Implementing Rules and Regulations of RA 9003 or as indicated in the conditions stipulated in the issuance of the NTP, a CDF that is commissioned to accept treated health care waste should also be operated in accordance with the following specific requirements:

a. Identify a particular cell within the facility to serve as a site for the disposal of treated health care waste. The capacity of the alloted cell/cell(s) should be measured in order to determine the actual volume of wastes that can be accommodated in the facility.

b. Adequate signage should be placed in the health care waste disposition area.

c. The cell should be lined with a material of low permeability, such as clay or a geo-membrane such as a high-density polyurethane (HDPE) plastic liner to contain the leachate and prevent contamination of groundwater sources within the area.

d. Ensure that adequate soil cover is placed on the cells right after each waste spreading.

e. Basic record keeping of the incoming wastes indicating the time of receipt, volume or weight, source identification (i.e. name of generator or source), certification of treatment (or any similar form indicating that the waste have undergone the necessary treatment) and the general condition of the waste to be disposed.

C.3.2 Sanitary Landfill Facility

1. A Sanitary Landfill Facility (SLF) is a disposal site designed, constructed, operated and maintained in a manner that exerts engineering control over significant potential environmental impacts arising from the development and operation thereof.

2. The required dedicated cells for treated health care wastes should be built or developed prior to its operation to prevent the mixing thereof with municipal solid wastes and other wastes.

3. Aside from the ECC, which is required for such facility, the construction and development of an SLF must conform to RA 9003 and its Implementing Rules and Regulations, particularly Sections 1 and 2, Rule XIV.

4. Existing sanitary landfill with approved ECC for the disposal of municipal solid waste must secure an amendment of their ECC before accepting health care waste for disposal thereat.

C.3.3 Safe Burial on Healthcare Facility Premises

1. Safe burial within the premises of healthcare facilities shall be allowed in remote locations and rural areas where no TSD facilities are available. In such activity of safe burial, the health care facility must ensure that the load or capacity of the on-site burial pit is not exceeded.

2. Chemical treatment or disinfection is required prior to safe burial on hospital premises.

3. The standards for safe burial within the healthcare facility premises shall follow the guidelines specified in the DOH Health Care Waste Management Manual (See Annex "C").

4. Relative to the guidelines provided by the DOH, the operation of safe burial should be in accordance with the minimum requirements for landfill.

C.3.4 Sharps and Syringes Disposal Through Concrete Vault

1. Disposal using concrete vault shall be allowed only as an alternative means of disposal of used sharps and syringes.

2. Concrete vault shall be marked with proper signage: CAUTION: HAZARDOUS WASTE OR SHARPS DISPOSAL AREA - UNAUTHORIZED PERSONS KEEP OUT.

ANNEX "A" - Categories of Health Care Waste

1. General Waste - Comparable to domestic waste, this type of waste does not pose special handling problem or hazard to human health or to the environment. It comes mostly from the administrative and housekeeping functions of health care establishments and may also include waste generated during maintenance of health care premises. General waste should be dealt with by the municipal waste disposal system.

2. Infectious Waste - This type of waste is suspected to contain pathogens (bacteria, viruses, parasites, or fungi) in sufficient concentration or quantity to cause disease in susceptible hosts. This includes:

2.1 Cultures and stocks of infectious agents from laboratory work;
2.2 Waste from surgery and autopsies on patients with infectious diseases (e.g. tissues, materials or equipment that have been in contact with blood or other body fluids);
2.3 Waste from infected patients in isolation wards (e.g. excreta, dressings from infected or surgical wounds, clothes heavily soiled with human blood or other body fluids);
2.4 Waste that has been in contact with infected patients undergoing hemodialysis (e.g. dialysis equipment such as tubing and filters, disposable towels, gowns, aprons, gloves, and laboratory coats);
2.5 Infected animals from laboratories; and
2.6 Any other instruments or materials that have been in contact with infected persons or animals.

3. Pathological Waste - Pathological waste consists of tissues, organs, body parts, human fetus and animal carcasses, blood and body fluids. Within this category, recognizable human or animal body parts are also called anatomical waste. This category should be considered as a subcategory of infectious waste, even though it may also include healthy body parts.

4. Sharps - Include needles, syringes, scalpels, saws, blades, broken glass, infusion sets, knives, nails and any other items that can cause a cut or puncture wounds. Whether or not they are infected, such items are usually considered as highly hazardous health care waste.

5. Pharmaceutical waste - Includes expired, unused, split and contaminated pharmaceutical products, drugs, vaccines, and sera that are no longer required and need to be disposed of appropriately. This category also includes discarded items used in handling of pharmaceuticals such as bottles or boxes with residues, gloves, masks, connecting tubing and drug vials.

6. Genotoxic Waste - Genotoxic waste may include certain cytostatic drugs, vomit, urine, or feces from patients treated with cytostatic drugs, chemicals, and radioactive materials. This type of waste is highly hazardous and may have mutagenic, teratogenic, or carcinogenic properties.

6.1 Harmful cytostatic drugs can be categorized as follows:

6.1.1 Alkylating agents: cause alkylation of DNA nucleotides, which leads to cross-linking and miscoding of the genetic stock;

6.1.2 Anti metabolites: inhibit the biosynthesis of nucleic acids in the cell; mitotic inhibitors: prevent cell replication

6.2 Cytotoxic wastes are generated from several sources and include the following:

6.2.1 Contaminated materials from drug preparation and administration, such as syringes, needles, gauges, vials, packaging; outdated drugs, excess (left over) solutions, and drugs returned from the wards;

6.2.2 Urine, feces, and vomit from patients which may contain potentially hazardous amounts of the administered cytotoxic drugs or of their metabolites and which should be considered genotoxic for at least 48 hours and sometimes up to 1 week after drug administration.

7. Chemical Waste - Chemical waste consists of discarded solid, liquid, and gaseous chemicals, for example from diagnostic and experimental work and from cleaning, housekeeping, and disinfecting procedures. Chemical waste from health care may be hazardous or non-hazardous.

7.1 Chemical waste is considered hazardous if it has at least one of the following properties:

7.1.1 Toxic
7.1.2 Corrosive (e.g. acids of pH &lt;2 and bases of pH &gt;12)
7.1.3 Flammable
7.1.4 Reactive (explosive, water-reactive, shock-sensitive)
7.1.5 Genotoxic (e.g. cytostatic drugs)

7.2 Non-hazardous chemical waste consists of chemicals with none of the above properties, such as sugars, amino acids, and certain organic and inorganic salts.

8. Waste with high content of heavy metals - Wastes with a high heavy-metal content represent a subcategory of hazardous chemical waste, and are usually highly toxic. Mercury wastes are typically generated by spillage from broken clinical equipment (thermometers, blood pressure gauges, etc.). Whenever possible, spilled drops of mercury should be recovered. Residues from dentistry have high mercury content. Cadmium waste comes mainly from discarded batteries. Certain "reinforced wood panels" containing lead is still being used in radiation proofing of X-ray and diagnostic departments. A number of drugs contain arsenic but these are treated here as pharmaceutical waste.

9. Pressurized Containers - Many types of gas are used in health care and are often stored in pressurized cylinders, cartridges, and aerosol cans. Many of these, once empty or of no further use (although they may still contain residues), are reusable, but certain types notably aerosol cans, must be disposed of. Whether inert or potentially harmful; gases in pressurized containers should always be handled with care; containers may explode if incinerated or accidentally punctured.

10. Radioactive Waste - includes disused sealed radiation sources, liquid and gaseous materials contaminated with radioactivity, excreta of patients who underwent radio-nuclide diagnostic and therapeutic applications, paper cups, straws, needles and syringes, test tubes, and tap water washings of such paraphernalia. It is produced as a result of procedures such as in vitro analysis of body tissues and fluids, in vivo organ imaging, tumor localization and treatment, and various clinical studies involving the use of radioisotopes. Radioactive health care wastes generally contain radionucleides with short half-lives, which lose their activity in a shorter time. However, certain radionucleides e.g. C-14 contaminated wastes have much longer half-life, more than a thousand years, which need to be specially managed in a centralized treatment facility for radioactive wastes. The same is required for the management of disused sealed radiation sources used for cancer treatment.

ANNEX "B" - Laguna Lake Development Authority Jurisdiction

The Laguna Lake jurisdiction is limited to the water shed of the Laguna Lake which is consist of the following: Rizal Provinces (13 towns); Laguna Provinces (27 towns); chartered cities of San Pablo, Antipolo, Tagaytay, Tanauan, Calamba, Sta. Rosa; Sto. Tomas and Malvar, Batangas; Silang, Carmona and GMA, Cavite; Lucban, Quezon; Taguig and Pateros, Metro Manila; chartered cities of Pasay, Caloocan, Quezon, Manila, Muntinlupa, Marikina and Pasig.

ANNEX "C" - Guidelines for Safe Burial within Hospital Premises

Safe burial within the hospital premises shall be in accordance with the guidelines specified in the DOH Health Care Waste Management Manual as follows:

1. Access to the disposal site should be restricted to authorized personnel only.

2. The burial site should be lined with a material of low permeability, such as clay or a geo-membrane such as a high-density polyethylene (HDPE) plastic liner at the bottom of the pit to prevent contaminating groundwater and avoid pollution.

3. Only hazardous health care waste should be buried. If general health care waste were also buried on the premises, available space would be quickly filled up.

4. Large quantities (>1 kg) of chemical/pharmaceutical wastes should not be buried.

5. The burial site should be managed as a landfill, with each layer of waste covered with a layer of earth to prevent odor, as well as to prevent proliferation of rodents and insects.

6. Burial site should not be located in flood prone areas.

7. Hospital ground should be secured. (e.g. fenced with warning signs).

8. The location of waste burial pit should be downhill or down-gradient from any nearby wells and about 50 meters away from any water body such as rivers or lakes to prevent contaminating sources of water.

9. Health care facilities should keep a permanent record of the size and location of all their on-site burial pits to prevent construction workers, builders, and others from digging in those areas in the future.

10. The safe burial of waste depends critically on rational operational practices. The bottom of the pit should be at least 1.50 meters higher than the ground water level.

11. It should be noted that safe on-site burial is practicable only for relatively limited period, say 1 to 2 years, and for relatively small quantities of waste, say up to 5 to 10 tons in total. Where these conditions are exceeded, a longer-term solution will be needed.

ANNEX "D" - Procedures for the Safe Burial of Sharps and Syringes through Concrete Vault

The procedures for the safe burial of sharps and syringes through concrete vault shall be in accordance with the guidelines in the DOH Health Care Waste Management Manual as follows:

1. Dig a pit (minimum size of 1 m x 1 m x 1.8 m depth), enough to accommodate sharps and syringes for an estimated period of time without reaching the groundwater level. The site must be isolated and at least 152 meters away from the groundwater supply sources and dwelling units.

2. Construct concrete walls and slabs on the pit. Provide slab with opening or manhole for easy deposition of collected sharps and syringes. The manhole should be extended a few centimeters above the soil surface to overcome infiltration of surface water.

3. Deposit the collected safety boxes filled with used sharps and needles inside the concrete vault.

4. Install a security fence around the site.
