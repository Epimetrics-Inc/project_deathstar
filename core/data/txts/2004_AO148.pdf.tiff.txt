<subject>SUBJECT : Document Tracking Information System (DTIS) Implementing Guidelines</subject>

<body>
I. Rationale

The overarching effect of information and communication technology has permeated to the variegated processes that the government is undertaking.

The need to have a clear picture on the status of governmental activities as palpably manifested on documents it processes gives impetus to the development of tools that would enhance its evidence-based decision capability.

This need is buttressed by administrative and ethical requirements as prescribed in Republic Act 6713 also known as Code of Conduct and Ethical Standards for Public Officials and Employees from which the following provisions are underscored:

"SECTION 5. Duties of Public Officials and Employees...

...(a) Act promptly on letters and requests. - All public officials and employees shall, within fifteen (15) working days from receipt thereof. respond to letters, telegrams or other means of communications sent by the public. The reply must contain the action taken on the request.

...(c) Process documents and papers expeditiously - All official papers and documents must be processed and completed within a reasonable time from the preparation thereof and must contain as far as practicable not more than three (3) signatories therein. In the absence of duly authorized signatories the official next-in-rank or officer in charge shall sign for and in their behalf.

...(e) Make documents accessible to the public. - All public documents must be made accessible to, and readily available for inspection by. the public within reasonable working hours"; and

"SECTION 7. Prohibited Acts and Transactions...

...(c) Disclosure and/or misuse of confidential information. - Public officials and employees shall not use or divulge, confidential or classified information officially known to them by reason of their office and not made available to the public, either:

(1) To further their private interests, or give undue advantage to anyone; or

(2) To prejudice the public interest."

Republic Act No. 8792 also known as the E-Commerce Act of 2000, has provided a framework and legal basis for recognizing electronically transmitted messages and documents and electronic signatures which were particularly reflected on sections 7 and 8 of the said Law.

The Department of Health, through its Information Management Service, has developed its own Document Tracking Information System in order to attain the end-states designed by the requirements.

II. Objectives

The implementing guidelines for the DTIS are created in order to:

1. Actualize the intentions set forth by pertinent laws and statutes relating to the custodial fidelity of documents and the required processing time for actions to be taken on Official Documents;

2. Provide clear procedures and mechanisms on the use of the DTIS;

3. Enhance accountability and transparency by providing a window for
documents processed and timelines for requested action; and

4. Define duties and responsibilities of Officials and Personnel of the
DOH relative to the use of DTIS.

III. Scope

The use of the DTIS shall at the outset include at! Offices and Units of the DOH at the level of Service, Bureau, Program/Project Management Offices within the confines of the DOH Central Office Compound.

Other Services/Bureaus including Centers for Health Development, and DOH Hospitals may use the DTIS provided that minimum requirements are met. The subject Offices must therefore coordinate with IMS for customization of the software to meet each peculiar needs.

All official documents, which are not confidential in nature shall be entered into the DTIS.

IV. Guidelines

1. All Offices within the DOH Central Office Compound shall be required to use theJDTIS in all documents, except for those documents, which are security classified as restricted, confidential or secret.

2. Each Office shall identify a key personnel and an alternate who shall be trained on and be responsible to posting of entries in the DTIS. A corresponding Service/Bureau/Office or Unit Order shall be issued to identify and provide authority to said Personnel. Copy furnished with the said Order will be the DOH Systems Administrator for DTIS who will update the corresponding record and access authority of users.

3. The Head of each Office/Unit shall assume over-all responsibility on the veracity of the content that shall be posted on the DTIS by their assigned Personnel or by the authorized Action Officers themselves. The content of the entries made on the DTIS shall be therefore deemed approved and signed by the concerned Action Officers which may be used for legal purposes in accordance with the appropriate provisions of the Republic Act No. 8792 also known as the "Electronic Commerce Law of 2000,".

4. A DTIS Systems Administrator from the IMS or from any other Office that shall be explicitly identified and an alternate shall be identified by the DOH through a Department Order who shall maintain the DTIS database server, issue access to users at assigned level of security, revise the DTIS library, maintains back-up files, and authenticates audit trails and data content integrity.

5. Each Head of Office/Service/Bureau/Program or Unit shall issue an appropriate Office/Service/Bureau/Program or Unit Order identifying and designating Officials and Personnel who will serve as action officer(s) for every type of document that is processed by that Office. A line of succession, (i.e. at most three action officers, one principal and two alternates), identifying the alternate action officers in case of non-availability of the principal action officer shall likewise be contained in the said order to assure sustained services (See Annex A for Pro-Forma Order).

6. The IMS shall be the principal unit that shall be responsible in maintaining the DTIS and the setting-up of standards for its application in coordination with all Offices. It shall likewise be responsible in providing training and technical assistance to identified personnel and offices in the DOH who will be beneficiaries of the DTIS. All concerns and issues therefore regarding its usage shall be directed to IMS.

7. The Specific procedures that shall be followed on the use of the DTIS are written in the Manual of Operation, which is marked as Annex B and is an integral part of these guidelines.

8. Each Office/Service/Bureau/Program or Unit is directed to harmonize their peculiar document coding system to that provided by DTIS. Likewise the same are directed to still maintain logbooks for Incoming and out-going documents, as back-up mechanism. Albeit, Office/Service/Bureau/Program or Unit may opt not to maintain such logbooks provided that it makes a daily print of Report of records it receives from and forwards to other Offices.

The logbooks for incoming documents shall reflect the following data fields:
a. DTIS System Generated Control No.;
b. Assigned Office Control No.;
c. Source of the document;
d. Date and Time of receipt of documents;
e. The subject matter;
f. Action Requested; and
g. A column where the imprimatur of the receiving personnel is to be reflected.

The logbooks for outgoing documents shall reflect the following data fields:
a. DTIS System Generated Control No.;
b. Assigned Office Control No.;
c. Source of the document;
d. Date and Time of receipt of the forwarded documents;
e. The subject matter;
f. Action Requested, and
g. A column where the imprimatur of the receiving personnel is to be reflected.

9. Routing slips will no longer be required as cover or transmittal documents from one Office (i.e. at the level of Office/Service/Bureau/Program or Unit) to another (inter-office communication), in order to actualize a "paperless environment" and create an atmosphere of "guarded" transparency. However, the key personnel, of each OfficefService/Bureau/Program or Unit, assigned to man the DTIS shall at every transaction document received, advise the Principal Action Officer, which is usually the Head or Deputy (Division Chiefs) of that Office/Service/Bureau/Program or Unit regarding the action requested for such documents. It shall be part of the work ethos and hygiene of the usual Action Officers to verify entries made in the DTIS. In cases where there is power (brown-out) or systems (e.g. proliferation of virus, bog-down of server etc) failure, the usual Action Officers are directed to just verify the entries made in the logbook for both the incoming and outgoing documents to monitor the action requested and the status of the document. Albeit, routing slips may be used to give instructions to personnel within or internal to a specific Office/Service/Bureau/Program or Unit or as an advise note from one subordinate to a superior within an office (intra-office communication).

10. The Records Section of the Information Management Service shall be the central unit that shall be issuing pre-printed barcode stickers, which shall be pasted on Official Documents that are to be released to external parties. The Records Section shall maintain a database file of the barcodes issued to every office. It shall assure that inventory of the barcode stickers is conducted and that supply is at optimum level.

11. Barcodes shall be used by all Office/Service/Bureau/Program or Unit in all official documents that are to be released to external parties, is operationally defined hereon as those outside the compound of the DOH Central Office. The same Office/Service/Bureau/Program or Unit shall be entitled to a barcode reader subject to availability.

12. The use of barcodes shall be applied but will not be limited to the following documents which require the imprimatur of Officials from level of Director and up:

a. Official Response to written inquiries;
b. Official Correspondences addressed to external parties;
c. Press Release Statements;
d. Administrative Issuances requested from the Records Section;
e. Sub-allotments from DOH Central Office to CHD or DOH Hospitals;
