<body>
1. BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE
	Presently, the Philippine Human Resources for Health (HRH) is characterized by shortage of physicians and fast turn-over of health professionals particularly nurses due to migration affecting health care delivery in the country.
Apart from financial gain as a pull factor for Filipino HRH to work abroad opportunities for career growth and career paths are limited in the Philippines

Being the lead agency in health as mandated by Executive Order No. 102 s. 1999, "Redirecting the Functions and Operations of the Department of Health (DOH); the DOH has initiated the development of a strategic framework which provides the policy direction to address the country's worsening issues and concerns on HRH, as described above. This was clearly defined in the current framework for health sector reform the Fourmula One for Health under the four reform areas specifically governance One strategic approach under governance is health human resource development and management The objective is to 1nst1tut1onalize a management system for health human production utilization and placement and development including information system towards developing competent and dedicated HRH to deliver quality health service This strategy will be implemented through the national HRH Program which follows the directions set by the approved Human Resources for Health Master Plan (HRHMP) (Annex 1).

The importance of human resources cannot be overemphasized for effective implementation of any health sector reform agenda. The health systems need to ensure their competencies and commitment to make health reform process a success. With this, the DOH is set to implement the programs under the said plan.
The HRHMP is a 25-year plan providing a conceptual framework and roadmap that will address HRH issues and problems. One of the priority programs under its Phase I - Short Term Plan (2006-2010), is the installation of the competency-based human resources for health management and development (HRHMD) systems. The installation of the HRHMD systems would hopefully respond to motivational issues cited by migrant Filipino HRH, such as, limited career path and career growth as well as lack of training opportunities and job satisfaction in the workplace. Through the installation of the HRHMD systems, it is envisioned that the country will have an adequate, competent and well-motivated HRH to deliver quality health service. This order provides the guidelines, systems and procedures to ensure the effective and efficient implementation of the HRHMD system both at the national and local levels.

ll. OBJECTIVE

V. Policies and Guidelines

A. The HRH Framework in support to F1
The HRH framework is hereby established and adopted, which shall serve as one of the key strategies for developing competent and dedicated HRH to deliver quality health service in the country. As such, a substantial amount of time and resources shall be devoted to harness the intellectual capital of the DOH workforce, including the LGU and other partners. It is the skills and training of the employees that will lead to the effective and efficient implementation of the health sector reform/F1.

The HRH framework (Annex 2) starts with each organization (eg. DOH, LGU,
PHIC, etc.) having a well-defined vision, mission, goals, objectives, strategies, values and mandate. Depending on the nature of the organization, it is composed of different units with each unit harmoniously working together based on their roles and functions in order to attain the organization’s vision, mission and goals (VMG).
Each office/unit within an organization is composed of employees with defined set of competencies designed for their job/position.

Since the organization is composed of employees or human resource (HR), every organization should ensure that all aspects of HR such as production and planning, utilization and placement and development are given the necessary attention and well taken care of by the organization. In order to achieve effectiveness and efficiency in these three HR aspects, installation and implementation of HRHMD systems should be adopted by any organization. The middle figure in the framework shows the different HRHMD systems.

These HRHMD systems are competency-based meaning each system takes into consideration the competencies required by the organization from its HR. The competency-based HRHMD systems support human resource management and development in the organization and ensure that the career of each employee is properly managed from the time of his/her entry into the organization up to his/her exit or retirement. Thus the installation and implementation of these systems will lead to a well-motivated and satisfied HR that will support the achievement of the organization’s VMG.

B. Competency-Based Human Resources for Health Management and
Development Systems
The critical element of the competency-based HRHMD system is a well-defined set of competencies required from each employee in order to attain the organization’s VMG. This set of competencies is the foundation of all the HRHMD systems in its implementation and has been identified in the competency based job description manuals for the health facilities namely, DOH-CO, CHDs, DOH Hospitals, LGU field offices (provincial/city/municipal health office) and LGU hospitals. The following are the brief description of the different HRHMD systems:

1. Human Resource Planning (HRP) System
This system is designed to determine the human resource requirement and the competencies each employee should possess and demonstrate anchored with the organization’s VMG and mandate in order to meet its thrusts, strategies and goals.

2. Job Related Recruitment and Selection (JRRS) System 
This system is designed to ensure that the organization employs the right person with the appropriate competencies for the job/position to be filled. The JRRS also provides a clear picture of the job requirement, increases the likelihood of hiring the right person for the job and in turn, minimizes investment in hiring an employee who may not meet the expectations of the organization. Interview and reference-check questions are structured to assess behavior, knowledge and skills of the applicant in relation to the competency required for the vacant job/position.

3. Performance Management System (PMS)
This system is designed to enable the supervisor and supervisee to agree on the appropriate levels of performance for each competency and identify any training or development needed to achieve those levels. The supervisor provides coaching and counseling throughout the performance cycle to support competency development of their subordinate. Performance feedback is provided throughout the performance cycle. The semi-annual assessment also includes a review of actual performance in each competency.
4. A Training & Development Needs Analysis (TDNA)

This system is designed to come up with a rational training and development plan for all human resource of the organization. It enables the manager/supervisor to focus on the skills, knowledge and behavior of the staff that have the most impact on job effectiveness and efficiency. It also ensures that formal training programs, on-the-job training, and developmental assignments are used depending on competency development needs and are aligned with the organizational values and strategies

5. Career Development and Management System (CDMS)

This is a system that ensures the conscious effort to plan, organize and administer the employees’ career over their professional life within the organization using the competency proficiency assessment tool. It relates the employee’s individual career plans and direction to the organization's requirements. It is composed of the following subsystems:

a. Individual Career Planning (ICP) - it is the process of matching the employees’ current and fore-seeable career needs with the options available to them and re-evaluating their plans as necessary. It is the planning and managing of the employees’ career over their lifetime.

b. Career Pathing I Charting (CP/C) - it allows the employees to align their professional or career path with that of the organization by determining both training and non-training support mechanisms that will assist them in achieving their professional goals.

c. Succession Planning (SP) - it will determine the ways in which the organization specifically develops managers for their future needs based on key/critical positions, core competency requirements and training and development plan.

d. Retention Planning (RP) - it is designed to prevent voluntary separation by high job performers and promote job satisfaction and high productivity among the workforce.

C. Key Strategies
To ensure the proper installation and implementation of the HRHMD
systems, the following strategies and activities should be done:
1. Orientation and training of key implementers [Bureau/Service/
Center/Center for Health Development (CHD) Directors, Division Chiefs,
Supervisors, Administrative Officers (AOs), Human Resource Management Officers (HRMOs)] on the concepts, procedures, processes and tools of the
HRHMD systems.

a. The Health Human Resource Development Bureau (HHRDB) will be in
charge of the orientation and training of key implementers at the CO and
building the capacity of the CHD through the Human Resource
Development Unit (HRDU)/Personnel/Administrative unit to facilitate

implementation and installation of the systems.

b. The CHD through the HRDU will be responsible for the orientation and
training of key implementers at the CHD and DOH hospitals of their
respective regions

c. For the Job-Related Recruitment and Selection Systems, the Selection
Board of the 1St and 2nd level positions, Selection Board of the 3rd level
positions and the Personnel Division will be trained by the HHRDB on
targeted selection.

2. Creation of a team that will conduct advocacy and buy-in to ensure the
installation of HRHMD systems at the LGU level. The composition of the team
will include senior technical staff from HHRDB, Bureau of Local health
Development (BLHD) and CHD (HHRDU & Local Health Assistance Division or
LHAD)

3. Provision of technical assistance through coaching and mentoring to ensure
effective and efficient systems installation and implementation.

4. Development of monitoring scheme and tools to assess progress of systems
installation and implementation.

ANNEX 1
Health Human Resource Development Master Plan
2005-2030
Executive Summary
In the human resources for health (HRH) arena, the quality of health services provided
depends on the quality of human resources delivering health care. The quality of human
resources must be carefully safe guarded through appropriate production and supply,
equitable distribution and mobilization and strategic utilization in order to meet health
system goals.
The process and outcome evaluation sought to analyze existing national interrelated
health human resource management and development (HRMD) systems in the public
and private sectors and develop a Human Resource Master Plan for the Health Sector
utilizing three planning frames: 2005-2010 - Short term plan; 2011-2021- Medium
term plan; and 2022-2030- Long term plan.
Methods utilized in this project included stakeholder analysis, situational analysis,
process and outcome evaluation, scenario building and forecasting, and consensus
building through the conduct of two round table discussions. Quantitative and qualitative
analysis of available information was accomplished to set key result areas and strategic
thrusts for specific defined periods. The
forecasting component utilized a WHO commissioned workforce planning software
crafted by Dr. Carol Gaston and specifically for nursing workforce planning. Owing to
the inadequacy of available data, assumptions were crafted based on available
empirical information and proxy data. The format and the process of log frame analysis
were used to generate the operational plans so that DOH can easily transform the plan
into funding proposals.
The situational analysis of this plan was based on the previous work done on HRH. A
total of 49 records and policies were reviewed for the analysis. A survey was done to
gather local government unit HRH data and to describe the three-year attrition rates in
selected DOH hospitals. Primary data were retrieved through the conduct of focus
group discussions and regional consultations in the Visayas and Mindanao regions.
The guiding philosophy, goals, directions, and objectives of the HRH Master Plan were
adopted from the work of Hornby and Ozcan for Malawi. Objectives of the plan included
the provision of direction for Philippine HR development in three frames, determination
of HRD objectives, key strategies, activities and evaluation indicators for the above
mentioned time frames; and identification of short term, medium term and long-term
actions, including policy and program actions that are needed for DOH to proceed to
medium term and long-term.
Current Initiatives and other related considerations integrated into the Master Plan
included the current health program initiatives such as devolution, Health Sector Reform
Agenda (HSRA) and establishment of inter-local health zones; health needs, socio-
demographic trends; and regulatory standards. Assumptions included were
implementation of HSRA until 2020; workforce plans based on population, service, and
regulatory requirements; National Objectives for Health and Medium Term Development
Plan; and feasible phased HRHD planning.
Eleven HHR categories were planned for the first phase of the Master Plan and twelve
for the second phase.
The 25 year strategic plan was developed in three phases with corresponding plan
components:
A. Phase 1 - Short term plan for 2005-2010 that will focus on:
o workforce planning implementation (redistribution and rationalization of
health workers),
management of HRH domestic deployment and international migration
and
institutionalization of HRH Management Units;
B. Phase 2 - Medium term plan for 2011-2020 that will emphasize the need to
Institutionalize HRH Retention Schemes,
Encourage public-private partnerships in increasing investments for health
and health related purposes,
0 Generate critical HR information, and
0 Establish quality management systems for HRH;
C. Phase 3 - Long term plan for 2021-2030 that will ensure that:
0 Functional HRH management systems are in place to ensure productive
and satisfied workforce
Results of the monitoring and evaluation of the master plan are used to
refine established HRH systems and transition into next HRH plan.
