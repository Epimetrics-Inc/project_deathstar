<subject>SUBJECT: Implementing Guidelines on Classification of Patients and on Availment of Medical Social Services in Government Hospitals.</subject>


<body>

I. POLICY BASIS AND RATIONALE :

This policy issuance is one of the responses of the DOH to the need for people-centered hospitals that are responsive to the demands of the present socio—economic situation in which most Filipinos ﬁnd themselves. Based on the latest statistical data gathered from all regions, the National Statistics and Coordinating Board (NSCB), has described the poverty situation as follows: In 2000:

(a) The Poverty Incidence [proportion of families to the total number of families] stood at 34.2 %,

(b) The Magnitude of Poor Families [number of families whose annual per capita income falls below the annual per capita poverty threshold] was 5,215,989;

(c) The Per Capita Poverty Thresholds [annual per capita income required...to satisfy essential nutritional requirements (2,000 calories) and other basic needs] ranged from P10, 868 for Region VIII to P18, 001 for NCR and averaged P13, 916 for the whole Philippines; and

Addressing the poverty situation by means of providing accessible and affordable health care services, especially public hospital services, constitutes the main rationale for this Order.
