Pursuant to this Act, the Implementing Rules and Regulations have been promulgated to adapt to the changes and developments in the epidemiology of infectious diseases and the phenomenon of globalization, which have altered the traditional distinction between national and international health.

2. OBJECTIVES

a. To define the standards and requisites for quarantine operations involving both international and domestic interests.

b. To provide an effective tool in strengthening disease surveillance, prevention and control,

c. To outline measures to respond pro-actively to public health emergencies of international concern (PHEIC) through an effective entry-exit management in ports and airports of entry for conveyances, people and goods.

These are designed to harmonize the protection of public health with minimal interference in world trade and travel and shall apply to all vessels, aircraft, their crew and passengers, cargoes, whether owned by government or private entities, that enter and depart from seaport or airport within the Philippines.

3. SCOPE/ COVERAGE

These regulations shall apply to all vessels, aircraft's, their crew or passengers and cargoes, whether owned by government or private entities, that shall enter and depart from seaport or airport within the territory of the Philippines.

4. REGULATORY AUTHORITY

The Bureau of Quarantine of the Department of Health shall exercise the regulatory functions as the health authority in seaports and airports of entry as the area or responsibility under these Implementing Rules and Regulations.

5. POLICIES AND GUIDELINES

1) Subject to these rules and regulations are intervention strategies necessary to address the mandate of providing maximum security against the introduction and spread of infectious diseases in the county. In these strategies, the bureau:

■ Conducts surveillance and institutes infection control measures to prevent the entry and spread of infectious diseases through effective entry-exit management at seaports and airports of entry.

■ Provides technical assistance and supervision, consulting and advisory services on health and sanitation programs in the area of responsibility

■ Conducts medical examinations of aliens/foreigners for immigration purposes

■ Provides vaccination requirements for international travel

■ Ensures the maintenance of sanitary environment through close supervision and control of food safety and sanitation facilities at the catering points, food service establishments and inter-island vessels at the area of responsibility.

2) The bureau is authorized to use at least fifty (50%) percent of the income generated subject to accounting and auditing rules and regulations to substantially support the various quarantine operations in light of the modernization program in addressing the change of trends due to globalization and volume of travel and trade.

3) The bureau is mandated to provide stiffer penalties to violations in the provisions of the Implementing Rules and Regulations to avoid breaches in public health security.

6. SEPARABILITY CLAUSE

PREFACE

The Implementing Rules and Regulations, of Quarantine Act of 2004 (R.A. 9271) which has been enacted by the twelfth (12th) Congress of the Republic of the Philippines, serve as a revised and updated version of the IRR of the Quarantine Law of 1947 (R.A. 123). This includes the implementation of the International Health Regulations (IHR) of the World Health Organization (WHO) in which the country is bound to observe and implement as a member state of said organization.

The Bureau of Quarantine, being the health authority, is mandated to ensure security against the introduction and spread of infectious diseases to include the emerging diseases and public health emergencies of international concern. This include a pro-active response to public health concerns on matters pertaining to food safety, sanitation and vector control in airports and seaports of entry on conveyances, people, goods and cargoes.

The updated regulations are devised to respond to the epidemiological changes and continuing global trends which markedly have an impact on disease surveillance, prevention and control. The promotion of these health regulations are balanced by an equal concern on the minimal interference with travel and trade and to meet the standards and requisites for quarantine operations involving both the international and domestic interests.
