<subject>SUBJECT : Implementing Guidelines for the Department of Health (DOH) Medicines Access Program for Early Stage Breast Cancer (Stage I-IIIa) </subject>


<body>
I. RATIONALE 

Pursuant to Republic Act 9502, otherwise known as the Universally Accessible Quality and Cheaper Medicines Act of 2008 mandating the Department-of Health (DOH) to increase access to essential medicines for the country’s priority diseases, the National Center for Pharmaceutical Access and Management UNCPAM) of the Department of Health is now pursuing a free medicines access program for vulnerable and special populations affected by diseases which cause a signiﬁcant health and economic burden 1n the country. 

Cancer is'now the third 1e ading cause of mortality in the Philippines claiming thousands of lives every year. It is considered a catastrophic disease owing to its impact . to health, productivity and overall quality of life and the high cost of therapy that causes impoverishment of patients and their families. Based on the latest data from the Philippine Cancer Registry, breast cancer is now the top site of malignancy affecting mostly women in their most productive years of life. Thus far, at least 10,000 breast cancer cases are being reported annually in the Philippines with a mortality rate of about 40% (Philippine Cancer Facts and Statistics 2010). 

Thus, to help improve the cure and survival rates of cancer patients and alleviate their ﬁnancial hardships in paying for costly cancer treatment, DOH will target the most cost-effective and commonly used adjuvant chemotherapy for Stage I-llla breast cancer in women. The free medicines access program for Cancer is not only meant to provide ready access to anti-cancer drugs but to promote early—screening and cancer awareness among Filipinos emphasizing that detecting, treating and managing cancer in the early stages improves the overall prognosis and survival rates for patients.

ANNEX B 

TREATMENT PROTOCOL FOR EARLY STAGE BREAST CANCER 

TREATMENT PROTOCOL FOR EARLY STAGE BREAST CANCER (Tl-3, N04, M0) (Developed for the Pilot Implementation of the Patient Navigation Program / Medicines Access Program 1n Four Government Hospitals) 

Philippine Cancer Society, Inc.,* Philippine Society for Medical Oncology * Philippine College of Surgeons* Philippine Society of Pathologists 

I. Background: 

According to the 2010 Philippine Cancer Facts and Estimates, in 2010 breast cancer will be the leading cancer site in the Philippines for both sexes combined (15%), and the leading cancer among women (28%). An estimated 12,262 new casesand 4,371 deaths from breast cancer will occur in 2010. The incidence rate has been steadily rising since 1980, with an average annual percentage change of 0.9%. Incidence is expected to continue to increase with increasing unhealthy. lifestyles — cigarette smoking/second hand smoke; unhealthy diet/overweight/Obesity; decreased physical activity; and increasing alcohol consumption. Decreased fertility will be a major cause of increasing incidence. 

Fortunately, breast cancer is one of the most curable of cancers and curability increases with earlier detection. However, 5-year relative survival among Filipino women is still unacceptably low compared to women in North America, Western Europe and some Asian countries. In the Philippines, lack of awareness may not be the major reason why majority Of breast cancers are not diagnosed and treated early. Inability of most patients to afford the direct and indirect costs of treatment, as well as related socioeconomic impediments, may well be the major barriers to be overcome. A recent study showed that around 80% Of women with clinically detected breast lumps will have the mass biopsied if they were assured that shouldthe mass turn out to be breast cancer, treatment will be free. 

The primary curative treatment for breast cancer is surgery — modiﬁed radical mastectomy, or breast conserving breast surgery plus radiotherapy if the patient so desires and in situations where this is feasible. With surgery alone, overall lO-year survival among women with no spread to the axillary lymph nodes in developed countries had been reported to be around 70%. In the Philippines, modiﬁed radical mastectomy can be'performed in every province. Community-based programs on early detection and treatment should be primarily concerned with getting women with breast cancer to undergo mastectomy as early as possible. In certain situations, and particularly when there is spread to the axillary lymph nodes, adjuvant systemic treatment may increase the probability of survival. 

There ought to be a comprehensive and integrated effort that is doable and sustainable at both national and local levels, involving the public and private sectors, professional health organizations, social and private insurance providers, NGOs and charitable institutions. The Department of Health (DOH) aims to jump start this effort by formulating a standard National Treatment Protocol. for breast cancer, provide free hormone receptor testing and free adjuvant systemic therapy drugs for eligible indigent patients provided by the National Center for Pharmaceutical Access and Management (NCPAM) of the DOH, and provide a Patient Navigation System in cooperation with the Philippine Cancer Society. The Protocol will be pilot tested in 4 Of the biggest public hospitals in Metro Manila and Rizal Province, where there are 2 established population-based cancer registries that will monitor outcomes. 

The Protocol was developed following consultation with a multidisciplinary team Of experts in cancer management as well as clinicians from the four pilot government hospitals of this Program; Professional medical organizations comprising Of the Philippine Cancer Society, Inc (PCSI), Philippine College” Of Surgeons (PCS), Philippine Society of Medical Oncology (PSMO) and the Philippine Society of Pathologists (PSP) were involved‘ in the review of existing international and local literature and clinical guidelines on breast cancer management and in drawing recommendations based on the best evidence, current practice, the cost- effectiVeness of the interventions and their adaptability and appropriateness Of use in the local healthcare setting. 

While the DOH-NCPAM free adjuvant systemic treatment for indigent patients will initially include four government hospitals in Metro Manila, it is intended that the Program will eventually include other regions and that the DOH Breast Cancer Treatment Protocol be implemented in all public hospitals. 

II. General Aspects of Care 

1. Earlier Detection, better outcomes. Generally, breast cancer is diagnosed late in the Philippines owing to many factors such as economic barriers, fear and lack of awareness, inadequate access to screening services and low percentage of women doing breast self-examination (B SE). It needs to be emphasized that breast cancer is a highly curable disease when it is detected, treated and managed early. 

In High Income Countries, , it has been shown that mammographic screening, combined with physician breast examination, increased survival among women 50 years Old and older. However, the WHO does not recommend mammography as a population—based screening method in developing countries because of the prohibitive cost. Nevertheless, Women 50 years and Older are encouraged to undergo annual mammography on their own. The provision of sociO-economic assistance to needy women could be the major incentive for early detection, as most of them had detected their breast mass but had delayed medical consultation because of sociO-economic barriers. 

2. Reducing barriers in the health care system. Even when sociO-economic support may be available from public or private sources majority of women will be unable to avail of such Opportunities on their own. They will need the help of an established Patient Navigation System that will assist them overcome the myriad socio- economic and institutional obstacles that stand in the way of early detection, diagnosis, treatment and follow up. 

This DOH-PCSI Program builds on successful initiatives of patient navigation for minority populations in the US which began in the 1990’s. The aim is to ensure the efﬁcient delivery Of- services to the cancer patient in a 'seamless and coordinated manner while addressing social, economic, and logistical barriers in the healthcare system. 

3. Equity, accessibility, aﬂordabilitv and sustainability. Early detection, diagnosis and treatment methods should be evidence—based and community-oriented. Since the' intent of the Department of Health (DOH) is to make relevant services accessible to the largest number of women possible nationwide, particularly the needy, comparative coSt-effectiveness and sustainability is of paramount consideration. 

4. Treatment Protocols. Treatment protocols will be evidence-based and community oriented. Such protocols are usually based on existing Clinical Practice Guidelines that are recognized by the DOH. Protocols may also be formulated de novo in the absence of acceptable Clinical Practice Guidelines. 

5. Guidelines/Protocols Review. Guidelines/Protocols implementation will be closely monitored. There will be a cOntinuing and timely review mechanism, and changes/modiﬁcations made based on implementation results and/or the availability of new relevant scientiﬁc information. 

6. Social Insurance. DOH treatment protocols will be the basis for the expansion Of the national coverage of ' social insurance (PhilHealth), particularly on speciﬁc catastrophic illnesses that have a major adverse impact on national development. 

7. Informed decision-making. Every patient will decide for herself. It is thus a requisite that each individual patient be given sufﬁcient and truthful information about her particular situation and the different therapeutic options and support services. This should emphasize the potential beneﬁts and potential risks of harmful effects Of the different treatment options. 

8. Multidisciplinary approach. The management Of breast cancer must be multi- disciplinary and interdisciplinary involving a breast surgeon, a medical oncologist, pathologist and/or a radiation oncologist and a nurse. The Treatment Protocol should be based on scientiﬁc evidence provided by many disciplines and formulated on the Objective appraisal Of such evidence. Elements of turf and personal biases should have no place in the formulation and implementation of a national Treatment Protocol. Patient and national interest should be the primary concerns. 

9. Early Breast Cancer. In women with early breast cancer, all detectable cancer, is by deﬁnition, restricted to the breast and in the case of node positive patients, the local lymph nodes can be removed surgically. These would correspond to TNM Stages I to IIIA- For this speciﬁc program, early stage breast cancer shall include tumors classiﬁed under Stage I—IIIa speciﬁcally breast tumors more than 5 cm in greatest dimension with no extension to the chest wall or skin; with ipsilateral axillary node involvement that is not matted or ﬁxed to other structures, and no metastasis (Tl-3, NO-l, M0). 

III. Types of Breast Cancer 

The nomenclature of breast cancer follows the WHO Histological ClaSsiﬁcatiOn Of Tumours Of the Breast (2003) 

Majority. Of breast cancer are invasive ductal carcinoma. types are: noninvasive (intraductal and lobular), invasive, and Paget’s disease of the nipple. ' speciﬁed. Other histopathologic ﬁndings that correlate with poor prognosis are low nuclear grade and presence of tubule formation. 

For treatment purposes, breast cancer may be divided into: 
a. Pure noninvasive carcinoma (Stage 0) 
i. ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS; Stage 0) 
ii. lobular carcinoma in situ (LCIS) 

b. Operable locoregional 1nvasive carcinoma (Stage I, II and some stage IIIA) 

c. Inoperable locoregional 1nvasive carcinoma (Stage IIIB, IIIC and some stage ‘IIIA tumors) 

d. Metastatic or recurrent carcinoma (Stage IV) 


IV. Clinical Assessment, Diagnosis and Pre-operative Work-up 

In the Philippines, most breast cancers are found by self-breast examination (SBE) done by the patient. Women with palpable tumors and other signs and symptoms of malignancy should undergo clinical breast examination (CBE) done by the physician or a trained health worker (i.e. nurse, midwife) and referred to higher level of care for further evaluation and management. 

As a minimum baseline, the following investigations should be done for preoperative assessment of early stage breast cancer. The use Of diagnostic tests for preoperative and metastatic work~up should be symptom-directed. 

History 
- Symptom/chief complaint 
- Past Medical History 
- Family Medical History — emphasis on breast and other gynecological cancers 
- Reproductive history -- age at menarche, age at ﬁrst delivery, number of pregnancies/livebirths/miscarriages; history of contraceptive use (type and duration), hormone replacement therapy 

Physical exam (PE) 
- general system check-up 
- weight, height 
- breast examination — breast mass, skin changes, breast discharge, nipple changes, lymph node status (i.e. axillary, supraclav'icular) 

Laboratory examination 
- Chest radiography 
- Blood exams. CBC with differential, liver function, kidney function, alkaline phosphatase 
- Abdominal ultrasound or Liver ultrasound 
- ECG  for patients with history and signs and symptoms of angina, CHF, coronary heart disease or any other cardiac disease 

The use of diagnostic tests for preoperative metastatic work up should be symptom- -directed as there 1s no evidence that they increase survival especially among asymptomatic women with early Operable breast cancer. 

Mammography, sonography and other breast imaging studies do not improve the accuraCy of arriving at an accurate preoperative diagnosis and should not be used routinely in patients with a palpable breast mass which is clinically suspected to' be malignant. However, preoperative mammography is recommended to detect subclinical disease in the 'contralateral breast, and also , in the ipsilateral breast for those patients who will undergo breast conservation treatment. 

Core Needle Biopsy 

In all patients with a palpable breast mass in which cancer is suspected, biopsy is mandatory. Core needle biOpsy (CNB) is highly recommended, as there will be no need for an experienced cytopathologist and enough specimen can be obtained to perform immunohistochemical (IHC) hormone receptor assay (HRA) (estrogen/progesterone). IHC hormone receptor assay done on mastectomy specimens have a higher risk of false-negative results since it is more difﬁcult to rapidly and adequately fix mastectomy specimens compared to CNB specimens. The CNB specimen should be immediately ﬁxed in 10% neutral buffered formalin (NBF). 

Hormone Receptor Assay 

Determination Of estrogen and progesterone receptor status (ER/PR status) should be done in all breast cancer patients to know the subset of patients who will beneﬁt from systemic hormone therapy. 

All specimens for IHC—HRA shall be sent to the National Kidney and Transplant Institute (N KTI) and other laboratories accredited by the DOH which have passed and complied with the proﬁciency testing for this assay based on set national standards and compliance monitoring done by the NKTI as the National Reference Laboratory for Hematology, Immunohematology,Immunopathologv andAnatomic Pathology for Renal- Diseases and other unassigned organ system diseases. The national standards should include strategies aimed at ensuring Optimal performance, interpretation and reporting of assays, based on the American Society of Clinical Oncology / College of American Pathologists 2010 Guideline Recommendations. These standards shall be developed by the DOH/NKTI in cooperation and consultation with relevant professional medical societies, hospitals and laboratories. 

HER-2 Receptor Assay 

The overexpression of HER-2-neu in invasive breast cancers (20%) denotes aggressiveness Of the tumor as well as resistance and responsiveness to hormone treatment. and certain chemotherapy drugs. Testing Of HER2 receptor status by IHC or FISH should be offered as an option for all patients but is not recommended for routine use since targeted anti— HER2 therapy IS out—Of reach for most Filipino patients and IS not cost-effective given its prohibitive cost in the Philippines. 

V. Staging and Clinical Diagnosis
Staging and tumor assessment should follow the TNM staging classiﬁcation system which considers three main factors namely, primary tumor size, lymph node involvement and presence of metastasis. CliniCal staging should be used to guide the choice of treatment according to the extent Of spread of the malignancy. 

VI. Surgery for Early Stage Breast Cancer 

The purpose Of surgery is to remove the local and regional disease. The primary treatment of early breast cancer is either modiﬁed radical mastectomy (MRM) or breast conserving surgery plus radiotherapy. Breast conserving surgery should include complete excision of the primary tumor’in the breast and an axillary dissection to determine nodal status. It is the patient whowill make the informed choice. More extensive surgery is done in order to remove all gross tumor. Surgery should be performed not later than one month after tissue diagnosis. ' 

Histopathology Reports 

The histOpathology report On the modiﬁed radical mastectomy specimen, or the breast conserving surgery specimen, should conform to the PSP Consensus Guidelines for the Standardization oinsto'pathologic Reporting of Breast Carcinoma 2008. The report should include the following information: 

1) Type Of surgical procedure done 

2) Number, size, site and laterality Of the tumor 

3) Histo'logic type and the Nottingham histologic grade of the tumor 

4) Extent of lymphovascular invasion, if present 

5) Status of surgical margins 

6) Lymph node status including the number Of positive lymph nodes removed and the extent of metastasis 

7) AJCC pathologic staging 

8) Immunohistochemical ER/PR status 

9) Her2/neu expression, if done 

VII. In Situ Carcinoma 

The goal of treatment Of in-situ carcinoma is either preventing the occurrence of invasive disease or diagnosing the invasive component when still localized to the breast. 

Observation alone is the preferred Option for women diagnosed with lobular carcinoma-in- situ (LCIS) because their risk of developing invasive carcinoma is low. Bilateral mastectomy may be considered in special circumstances. 

Tamoxifen treatment may be considered in women with estrogen receptor-positive [ER(+)] ductal carcinoma—in-situ (DCIS) treated with breast conserving therapy or with mastectomy (PSMO, PCSI, 2010). 

VIII. Radiotherapy 

Adjuvant radiotherapy following modiﬁed radical mastectomy does not improve survival in all cases of early breast cancer and should not be routinely given. However, it is an integral part of breast conserving surgery (BCS) for the preserved tissue for early breast cancer. 

When the histOpathology report mentions the presence of tumor cells in the margins of the specimen, re—excision Of the involved area is recommended, rather than relying on radiotherapy to control locoregional disease. Needless to say, good patient selection as well as sound surgical technique is of paramount importance in preventing locoregional recurrence. ' - 

Patients whose primary tumor is greater than 5 cm, .Or with 4 or more positive axillary. nodes, may beneﬁt from adjuvant radiotherapy. Local recurrence could be decreased, and in patients with a low potential for distant metastases, survival beneﬁts may also be derived. 

Patients with a high risk of systemic recurrence, such as those with Grade 3 tumors and/or with extensive perivascular tumor invasion, may derive more beneﬁt from aggressive systemic therapy rather than on focusing resources on locoregional control. 

IX. Adjuvant Systemic Treatment 

Adjuvant systemic treatment consists of hormone therapy for ER positive tumors and cytotoxic chemotherapy to eradicate remaining cancer cells following surgery to reduce the risk of relapse and metastasis. ‘ 

Hormone receptor status as well as axillary nodal status, are the major variables that determine the probability Of beneﬁt, or lack Of probable beneﬁt, as well as the type of adjuvant systemic treatment that may be of beneﬁt. It is also important to consider the age of the patient and her menstrual status. Large randomized clinical trials (RCTs) as well as meta- analyses Of such RCTs have consistently demonstrated the signiﬁcant importance of these variables. The most important outcomes are those relating to survival. 

There are other variables which were identiﬁed from post-hoe (subset) analysis of the data from RCTs, and although the evidence for the predictability Of the effects Of the presence of these variables (particularly in association with speciﬁc adjuvant treatments) are weaker compared to the four mentioned above, they are currently recommended by many groups, including the St Galen Panel. These variables include: 

- Grade 3 histological grade 18 
- Presence of extensive perivascular tumor invasion (PVI) 
- 4 or &gt axillary lymph nodes 
- primary tumor size &gt 5 cm; and, 0 age &lt 35 years 
- ER/PR negative 
- Her-2/neu overexpression 

Patients with these variables are said to comprise a “high-risk group”, and, among cases with hormone receptor-negative tumors ought to have “second line” combination cytotoxic chemotherapy ”drugs, or, among cases with hormone receptor-positive tumors should receive cytotoxic chemotherapy added to hormone therapy. 

Nevertheless, because of accumulating evidence from the results of multigene array studies, the St Gallen' 2009 Panel had radically modified their previous recommendations. Multigene arrays have shown that there might have been many patients with hormone responsive tumors that were overtreated with chemotherapy. Regarding aah uvant cytotoxic chemotherapy in general - “There is a lack of specific predictor markers for response to individual chemotherapeutic agents. Many diﬂerent regimens are used and no clear indications for a particular regimen exists 

The St Gallen 2009 Panel also “recognized that adherence to therapeutic guidelines is aﬂected by aﬂordability of certain genetic and imaging tests and the costs of some systemic therapies in various geographic settings”. 

Hormone Therapy 

Hormone receptor status, particularly estrogen receptOr status, is the main consideration used in selecting the type of adjuvant systemic treatment. PgR.positive but ER negative tumors may be arti'factual and can be considered as hormone responsive tumors. Endocrine responsiveness is deﬁned as the presence of any detectable estrogen receptor (ER). 

Fresh surgical breast mass specimen must be routinely taken at ﬁrst surgery for estrogen receptor/ progesterone receptor (ER/PR) assay. 

Cytotonic chemotherapy 

For chemotherapy, the highest incremental survival beneﬁts are derived for patients With hormone receptor negative tumors, premenopausal women with node-positive disease (Stage II- 111a) and those with unfavourable prognostic factors that point to a high risk for recurrence. ' 

Currently, acceptable treatment regimens include classical CMF, anthracycline-based therapies and taxane-based therapies. Trastuzumab in combination with taxanes have been found to improve breast cancer outcomes for HER-2 positive breast cancer but is cost- prohibitive and is not cost-effective in resource—limited settings.

‘TO Obtain Optimal treatment outcomes for each individual patient, the choice of adjuvant therapy must be judiciously tailored according to the presence of high-risk factors, the potential beneﬁts and toxic effects of chemotherapy, patient factors such as age and co-I morbidities and the impact of chemotherapy on the patient’s quality of life. Decisions on choosing the best chemotherapeutic option must be fully discussed with the patient. 

Adjuvant chemotherapy should be given within four to six weeks after the completion of surgery or until the surgical wound has completely healed. The medical oncologist should explain the risks and beneﬁts of chemotherapeutic Options to the patient and manage the chemotherapy-induced toxicities that may arise during treatment, which include nausea and vomiting, alopecia, cardiotoxicity (i.e. particularly with doxorubicin) and febrile neutropenia (i.e. with taxane-based therapies). - 

Neoadjuvant Systemic Therapy 

Neoadjuvant systemic therapy, either using cytotoxic chemotherapy, endocrine therapy, or both, is to be givenonly when there is a reasonable chance that the anticipated decrease in primary tumor size will increase the feasibility of breast conserving surgery. This assumes that this is the informed choice Of the patient who had been informed sufﬁciently of the additional costs Of breast conserving surgery. 

Use of Bisphosphonates 

Bisphosphonates should not be routinely given to women with normal bone health and who are receiving adj uvant endocrine therapy 

1. Estrogen Receptor Positive Cases 

Adjuvant endocrine therapy should be considered for all patients with endocrine respOnsive tumors regardless of patient age, menstrual status, lymph node status, Her2 status and whether or not adjuvant cytotoxic chemotherapy is to be given. Tamoxifen can be given orally at 20 mg dose for a period Of ﬁve years. 

'For premenopausal women, ovarian ablation plus tamoxifen (20 mg daily for at least 5 years) Is the preferred treatment. If ovarian ablation (surgical, radiologic, or medical) cannot be performed, tamoxifen alone IS acceptable. 

For postmenopausal women, adjuvant tamoxifen (20 mg daily for at least 5 years) is the recommended treatment. 

The addition of adjuvant cytotoxic chemotherapy to adjuvant endocrine therapy may derive a clinically favorable risk/beneﬁt outcome in women who have unfavorable prognostic features mentioned above. The choice of chemotherapy includes anthracycline-based regimens and classical CMF which should be tailored to the preference, age and general health status of the patient. 

In women with one of the high-risk factors mentioned above, the use of CW chemotherapy may be beneﬁcial. 

In women’with two or more of the high risk factors, the addition of an anthracycline containing chemotherapy combination may provide improved survival outcomes. Among these high-risk women, tamoxifen should be started after the completion of chemotherapy preferably three weeks after Day 1 Of last cycle 

2. Estrogen Receptor Negative Cases 

For cases whose tumors were determined to be estrogen receptor negative in a DOH- accredited laboratory, adjuvant cytotoxic chemotherapy may be beneﬁcial, regardless Of age and menstrual status. Patients with node-positive disease (Stage II-IIIa) should also be recommended to have adj uvant systemic chemotherapy. 

For cases whose primary tumor size is small (&lt 2 cm), with negative axillary nodes and no high risk factor, adjuvant cytotoxic chemotherapy may not be'beneﬁcial. 

For cases whose primary tumors are 2-5 cm in widest diameter, and with no high- risk factor, adjuvant CMF may be beneﬁcial. 

'For cases with at least one of the high-risk factors, an anthracycline containing chemotherapy combination may be beneﬁcial. 

Taxanes are indicated for ER negative patients with at least one of the following high-isk factors: grade, 3 histologic grade, age &lt 35, triple-negative disease and/or Her2/neu overexpression particularly if they have fully consented to use the most Optimal treatment appropriate to their condition that is provided within the program. 

Some rare histological types (e.g. medullary, apocrine, adenoid cystic carcinoma) with neither axillary node involvement nor a high-risk factor may not beneﬁt from adjuvant cytotoxic chemotherapy.

XI. Patient Follow Up 

Monitoring and follow-up care should be done with the goals Of detecting and managing treatment-related side effects, screening for recurrence or progression of disease or the growth of a new primary tumor and the provision of psychosocial support. After completion of treatment, "it is recommended that patients are followed up every 3 months within the ﬁrst year, every 6 months in the second and third years and then annually for uptO 10 years. 

The use, of an intensive metastatic work up following primary surgical treatment does not result in longer survival compared to symptom directed work up, and should not be routinely used. ' ' 

Follow up consists of careful history and physical examination. In addition, annual mammography of the contralateral breast following modiﬁed radical mastectomy, or, Of the contralateral and conserved ipsilateral breast following a breast conserving procedure is recommended. 

Continuity of care is recommended in the community or primary care setting which should be linked to a specialized hospital with the capacity to deliver effective cancer treatment and management.
