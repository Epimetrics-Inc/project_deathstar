<body>

Procurement of goods requested in small quantities even after the DOH consolidation of the various Project Procurement Management Plans from the various Services/Bureaus Ofﬁces can be more efﬁciently and effectively undertaken by the ofﬁces concerned than by the Bids and Awards Committee or the Procurement Division which is mandated to prioritize bulk procurement transactions for the Department's priority programs. To ensure that urgent, emergency, recurring supplies and materials needed are made available, the Services/Bureaus/Ofﬁces and the Procurement Division are given the authority to procure supplies and materials under the following conditions and amounts:

1. Supplies and materials costing below or equal to ﬁfteen thousand pesos (P15,000), either on an item or transaction basis which are immediately needed and recurring; and cannot be paid conveniently by check or are required to be paid immediately shall be procured by the Service/Bureau/Ofﬁce concerned using their cash advance subject to the provisions of COA Circular 97-002 dated February 10, 1997.

2. When there is an unexpected or unforeseen eventuality requiring immediate purchase, the Service/Bureau/Ofﬁce concerned shall also be given the authority to conduct local shopping for goods whose total cost shall not eXceed ﬁfty thousand pesos (P50,000) as stipulated in RA 9184 Section 52.a. The following mode of payment may be resorted to as may be allowed by existing government rules and regulations:

2.1 Through the usual payment procedure after the submission of the abstract of canvass and procurement request by the concerned ofﬁce to the Procurement Division (PD), and price monitoring and issuance of purchase order by the PD and delivery, inspection and acceptance of the goods.
2.2 Through cash advance, as allowed by accounting and auditing rules and regulations
2.3 Through reimbursement.

3. The Procurement Division is given the authority to take charge of the alternative modes of procurement listed below after the reCommendation/ approval of the COBAC of the mode of procurement (Section 121 of RA 9184) for the various procurement packages in the approved DOH annual procurement plan and the corresponding procurement requests from the various ofﬁces. The PD shall present the consolidated or aggregated and grouped procurement packages to the COBAC for recommendation / approval of the mode of procurement before any procurement is undertaken by the COBAC secretariat.

3.1 Other modes of procurement for amounts not exceeding P250,000

3.1.1 Local shopping of ordinary ofﬁce supplies and equipment not available in the PS-DBM. Such purchase shall not result in the splitting of contracts based on RA 9184 Section 54.1 and shall require at least three(3) price quotations from reputable suppliers are obtained.
