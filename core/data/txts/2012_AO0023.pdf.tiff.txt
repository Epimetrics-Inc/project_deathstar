<body>


I. RATIONALE 

The 1987 Philippine Constitution mandates the right of every Filipino to health. It enunciates the policy that “the State shall protect and promote the health of the people and instill health consciousness among them” (Article II Section 15). Furthermore, it provides the adoption by the State of an “integrated and comprehensive approach to health development which shall endeavor to make essential goods, health and other social services accessible to all the people at affordable cost” (Article XII Section 15). 

To support these goals, several policies and laws have been passed. These include Republic Act No. 6675 known. as the Generics Act of 1988 that was enacted to “ensure the adequate supply of drugs with generic names at the lowest possible cost.” It further states that “in the promotion of the generic names for pharmaceutical products, special consideration shall be given to drugs and medicines which are included in the Essential Drugs List to be prepared within one hundred eighty (180) days from approval of this Act and updated quarterly by the Department of Health on the basis of health conditions obtaining in the Philippines as well as on internationally accepted criteria.” 

Executive Order No. 49 (dated 21 January 1993, entitled “Directing the Mandatory Use of the Philippine National Formulary Volume I as the Basis for Procurement of Drug Products by the Government”) strengthened the advocacy of the Generics Act by ensuring that only essential medicines identiﬁed. in their generic names will be procured by all government institutions. 

Administrative Order No. 163 s. 2002 (entitled “Implementing Guidelines and Procedures in the Procurement" and Requisition of Drugs and Medicines by the Department of Health pursuant to Executive Order No. 49”) provides the procedural bases that ensure requisition of essential medicines by the Government sector and the decision system for the inclusion and deletion of medicines in the Philippine National Drug Formulary (PNDF). 

The Philippine Health Insurance Corporation (PHI’C) Board Resolution No. 265 (dated 15 July 1999) likewise provides that the PNDF Volume I shall be the basis for claims reimbursements for medicines. 

The more recent RA 9502 enacted in 2008 provides additional power to the President of the Philippines to impose, upon the recommendation of the Secretary of Health, maximum retail prices over medicines that include, among others, the “drugs and medicines that are included in the Philippine National Drug F ormulary Essential Drug List.” 

The Philippine National Drug Formulary continues to serve as the national reference for quality and rational selection of the medicines which are vital in achieving the best health outcomes. Given the importance of the PNDF in the attainment of universal access to quality essential medicines, the systems, procedures and processes to formulate and update the previous Administrative Orders, AO 2006-0018 Implementing Guidelines for the Philippine National F ormulary System (08 May 2006) and two addenda AO 2006-0018—A (l 7 April 2008) and A0 2006-0018-B (07 October 2010) need to be reviewed and enhanced. 

 
II. OBJECTIVES 

This issuance aims to: 


A. Describe the new systems and procedures for: 

1. the selection of medicines to be included in or deleted from the Essential Drug List hereafter referred to as the National Essential Medicines list; 

2. the development of a new format of the Philippine National Formulary that integrates all three volumes of the previous PNDF, namely, the National Essential Medicines List, the Formulary Monographs and the Cross-Reference Index, and which shall be referred to as the PNF Manual; and 

3. the promotion of the use of the Formulary among the different levels of healthcare managers and providers and the consumers. 

B. Reconstitute the Formulary Committee and describe the implementation arrangements of the Philippine National Formulary System (PNFS). 

III. SCOPE 

This Order shall be applicable to all health facilities, units and ofﬁces of the entire government sector insofar as drug procurements are concerned and shall. be applicable to the entire health sector (both government and private) insofar as the Philippine Health Insurance Corporation claims for drug reimbursements are concerned. 

IV. DEFINITION OF TERMS 

A. ESSENTIAL MEDICINES- These are medicines that satisfy the priority health care needs of the population and which are selected based on the evidence of their efﬁcacy, safety and comparative cost— effectiveness. These medicines shall be made available and affordable at all times. The prioritization of the health care need shall be based on the burden of the disease. 


Essential medicines are classiﬁed into: 

1. CORE MEDICINES — These are the most efﬁcacious, safest and most cost-effective medicines for priority diseases and health care needs. These are intended to be available at all times in adequate quantities in appropriate dosage forms and at the lowest possible cost. 

2. COMPLEMENTARY MEDICINES— These are medicines used: 

a. as alternatives when medicines in the core list are ineffective or inappropriate fora given individual or when core medicines cannot be made available; 

b. for priority diseases for which specialized diagnostic or monitoring facilities and/or specialized medical care, and/ or specialized training are needed; 

c. for non-prevalent diseases that are life-threatening (i.e., likely to cause death if untreated) or that are disabling (i.e., likely to cause permanent disability if untreated); 

d. for diseases or conditions prevalent in a sector of the population with special needs; and 

e. for diseases that are endemic in a particular area or for diseases conﬁned in a limited setting at a given time. 


V. GENERAL GUIDELINES 

A. The new edition of the Philippine National Drug Formulary shall be referred to as the Philippine National Formulary (PNF) with its inpats, processes and outputs collectively referred to as the Philippine National Formulary System (PNFS). 

B. The Formulary Committee shall be reconstituted and hereafter referred to as the Formulary Executive Council (FEC).
