<subject>SUBJECT: Prescribing the official hours of duty of the newly-hired NFPC Health Extension Workers (HEW) and their Supervisors or Team Leaders.</subject>

<body>
As a corollary to D.O. Nos. 118-C and 122, both series of 1977, the Health Extention Workers listed therein including their Supervisors or Team Leaders, who were recently hired on a casual basis and assigned to sitios and barrios of the five (5) pilot provinces, namely: Bukidnon, Cagayan, Negros Occidental, Oriental Mindoro and Western Samar primarily to reinforce the IEC component of this Department's Family Planning Program, which suffered quite a setback with the phasing out of the Lay Motivators, are to observe the following official hours of duty.

Monday to Friday Inclusive

8:00 o'clock a.m. to 12:00 o'clock noon;
1:00 o'clock p.m. to 4:00 o'clock p.m.;

and

Saturday

8:00 o'clock a.m. to 1:00 o'clock p.m.;

or, a total of forty (40) hours a week labor.

Computed on the basis of ₱2.00 and ₱3.00 an hour wage rate for each HEW and Team Leader, or, on a daily basis of ₱14.00 and ₱21.00 for rendering service seven (7) hours every regular day, and ₱10.00 and ₱15.00 for five (5) hours' service on Saturday, their total weekly pay will be ₱80.00 and ₱120.00, respectively, for forty (40) hours labor a week.

Since the HEWs and Team Leaders are to serve as the primary links between the staff of the Rural Health/Family Planning Center, Barangay Health Stations and the Community as well as the other Barangay workers in the area, it was deemed practical to make their official hours of duty conform with that of the former (the FH/FP) Center personnel) for the purpose of facilitating coordination and cooperation.

Payments of the prescribed rates of wages of the abovementioned casual employees shall be subject to availability of funds and the usual accounting and auditing rules and regulations.
