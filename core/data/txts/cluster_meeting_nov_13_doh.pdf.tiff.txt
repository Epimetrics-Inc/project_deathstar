Hon. Enrique T. Ona, MD Secretary 
Department of Health 
San Lazaro Compound, Rizal Ave., 
Sta.Cruz, Manila 

Dear Hon. Ona: 

The Integrated Government Philippines (iGovPhil) Project, a joint undertaking of the Department of Science and Technology (DOST) - Information and Communications Technology Office (ICTO) and the DOST-Advanced Science and Technology (ASTI), was formally launched during the National ICT Summit last June 28, 2012. 

This Project aims to make the government more open to the public by establishing a web- based portal that will provide convenient access to government online services nationwide. It also endeavors to generate savings through integration and use of existing government assets, and to create opportunities for possible collaboration with the private sector on future online applications. 

Last June 26, 2012, we conducted a Stakeholder Orientation to partner agencies. We are grateful that the agencies demonstrated their support to the promotion of the e- government. And we are pleased to inform you that your agency has been identified as one of the pilot agencies for the initial phase of the implementation of the iGovPhil Project. 

In this regard, we are requesting your good office for the following: 

1. Designate a focal person or persons who will coordinate and facilitate concerns relating to the Project. Ideally, the focal person should be at least a Division Chief and should have sufficient knowledge about the information and communication setup of your respective agency. 

2. Provide us the following information of the assigned focal person/s: 

Name of focal person/s: 

Position/ Office: 
Agency name: 
Address: 
Telephone number: 
Fax number: 
Email address: 


3. Accomplish the two-part ICT resources survey, which aims to gather baseline information for a detailed summary of the current situation in each government organization, on or before November 5, 2012. It can be found at the following url:
 

Moreover, may we invite your assigned focal person or persons to attend the initial cluster meeting on November 13, 2012, 9:00 AM to 2:00 PM at the Audio-Visual Room, G/F NCC- ICTO Bldg. Carlos P. Garcia Avenue, UP Campus Diliman, Quezon City, to discuss the updates and developments of the project.
