1.1 "Registration" means the process of approval for the manufacture, importation, exportation, sale, offer for sale, distribution or transfer of pharmaceutical products containing active ingredient(s) of known chemical structure and properties determined to be safe, efficacious, and of good quality according to standards of BFAD. 

1.2 "Pharmaceutical Product" means any pharmaceutical or biological product containing active ingredients responsible for its desired effect intended for use in the diagnosis, cure, mitigation, treatment or prevention of disease or to affect the structure or function of the body of man or animal.
