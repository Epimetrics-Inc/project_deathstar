<subject>SUBJECT: Establishing Improved Procedures and Systems for a Synchronised DOH Planning and Budget Process</subject>

<body>

Memorandum Order No. 295, series of 1990, of the Office of the President, has directed the adoption and implementation of a synchronized planning-programming-budgeting system (SPPBS). In this context, this Administrative Order is being issued to prescribe guidelines for the establishment and institutionalization of improved procedures and systems for the synchronized planning and budget process in the Department of Health (DOH).


Section 1. Rationale. The existing planning and budget procedures and systems still  stand a lot of improvement if the DOH is to ensure the efficiency of its current level of budget and that government spending in health is directed to the most important needs of the people.

For the past three (3) years, efforts were made to come up with a planning and budget cycle that will clearly establish the link between the plan and the budget, as well as synchronize the process. Performance reviews vis a vis the budget utilisation have been conducted to trace and eventually resolve the operational deficiencies in the current management systems and  procedures. Thus, it has been found out that some budget proposals were being prepared on incremental basis without really undertaking sound and rational operational planning. On the  other hand, some operational plans were prepared but were never used as basis of budget proposals. These have been found evident in poor targets set, weak scheduling of activities and  budgetary requirements, inconsistencies in budget releases with activities (particularly in respect  to object of classiﬁcation), and thus in poor budget utilization.

The improved planning and budget process intends to synchronize and closely link these  two management functions together in order to ensure that the priority programs and activities in the operational plant will be properly and correspondingly translated into budgetary terms. The system is also expected to bring about the efficient and effective utilisation of budget allocations for health, speciﬁcally for the DOH. It shall likewise seek to elicit wider  involvement, better participation and commitment, as well as strengthen coordination among  planners, ﬁnance/budget officers, technical and administrative staff, and implementors.

     
Section 2. The Planning and Budget Cycle. For the effective management of resources, the Planning and Budget Cycle shall be a continuous affair of the Department and its component services/programs/offices/units. It shall consist of three (3) phases, namely: (1) operational planning and budgeting, (2) work and ﬁnancial planning (budget execution), and (3) performance and budget utilization reviews (budget accountability).

A synchronized planning and budgeting calendar contained in Annex I (attached) shall  be adopted DOH—wide, for this purpose.


Section 3. Procedures for Preparing a Budget Proposal

3.1 The Planning and Budget Committee. To ensure widest participation and consultation in the preparation of budget proposals, Planning and Budget Committees at the Central Office, Regional and Hospital levels shall be existent.

3.1.1 The Planning and Budget Committees will be responsible for preparing their respective office’s/hospital’s budget proposals which would involve the following:

a. Reviewing the Operational Plan
b. Deﬁning the program/project/activity 
c. Determining the target for each program/proiect/activity 
d. Costing the program/project/activity using the program budget system 

3.1.2 Each head of ofﬁce/hospital is authorized to constitute the membership of the Planning and Budget Committee at his level. A suggested composition of committee at different levels is, however provided in Annex II (attached). It is presumed that the head of office/hospital is automatically the Chairman of the Committee.

3.2 Operational Planning and Budgeting.

3.2.1 The planning and budget cycle shall commence fifteen (15)  months prior to the implementation year with the formulation of an annual  operational plan by each ofﬁce, program, service, unit, regional field ofﬁce,  including retained hospital.

3.2.2 Every September of each year, the EXECUTIVE Committee (EXECOM) shall decide the policy that will be used in preparing the operational plan and budget at the succeeding year. This will constitute the  Policy Guidelines for operational planning.

3.2.3 Speciﬁc and more detailed guidelines in the preparation of the  Operational Plan, including the Policy Guidelines thus formulated, shall be issued by the DOH management through the Internal Planning Service (IPS). The IPS shall coordinate with the Office for Health Facilities, Standards and Regulations (OHFSR) for speciﬁc hospital planning guidelines.

3.2.4 The operational plain shall consider the priority projects or activities based on needs, taking into account the levels of current and previous budgets. The existing Medium-Term Philippine Development Plan (MTPDP) and Medium-Term Public Investment Program (MTPIP) shall also be used as bases in the formulation of the Operational Plan.

3.2.5 An Operational Plan should have the necessary minimum contents, i.e. activities, objectives, target, time frame, resource requirements and performance indicators.

3.2.6 The head of office, as Chairman of the Planning and Budget Committee at each level (e.g. the Undersecretaries at the central level; the Regional Directors at the regional level) shall review and approve the Operational Plans of the services, programs, hospitals and other facilities under his supervision.

3.2.7 The Integrated Regional Health Plans which incorporate the plans of retained hospitals and other health facilities in the regions, as well as the plans of the different programs and services in the Central Ofﬁce, shall be submitted to the IPS for consolidation. Operational Plans of special hospitals, on the other hand, shall be submitted to the OHFSR for review and evaluation. All these plans shall then be submitted to the Central Ofﬁce Planning and Budget Committee for ﬁnal review and evaluation. 

3.2.8 The evaluated operational plans shall be the basis for budget preparation by the operating units upon assistance of the budget call by the DBM.

3.2.9 The Finance Service shall consolidate the budget proposals of all operating units as prescribed by the budget call. On this basis, it shall prepare the DOIH Budget Proposal of the succeeding year, and present to the EXECUTIVE Committee for approval.

3.2.10 The approved DOH Bridget Proposal shall be submitted to the DBM as prescribed in the budget call.


Section 4. Work And Financial Planning

4.1 The Work and Financial Plans (WFP) of the different ofﬁces, services, programs, units, regions, including retained hospitals, shall be prepared upon approval of the budget by the Congress.

4.2 The WFP shall be based on the respective Action Plan or evaluated/approved operational plan of each office, service, region, hospital.

4.3 The WFP consists of the Work Plan and the Financial Plan. The Work Plan provides the description or the activity, purpose, output, duration and the targets. This is used in evaluating the performance of the ofﬁce/unit in relation to the fund releases. The Financial Plan presents the monthly ﬁnancial operating requirements of the Work Plan by indicating the speciﬁc object of expenditure that will be incurred to accomplish the target for each activity. It also indicates when funds will be needed fee each activity.

4.4 Specific or detailed guidelines in the preparation and submission of the Annual Work and Financial Plan shall be issued by the Ofﬁce for Management Services (OMS).

4.5 The Undersecretaries shall review and approve the WFP of services and programs under his supervision.

4.6 The work Plans and the Financial Plans should be submitted to the IPS  and the OMS, respectively, for consolidation and submission to DBM.


Section 5. Performance and Budget Utilization Review. The conduct of Performance and Budget Utilization Reviews has proven to be a very useﬁil venue for identifying and eventually addressing problems in implementation and management of resources. As a policy, the DOH would like to provide a continuum for its institutionalization.

5.1 The Department shall adopt two (2) options in the conduct of performance and resource utilization reviews, i.e., rolling or year—round and end-of- year reviews. Performance and budget reviews from time to time on a year-round basis shall be conducted for each program, service, unit, region, including retained hospital by their respective undersecretaries or designated heads. It shall be incumbent upon the undersecretaries or heads of each ofﬁce to make a feedback on the relevant issues and recommendations arising from such activity to the DOH management.

5.2 The end—of-year performance and resource utilization review shall be initiated by the DoH management, through the Office of the Chief of Staff. The  Undersecretaries shall conduct the review.

5.3 The performance indicators set on an annual basis shall be used as the standard for the review of accomplishments. For this purpose, the following indicators may be used:

a. Output Indicators, for quarterly assessment, and
b. Outcome Indicators which could be the basis for policy formulation.

5.4 As a matter of policy, reasonable budget utilisation based on obligations shall be not less than 90% of budget allocation. Review of resource/budget utilization shall cover all resources provided to the service, program, unit, region or hospital, whether in cash or in kind, and whether they come from GOP funds or other sources.


Section 6. Definition of Roles

6.1 It shall be the responsibility of each program manager or head of an ofﬁce, service, unit or hospital to orchestrate their planning and budgeting process, with the assitance of their respective Designated Planning and Budget Ofﬁcers.

6.2 On a department—wide basis, the offices will take the major lead roles for the efficient implementation of this Order, apart from those already aforementioned and those speciﬁed in Annex I, are as follows:

a. Ofﬁce for Management Services - responsible for cash control and monitoring of expenditures;

b. Office of the Chief of Staff/IPS - in charge of monitoring accomplishments (i.e., physical targets and performance).


Section 7. Effectivity. This Order shall take effect immediately.
