<subject>SUBJECT: Revised National Sexually Transmitted Infections (STI) Case Management Guidelines</subject>

<body>
I. Background:

Recognizing the public importance of Sexually Transmitted Infections (STI), particularly in the era of AIDS various administrative orders were prepared to intensify STI care and prevention strategy. Administrative Order #2 s 1997 "The National Policy Guidelines for the Prevention and Management of Sexually Transmitted Diseases (STI) was developed to provide strategic directions for future activities and complement the existing guidelines on the National AIDS/ STI Prevention and Control program. It forms the basis for the prevention and management of STI at all levels of health care system nationwide. One of the components of the guideline is the promotion of the syndromic approach to STI case management when reliable laboratory diagnostic support is not consistently available. A training manual on the Comprehensive STD Case Management has been developed and implemented.

To provide directions on the STI case management at the different levels of health care system from tertiary hospitals down to the barangay health stations, Administrative Order # 5 s 1998 "Implementing Guidelines in STI Case Management at the different levels of the Health Care System" was developed. This guideline provided standards for the implementation of syndromic STI case management at all levels of health care, defined roles, functions and requirements in the provision of STI services at all levels of health care, establish the referral system of STI case management and extent of care and technical boundaries that can be provided at the different levels of care.

A validation study on syndromic approach to the National STI Case Management was conducted to improve the quality of STI care provided by increasing the diagnostic validity of the national STI case management guidelines. The study aimed to determine the validity of the Philippine flowchart for vaginal discharge and urethral discharge and determine the etiological agents causing vaginal discharge in women and urethral discharge in men.

Based on the results of the study and after consensus with STI technical committee, a new National STI Case Management Guidelines is being recommended for the management of vaginal discharge in women. The flowcharts being recommended have a good balance. of sensitivity, specificity and positive predictive value, thus reducing over treatment and under treatment. It is more cost effective and has a better diagnostic validity compared to the current National STI Case Management Guidelines. It is also feasible to be implemented in the primary level of care and has a good compromise between the technical accuracy and realities in the field.

II. Purpose:

1. To provide health care workers in all levels of the health system guidance and a standard approach in managing STI,
2. To enable all health care workers at all levels of the health system to provide effective, acceptable and affordable STI case management; and,
3. To make recommendations on the best drugs to use

III. Scope:

These guidelines replace the flowcharts recommended in the training manual on "Comprehensive STI Case Management" specifically on the module on Syndromic Approach to STI. In order to provide a more universal effective STI management these guidelines will be utilized in all health facilities with limited capabilities for etiologic diagnosis of STI among patients with reproductive tract infections and sexually transmitted infections. These guidelines will provide the basis for the management of vaginal discharge and lower abdominal pain in women, urethral discharge and scrotal swelling in men and genital ulcers in men and women.

IV. Guidelines and Procedures:

To ensure a more cost effective approach in the management of STI in the Philippines the following guidelines and flowcharts are being recommended:

A. Management of Women with Vaginal Discharge:

1. In the absence of laboratory support and facilities for genital examination, vaginal discharge should be managed as a case of vaginitis. If symptoms persist after treatment this must be referred to a higher level of care where facilities for genital examination and laboratory testing are possible.

2. In the absence of laboratory support (microscope, simple reagents and trained health personnel to perform the test) but with facilities for genital examination such as:

■ Presence of sterile speculum and examining gloves
■ A private area with good lighting with an examining table for genital examination and with a trained health care worker and the patient agrees.

The flowchart below is recommended.

IV. IMPLEMENTING MECHANISM

Administrative Order #5, s, 1998 will stay in effect to provide guidance in the implementation of the revised STI Case Management.

The following will be the role and nature of assistance at the Department of Health and the local government units in implementing the revised guidelines.

A. Role of Department of Health and Nature of Assistance

1. Provide technically sound recommendations as the need arise to improve STI case management at all levels of health care.
2. Provide training of trainers on STI case management.
3. Develop standardized training modules and materials.
4. Monitor and conduct evaluation of the quality of STI case management and training.
5. Advocate to policy makers, local government units the importance of providing adequate STI services to generate resources, sustain the implementation of activities and develop local policies that are consistent with national policies.
6. Coordinate the implementation of activities at the different levels of health care system to ensure proper utilization of limited resources, prevent duplications of functions and render adequate referral mechanism.
7. Develop methodologies and procedures for referral

B. Role of Local Government Unit and Nature of Assistance

1. Implement these guidelines for the management of STI.
2. Provide adequate resources and environment for the provision of STI services.
3. Ensure that effective, acceptable STI services are available at the local health unit.

ANNEX

NOTES ON THE VAGINAL DISCHARGE FLOWCHART

Note a: Patient with vaginal discharge:
• The woman complains of a vaginal discharge OR
• says she has had recent change in quality or amount of discharge OR
• is found on examination to have a significant discharge

Note b: Take history - Intercourse with a partner with urethral discharge in the cast three months?
If yes, treat automatically for VAGINITIS and CERVICITIS

Note c: History and clinical examination including laboratory specimens:
• History taken including the questions in the behavioral assessment.
• gynecological examination
• laboratory tests which include Whiff test and KOH wet mount examination

Note d: Behavioral AND clinical assessments positive?
A behavioral assessment is POSITIVE if one or more of the following factors are present.

• If all medications have been taken at right dosage and frequency.
• If the patient has refrained from intercourse.

If the answer to either question is no retreat the patient and follow through the flowchart. Remember to repeat your education emphasizing treatment compliance and encouraging all partners to get treatment.

NOTES ON GENITAL ULCER DISEASES FLOWCHART

Note a: A single ulcer is more likely to be syphilis
Note b: A painful ulcer is likely to be herpes.
Note c: If it is not resolving after on week with herpes care, it requires specialist evaluation.
Note d: A single painless ulcer is likely to be syphilis

Treatment for herpes
• Acyclovir 200 mg 5 times a day for 7-10 days or until resolution
• Saline soaks and dressing if recurrent or mild attack.

NOTES ON SCROTAL SWELLING FLOWCHART

Note a: It is very important that surgical emergencies such as torsion of the testis are not mistaken for an infection of the testis and or epididymis. A careful history and examination will diminish this risk. Surgical problems usually come on quickly and acutely rather than gradually as with an infection. Examination will often reveal if the testis is twisted and feels anatomically unusual.

Note b: If it is a surgical problem the referral is urgent. A matter of hours may make a difference in saving the function of a twisted testis

Note c: Only condoms and counseling are necessary.

Note d: Treat for gonorrhea and chlamydia
• cefixime 400mg as a single dose OR ceftriaxone 250mg as a single intramuscular injection PLUS
• doxycycline 100mg twice daily for seven days OR
• azithromycin 1 gram as single dose

NOTES ON LOWER ABDOMINAL PAIN FLOWCHART

Note a: It is important to at least be able to do bimanual examination. If possible also do a speculum examination to see if pus is coming from the cervix. If examination is not possible, the patient should be referred urgently.

Note b: Any of these suggests an abdominal emergency such as tubal abscess, peritonitis, and ectopic pregnancy and require urgent referral.

Note c: Any of these indicate pelvic inflammatory disease treatable as an outpatient.

Note d: Treatment for PID
• cefixime 400mg as a single dose OR
• ceftriaxone 250mg as a single intramuscular injection PLUS
• doxycycline 100mg twice daily for 14 days PLUS
