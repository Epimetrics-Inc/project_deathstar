In view of the unexpected present economic situation brought about by the recent oil price increases which disturbed and affected the smooth implementation of the open date marking, and in order to accommodate the requests of the various government sectors and food processor for more dialogue and have sufficient time to generate more information on shelf life, paragraph 12.3 of Adm. Order No. 16 s. 1979 is hereby amended as follows:

The start-up date for this date making order shall be on the date of effectivity. Food manufacturers and importers may start complying with this Order at any time from the start-up date prescribed herein; provided, that processed food listed in Section 12.3 of Administrative Order No. 16 s 1979 shall carry the prescribed "consume before" marking on a date to be announced by the Minister of Health and which date is not earlier that July, 1980.

This regulation amends Administrative Order No. 16 s 1979, and shall take effect immediately upon approval.
