<subject>SUBJECT: GUIDELINES ON THE RECOGNITION OF FAMILY PLANNING TRAINING PROVIDERS OF THE DOH </subject>
<body>

I. BACKGROUND and RATIONALE 

Pursuant to Sections 6.02 and 6.04 of the Implementing Rules and Regulations of the Responsible Parenthood and Reproductive Health Act of 2012 (RA 10354), the DOH shall develop guidelines to ensure the training of the SDN skilled health professionals to meet the required clinical competencies. In the process, it may certify speciﬁc institutions, whether from the government or from the private sector, to deliver training services. In addition, the DOH shall also develop guidelines to determine the ideal number of skilled health professionals to meet its annual targets for maternal health care and skilled birth attendance. 

DOH Administrative Order (A0) no. 2012—0009, otherwise known as the National Strategy towards Reducing Unmet Need for Modern Family Flaming, provides the following: training on all modern FP services shall be made available to all public and private service providers; and all DOH regional medical centers are designated as training centers. However, to date, there are currently only 30 medical centers providing BTL-MLLA training nationwide. Despite the order, it has been observed that the difﬁculty in sustaining the availability of training providers is due to factors, suCh as; few number of trainers, which mostly come from the public sector only; fast turnover of skilled/ trained health providers; and, in some areas, geographic inaccessibility of training institutions. Moreover, even if trainings have been conducted, only very few trainers have been able to complete the certiﬁcation process, which extends all the way to post-training supervision in order to validate skills proﬁciency. As consequence, only a few trained FP providers are deemed proﬁcient enough to cascade training to other service providers. 

To address the foregoing concern and comply with the RPRH Law, the DOH needs to facilitate a process for recognizing potential trainers for modern family planning methods. While training processes are in place for BTL-MLLA, NSV, IUD, and FPCBT 1, work is still to be done for new program methods including PPIUD and Subdermal Implants. 

This issuance also recognizes the rich experience of DOH in establishing training centers for and certifying BEmONC-capable facilities. From three (3) training institutions conducting skills training in 2008 it has expanded to thirty (30) training centers by 2014. Similar traction is needed for training on modern FP services in order to bridge the gap of increasing demand for modern FF and limited access to skilled service level providers. 

II. OBJECTIVES 

These objectives of this Order are as follows: 

A. Increase the number of available service delivery points that can provide quality FP services by installing a DOH process that will quickly recognize existing FP training providers - individuals or institutions to augment DOH capacity to cascade training to frontline service staff. 

B. Install a process for DOH to build up a next generation cadre of trainers. 

C. Ensure that this process allows DOH to maintain an acceptable level of quality of its FP training providers. 

III. SCOPE and COVERAGE
