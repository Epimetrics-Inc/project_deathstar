<subject>SUBJECT: Establishment of a National Substance Abuse Prevention, Treatment and Rehabilitation Program (NSAPTRP)</subject>

<body>

I. Background

Drug abuse is identified as one, of the first ten health problems in the Philippines during a nationwide focused group discussion conducted by the Essential  National Health Research. While no reliable statistics exist on the magnitude of the
Philippine drug abuse problem, the problem is undoubtedly considered serious.

Several agencies have attempted to respond to the problem. The Department of Health (DOH) through Dangerous Drug Board (DDB) formulated a National Treatment and Rehabilitation Program for Drug Dependents which has since served as a guide for the conduct of national efforts to treat and rehabilitate drug dependents with the DDB as the overall coordinator of anti-drug abuse efforts nationwide. Ever since its inception, there has been a modest increase in the number of treatment and rehabilitation facilities nationwide. Currently, there are 28 residential rehabilitation centers of which 10 are government and 18 non-governmental. The governmental residential rehabilitation facilities remain over-utilized while residential facilities run by non-governmental organizations are under-utilized. It is also noted that the existing centers are inequitably distributed. In 1976, the DOH via an Ad-Hoc committee proposed to establish treatment and rehabilitation centers in every region. Due to the staggering budgetary requirements however, only the Welcome Station was established in the grounds of the National Center for Mental Health (NCMH). In 1999, an Anti—Drug Abuse Task Force Technical Committee came up with recommendations for the prevention, control and management of drug abuse. The plan unfortunately never took off from the drawing boards because of what once again turned out to be prohibitive budgetary requirements.

Clearly, the problem of drug abuse is widely recognized and attempts have been made to address the need for more efficient and equitably distributed rehabilitation centers. If the response is to be adequate however, there is a need for a more comprehensive but stepwise approach in order to allow for gradual budgetary allocation and integration. 


II. Policy

It shall be the policy of DOH to develop and provide preventive, therapeutic and rehabilitative services for substance abusers. These services must be culturally adapted to Philippine setting.


III. The National Substance Abuse Treatment and Rehabilitation Program

The term Substance Abuse is used to encompass the following substance related disorders: 

1. Substance Abuse

A maladaptive pattern of use leading to clinically significant impairment or distress, as manifested by one or more of the following occurring in a 12 month period.

1.1 Recurrent substance use resulting in a failure to fulfill major role obligations at work, school or home (e.g. repeated absences, poor work performance related to substance use; substance related absences, suspensions and expulsions from school or neglect of children or household)

1.2 Recurrent substance use in situations in which it is physically hazardous (e.g. driving automobile or operating a machine, when impaired by substance use). 

1.3 Recurrent substance related legal problems (arrest for substance related disorderly conduct).

1.4 Continued substance use despite having persistent or recurrent social or interpersonal problems caused or exacerbated by the effects of the substance (e.g. arguments with spouse about consequences of intoxication).

2. Substance Intoxication

2.1 The development of a reversible substance—specific syndrome due to recent ingestion of a substance.

2.2 Clinically significant maladaptive behavioral or psychological changes that are due to the effect of the substance on the central nervous system (e.g. belligerence, mood liability, cognitive impairment, impaired judgement, impaired social or occupational functioning) and developed during or shortly after use of the substance.

2.3 Symptoms are not due to a general medical condition and are not better accounted for by another mental disorder.

3. Substance Withdrawal 

3.1 The development of a substance-specific syndrome due to the cessation of (or reduction in) substance use that has been heavy and prolonged.

3.2 The substance—specific syndrome causes clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational or other important areas of functioning. 

3.3, The symptoms are not due to a general medical condition and are not better accounted for by another mental disorder. 

4. Substance Dependence

A maladaptive pattern of substance use, leading to clinically significant impairment or distress as manifested by 3 or more of the following, occurring at any time in the same 12 month-period. 

4.1 Tolerance, as defined by either of the following:

a. Need for markedly increased amount of the substance to achieve intoxication or desired effect. 
b. Markedly diminished effect with continued use of the same amount of the substance. 

4.2 Withdrawal as manifested by either of the following:

a. the characteristic withdrawal syndrome for the substance
b. the same (or closely related) substance is taken to relieve or avoid withdrawal symptoms 

4.3 The substance is often taken in larger amounts or over longer periods than was intended.

4.4 There is a persistent desire or unsuccessful efforts to cut down or control substance use. 

4.5 A great deal of time is spent in activities necessary to obtain the substance (e.g. visiting multiple doctors or driving long distance) to use the substance, (chain smokers) or to recover from its effects. 

4.6 Important social, occupational or recreational activities are given up or reduced because of substance use.

4.7 The substance use is continued despite knowledge or having a persistent or recurrent physical problem or psychological problem that is likely to  have been caused or exacerbated by the substance (e.g. current cocaine use despite recognition of cocaine-induced depression, or continued drinking despite recognition that an ulcer was made worse by alcohol consumption.)

A. Rationale

While there have been past efforts to respond to the Philippine drug  abuse problem, much remains to be done particularly with respect to  prevention, treatment and rehabilitation. The current program aims to address  the multidimensional substance abuse problem not only through research  information education campaign but also through actual provision of therapeutic, rehabilitative and aftercare services.

B. Program Vision 

The establishment and operation of a Substance Abuse Prevention, Treatment and Rehabilitation Center in each region that is truly appropriate and sensitive to the Philippine setting. These centers shall have facilities for

1. Information dissemination and education
2. Diagnosis 
3. Treatment
4. Rehabilitation
5. Referral
6. Training
7. Research

C. Linkages 

The DOH shall establish intra—agency, inter-agency and multi-sectoral linkages to broaden and deepen the scope of the program and enhance its operationalization. Once the budget of the NSAPTRP has been integrated in the DOH budget allocation, it will be gradually phased-in to become a unit of the mental health program of the DOH.

D. Program Goals and Objectives:

General Objective:

To establish a substance abuse prevention treatment and rehabilitation center which is integrated with the general hospital care system in each region. 

Specific Objectives:

1. To design functional and structural models for prevention, treatment and rehabilitation centers within identified DOH—retained tertiary level general hospitals.
2. To formulate general, clinical, and administrative policies in the operation of DOH prevention, treatment and rehabilitation centers. 
3. To train trainors on drug treatment and rehabilitation with the end in view of multiplying trained personnel.
4. To develop a program based on successful experience of models on drug rehabilitation that is culturally adapted, appropriate and effective in the Philippine setting.
5. To evolve mechanisms to phase—in the budgetary requirements of the program to the DOH annual budget. 
6. To review it and strengthen collaborative relationship with existing governmental (GO) and non-governmental organizations (NGO) involved in substance abuse prevention, treatment, and rehabilitation.
7. To undertake research activities pertinent to substance abuse.
8. To provide technical assistance to agencies whether governmental or non—governmental interested in establishing similar services. 

E. Strategies

To achieve the program’s goals and objectives, the DOH, in collaboration with the other agencies and various governmental and non-governmental organizations shall implement the following strategies: 

1. Networking

A system of communication and collaboration with NGO’s, Local Government Unit’s (LGU), research institutions, and agencies shall be established through the National Substance Abuse Prevention, Treatment and Rehabilitation Program. A close working relationship with researchers, academic institutions and funding agencies shall also be effected. Networking activities shall be undertaken by the substance abuse prevention, treatment and rehabilitation centers in each region.

2. Advocacy 

Activities that will generate public visibility and wider public understanding of substance abuse shall be undertaken. This shall be done through multi-media campaigns, distribution of information/education materials and official pronouncements.

3. Resource Development

Nationwide training and resource development shall be established and conducted. The Department shall involve itself in institution building.

4. Legislative agenda

The development of legislations that will facilitate the development, establishment and maintenance of the National Substance Abuse Prevention, Treatment and Rehabilitation Program shall be undertaken. The Department shall also collaborate with concerned NGOs and agencies to work for the passage of legislations beneficial to the program. 

5. Research

Researches in substance abuse shall be initiated and encouraged by the substance abuse prevention, treatment and rehabilitation centers in collaboration with DOH Essential National Health Research Program and Philippine Council for Health Research and Development. Technology transfer of research results shall likewise be promoted.
