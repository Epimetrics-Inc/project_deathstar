<subject>SUBJECT: Guidelines in the Prevention and Management of Iatrogenic and Post-Abortion Infections in DOH Retained Hospitals and Medical Centers</subject>

<body>

I. Background/Rationale 

With the rising global concern over the rise of Sexually transmitted infections (STI) and HIV/AIDS, the Department of Health has responded by prioritizing these and other reproductive tract infections. The DOH has redirected its strategies to focus on Reproductive Health, as a more holistic approach that will also address other Reproductive Tract Infections (RTI).

The Reproductive Tract Infection Program was created in 1999 by the DOH under the umbrella of Reproductive Health. This is the country’s response to its commitment as one of the signatories of the 1994 Cairo International Conference on Population Development (ICPD) and the 1995 4th World Conference on Women in Beijing.

Iatrogenic and Post—abortion Infections of the Reproductive Tract is one of the three components of the RTI Program, which also includes STI/HIV/AIDS and endogenous infections. Iatrogenic Infections are defined as those infections that result from medical procedures/ instrumentations such as pelvic examination, episiotomy/episiorrhapy, catheterization, dilation and curettage, IUD insertion and abortion performed by modern and traditional health providers. Post-abortion infections include those that are self—inflicted or inflicted by partners or any concerned individual, who is not a health provider in an effort to induce abortion. This group of clients is included to raise awareness of possible complications of induced abortion and ultimately decrease its incidence through counseling which is an integral part of these guidelines. 

Iatrogenic and post-abortion infections of the reproductive tract (IPIRT) particularly in women are often caused by a wide range of organisms and are usually polymicrobial. They are often associated with the lack of infection prevention and control at the time of the medical procedure or instrumentation. 

The provision therefore, of standard clinical guidelines in the prevention and management of the common iatrogenic and post-abortion infections of the reproductive tract, particularly among women will greatly assist in its prevention and management. This set of guidelines, which is the result of a series of consultative meetings with a group of experts, shall initially apply to DOH Retained Hospitals and Medical Centers.


II. Objectives 

General Objective: To establish a functional system that will enable the DOH regional hospitals/medical centers/specialty hospitals to prevent and manage IPIRT.

Specific Objectives: 

1. To create an IPIRT subcommittee under the Infection Control Committee (ICC) of the hospital.
2. To train hospital staff in infection prevention and in the management of iatrogenic and post-abortion infections.
3. To train hospital staff in counseling patients with IPIRT.
4. To record and report all cases of IPIRT. 
5. To provide appropriate care and management to patients with IPIRT.

III. Organizational Structure:

IV. Composition and Function of the Iatrogenic and Post-Abortion Infections of the Reproductive Tract (IPIRT) Subcommittee

All DOH-retained Hospitals and Medical Centers shall organize an (Iatrogenic and Post- abortion Infections of the Reproductive Tract (IRIRT) subcommittee, which shall be chaired by the  Chief, Medical Professional Staff (Chief of Clinics).

4. Chair, Department of Pathology;
5. Chief Nurse; and 
6. Administrative Officer.

The IPIRT subcommittee shall have primary responsibility of ensuring the implementation of the guidelines on the prevention and management of the iatrogenic and post-abortion infections  of the Reproductive Tract. The subcommittee shall work in close coordination with the other members of the Infection Control Committee of the hospital. The IPIRT subcommittee shall meet at least on a quarterly basis to discuss issues and problems related to the implementation of the guidelines. 

The IPIRT subcommittee shall have the following functions and activities:

1. Review existing hospital data to determine the common sources of IPIRT.
2. Ensure that hospital staff are trained on infection prevention, and on the management of common IPIRT.
3. Ensure the provision of counseling and health education services to patients.
3.1 Identify/train nurse/midwife that can provide compassionate, gender sensitive RH counseling.
3.2 Provide a private space for counseling that will ensure comfort and confidentiality.
4. Ensure that the hospital has the facilities, equipment and logistiCs that will enable it to
comply with the standards in infection prevention and in the management of IPIRT.
5 .Oversee the appropriate reporting and recording of cases.
6. Facilitate inter- and intra—departmental coordination within the hospital and networking with other hospitals and other health facilities. 
7. Develop a monitoring scheme to periodically assess the compliance to the guidelines.
8. Review/update guidelines to continuously improve management of IPIRT cases.

1.3 Post Intervention Pelvic Infection - spectrum of inflammatory disorders of the upper female genital tract including any combination of endometritis, salpingytis, tubo-ovarian abscess and pelvic peritonitis.
1.4, Catheter-associated urinary tract infection
