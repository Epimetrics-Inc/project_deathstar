<subject>SUBJECT: National Framework of the National Health Laboratory Network 
</subject>
<body>
I. BACKGROUND

The health laboratory is an integral part of the overall health care delivery system. The practice  of public health medicine and surgery over the years has become more complex and had increased the demands placed on the laboratories. The laboratories are often the major source of data In the rapid. 1ecognition and prevention of the spread of communicable diseases. They p1oduce elitical and relevant information fer patient care and treatment, epidemiology and surveillance. Hence. to optimize their utilization. the health laboratories shall be organized into a coordinated laboratory network. 

After the establishment of the Republic of the Philippines in 1946. public health laboratories were created at the regional and provincial. levels. These laboratories were placed under the supervision and control of the Bureau of Research and Laboratories (BRL). When the regional health laboratories Were integrated into the Regional Hospitals or Medical Centers in the 1970‘s and. the provincial health laboratories integrated into the Provincial hospitals in the 1980’s. the BRL lost. administrative authority and control over these laboratories. However. an Administrative Order was issued forming a network of laboratories at various levels in the Department of Health with the BRL exercising technical supervisioii over the network. 

When provincial and district hospitals were devolved to the provincial governments and rural health unitsand otherperipheralhealth services devolved to‘ the municipal governments in the 1990’s. the health laboratory network ceased to exist. In 2000, by virtue of E0 102— “Redirecting the Functions and Operations of the Department of Health,” the BRL was abolished and its personnel weIe deployed to hospital laboratories in the DOH. On one hand technical supervision and comdination of health laboratories disappeared and DOH no longer articulated and implemented a comprehensive and coherent national laboratory policy. 

With the loss of the Central Public Health Laboratory, some functions of the BRL were transferred to the six (6) designated National Reference. Laboratories (NRLs) for speciﬁc disease areas. These NRLs arethe National Kidney and 'I'Tansplant Institute (NKTI). Lung Center of the Philippines (LCP) Research Institute f01 Tropical Medicine (RlTM') East Avenue Medical Center (EAMC) STD— AIDS Central Cooperative Laboratory (SACCL)— San Lazaro Hospital and the Philippine Heart Center (PHC). 

However, since adequate resources were not provided the newly-designated NRLs were unable in varying degrees to carry-out their mandates and since they are still in the process of fully operationalizing and strengthening their capabilities. the mechanism for networking and collaboration from their level down to the municipal/rural level  has not yet been established. Furthermore mechanisms for referral of samples information/ data ﬂow feedback and consultation have to be developed and strengthened. 

In 2010,the WHO-WPRO transmitted a document entitled ‘“ Asia Pacific. Strategy for the Strengthening of Health Laboratories” which had been approved in the 2009 Western Pacific Regional Committee Meeting. Pursuant to the DOH‘s commitment a Task Force LABNET was tasked to formulate a Strategic Plan for the National Health Laboratory Network (NHLN). This provided the opportunity to realize a vision to establish a functional National Health Laboratory Network. 

This Administrative Order is issued to articulate the National Framework for the National Health Laboratory Network that will support the achievement of quality service and accessible health facilities which is one of the strategies of Universal Health Care (Kalusugan Pangkalahatan). The National Framework shall provide a road map or direction for strengthening and promoting the institutional and operational capacities of the health laboratories that will help improve their diagnostic surveillance and monitoring capabilities. This will be achieved by the implementation of the Strategichlan for the NHLN. 

II. OBJECTIVES The objectives of this Order shall comprise of the following: 

General: 

To provide a National Framework for the organization ofall government and private hospitals at all levels into a functional National Health Laboratory Network. Further, it shall provide guidance for the implementation of Strategic Plan of the National Health Laboratory Network. 

Specific : 

1. To establish national standards of laboratory services at all levels 

2. To institutionalize a Quality Management System in laboratory services to ensure high standards of performance and outcomes 

3. To obtain the commitment and support of the national and local governments for the organization and operation of efficient and sustainable laboratory services 

4. To define the ethical values in laboratory practice. including patient conﬁdentiality. adherence to codes of professional ethics and ethical norms for human research 

5. To encourage research for the improvement of the technical and management aspects oflaboratory services and

6. To establish efﬁcient and operational laboratory networks and referral mechanisms at the national. regional. provincial and peripheral levels ofthe health services 



III. SCOPE  

This National Framework of NHLN shall apply nationwide to all health and clinical laboratories at all levels. government and private. which are licensed or accredited by the DOH. All agencies (public and private. including donors) supporting the operation and management of health and clinical laboratories shall also be governed by this Order. ' 

IV. DEFINITION OF TERMS  


1. Clinical Laboratory - a facility where tests are done on specimens from the human body to obtain information about health status ofa patient for the prevention. diagnosis and treatment of diseases 

2. Health Laboratory -a facility in which tests are done on specimen from the human body. animals and other sources to obtain information about the status of health of a person or community or about factors or conditions that are related to health

3.Quality Assurance - is a set of planned and. systematic activities to provide confidence that a laboratory / organization fulﬁlls the requirements for quality 

4. National External Quality Assessment Survey (NEQAS) is quality assurance activity conducted by the National Reference Laboratories to assess the quality of performance and accuracy of test results of laboratories. The participating laboratories are given unknown samples for analysis and they are rated based on the closeness of their results to the pre- determined value or to the reference value


5. Standards in Quality Management System - are developmental standards formulated and adopted by the DOH which covers all aspects of laboratory operations and services to ensure quality performance and test results
