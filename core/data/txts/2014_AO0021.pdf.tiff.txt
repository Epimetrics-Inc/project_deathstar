I. RATIONALE/BACKGROUND

The Quirino Memorial Medical Center (QMMC), formerly known as Quirino Labor Hospital, was formally opened to the public as the ﬁrst government hospital in Quezon City with a 75 bed capacity on August 15, 1953. 

On. June 22, 1955 it was designated as teaching and training hospital per Department Order No. 3 and became the tertiary regional general hospital by virtue of Bates Pambansa Bilang 442. By August 15, 1964, the hospital was renamed to Quirino Memorial General Hospital (QMGH) by virtue of RA 3965. In 1986, by virtue of Executive Order 119, the hespital was renamed, “Quirino Memorial Medical Center” (QMMC) with 250 beds. 

Due to the increase in bed occupancy rate of 150% by 1997, the hospital’s bed capacity could no longer accommodate the increasing health needs of its primary catchment area, Quezon City. It had also accommodated patients from the neighboring cities and prOvinces. Thus, on March 17, 1997, Republic Act No. 8313, “An Act Upgrading the Quirino Memorial Medical Center, Appropriating Funds T herefor and for Other Purposes” which upgraded the bed capacity to 350 beds, was approved. 

The average occupancy rate of QMMC had increased to 268% during the period 2007-2012. At the same time QMMC had evolved as a' Level 4 (A0 No. 2007-0021) medical center catering to various catastrophic cases requiring highly specialized hospital services. This justiﬁed the enactment of Republic Act No. 10345, “An Act Increasing the Bed Capacity of Quirino Memorial Medical Center from Three Hundred Fifty (350) to Five Hundred (500) Beds, Amending for the Purpose Republic Act No. 8313, Appropriating Funds Therefo'r and for Other Purposes” on December 12, 2012. 

With Department Order 2011-0188 “Kalusugang Pangkahalatan Execution Plan and Implementation Arrangements”, the QMMC is mandated to provide universal health" care through its hospital services. Thus implementation of Republic Act 10345 responds to the provision of Section 15, Article II of the Philippine Constitution, which is “to protect and promote the right to health of the people and instill health consciousness I among them.“
