SUBJECT: Implementing Guidelines on the Rational Use of Medicines (RUM) Pillar of the Philippine Medicines Policy 
</subject>
<body>


I. RATIONALE 

The irrational use of medicines remains as one of the most crucial causes of unsuccessful treatment outcomes, health hazards and wastage of resources that lead to increased healthcare costs. 

The World Health Organization estimated that fifty per cent (50%) of medicines worldwide are prescribed, dispensed or sold inappropriately with half of all patients failing to take medicines correctly. In the Philippines, an analysis of the practices pertaining to the National Formulary and the rational use of medicines among healthcare providers and patients in government facilities revealed a similar situation (unpublished study, National Center for Pharmaceutical Access and Management, 2012). All of the facilities had a lack of supply of medicines that led to sub-optimal or failed treatment and irrational practices that were resorted to by the physicians when these were regarded as the better recourse or when the prescribed medicines were unavailable and the patients could not afford to buy them. A rampant practice is rationing, often termed as “dibydiby”, where limited stocks of medicines, including antibiotics, are divided among the patients needing them so that only a few days supply are given out with the rest prescribed. Other practices included dispensing whatever alternative medicines were available, prescribing maximum doses of antibiotics for longer periods of time when the ﬁrst-line antimicrobials were unavailable, and irrational combination of medicines. The inadequate supply of medicines was mainly due to the vast number of indigent patients seeking medical attention or the poor support from the government officials and inadequate fund allocation for health which many perceived was not a priority of the elected officials. 

The substandard quality of many generic medicines supplied to the rural and city health units contributed to suboptimal treatment and further eroded the physicians conﬁdence in using them. Among the patients, poverty continued to be the main driving force that led to the practice of buying medicines piecemeal (“tingi") that 13 allowed in many pharmacies, inappropriate self—medication, and failure to buy or complete required doses of the medicines. Other problems included high cost of medicines, operational inefficiencies, limitations inherent in the formulary, geographical isolation, corruption and political mendicancy, and poor health literacy of patients and some healthcare providers. Irrational practices that include inappropriate polypharmacy, mis—use of antibiotics leading to antimicrobial resistance, over—use of over—the—counter medicines, and “shotgun” therapy are likewise encountered among private practitioners and consumers in the country. Moreover, the adverse consequences of the extensive use of antimicrobials in the treatment of diseases in animals, particularly poultry and livestock, and the unrestrained addition of these and other medicines in animal feeds to promote growth extend to human health. All these underscore the need to promptly address the barriers to the rational use of medicines (RUM) in the country. 



Integrating the rational and responsible use of medicines into the healthcare system will ensure that only the most necessary and scientiﬁcally proven efﬁcacious and cost—effective medicines are utilized in situations where there are clear and valid indications for them. The need, then, to develop a comprehensive conceptual framework of the National Plan of the RUM arises. This framework will set the approach to the formulation of guiding principles and key strategies that will support and be harmonized with existing policies from different sectors to achieve both the optimum therapeutic outcomes in the use of medicines and the economic objectives thereof. 

II. OBJECTIVES 

A. General Objective 

This issuance sets the guidelines that aim to institutionalize the rational use of medicines towards optimal health outcomes in all sectors. 

B. Speciﬁc Objectives 

This issuance aims to: 

1. ensure active involvement of all stakeholders in promoting the rational and responsible use of medicines; and 

2. identify the target-speciﬁc strategies that will address the problems encountered in the practice of RUM.

D. Antimicrobial Resistance (AMR) refers to the resistance of a microorganism (including bacteria, viruses and some parasites) to an antibiotic to which it was previously sensitive. AMR which is a- consequence of the use or misuse of an antimicrobial agent develops when a microorganism mutates or acquires a resistance gene. Resistant organisms withstand attack by antimicrobial or anti parasitic agents so that standard treatments become ineffective, allowing infections to persist and spread. 

E. Consumer refers to a natural person who is a purchaser, lessee, or recipient or prospective purchaser, lessee or recipient of health consumer products, services or credit.

This replaces the previous name of the committee, i.e. Drugs and Therapeutic Committee. 

Q. Philippine Medicines Policy is the framework that provides the directions for improving access to essential medicines by all Filipinos in all levels of health care at all. times. This incorporates the principles embodied in the SARAH Medicines Access Framework that refers to these ﬁve complementary pillars: Safety, efﬁcacy and quality; Affordability and availability; Rational Use of Medicines; Accountability, transparency and good governance; and Health system support.
