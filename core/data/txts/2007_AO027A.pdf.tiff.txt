<subject>SUBJECT: Amendment to Administrative Order No. 2007 - 0027 “Revised Rules and Regulations Governing the Licensure and Regulation of Clinical Laboratories in the Philippines”</subject>


<body>

One major public health problem is the alarming rate of drug resistance to tuberculosis (TB). Multidrug Resistance Tuberculosis (MDR—TB) is an obstacle to the effective control and eradication of TB. Hence, isolation and identification of the organism through culture is indispensable in treating MDR-TB.

The National Tuberculosis Reference Laboratory (NTRL) as the laboratory arm of the National Tuberculosis Control Program (NTP) of the Department of Health will be intensifying its activities to develop quality assured sputum culture centers across the country. This is embodied in Administrative Order No. 2008 — 0018 “Guidelines in the Programmatic Management of Drug Resistant Tuberculosis".

In line with the above, Section III of Administrative Order” No. 2007 — 0027 “Revised Rules and Regulations Governing Licensure and Regulation of Clinical Laboratories in the Philippines” is hereby amended to exempt the NTRL and its regional TB Reference Laboratories performing TB culture from securing a license to operate a clinical laboratory provided they adhere to program policies and international standards and requirements as a National Reference Laboratory.

This Order shall take effect immediately.
