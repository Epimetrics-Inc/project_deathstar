TO: Heads and Representatives of all Funding Agencies

<subject>SUBJECT: Coordinated allocation and use of resources provided by the donor community (USAID, U.N. System (UNDP, UNFPA, WHO, UNICEF, ILO), WORLD BANK, Asian Development Bank (ADB), AUSTRALIA (AusAID), Germany (GTZ and KfW), Japan (JICA, JOICFP), IPPF, EUROPEAN UNION (EEC) and all Other Assistance Agencies, bilateral and multi-lateral) to the Philippine FP Program including Women’s Health, Safe Motherhood, Reproductive Health, Health and Nutrition Program with FP component and other FP—related Programs and Projects</subject>


<body>

To ensure that the best interest of the government of the Philippines and the donor agency is served at all times, it is necessary that both parties continually work in harmony. To facilitate attaining this relationship, it is essential that both government and donor cooperate and collaborate with each other at all times. One very important aspect of this relationship involves resources.

To enable my Office to be on top of all situations, all forms of assistance provided to the Program by all external agencies referred to in above subject will have to be known and agreed to by the undersigned. In case such resources are already covered by earlier agreements that are still in force, its allocation, use and accountability shall have to be reviewed jointly by my Ofﬁce and the donor concerned. A composite strategic management staff will be organized in due course from existing personnel to help monitor the planning, allocation and use of these resources as well as evaluate performance of various externally funded programs, projects and activities.

I hereby designate Dr. Rafael A. Esmundo to help me oversee, coordinate and manage the day-to-day relationship with the external donor community, the resources they provide to government, its partner agencies (LGUs, other government ofﬁces and NGOs), the Program as well as the corresponding projects and programs of these donors. As such, Dr. Esmundo shall report to and receive instructions directly from me. 

All concerned are earnestly enjoined to cooperate with and support me and DOH in this effort to maximize the benefits of this assistance.

This Order takes effect immediately.
