<subject>SUBJECT: Guidelines for Rapid Coverage Assessment and ReportingPerformance on “Ligtas Tigdas 2004”</subject>


<body>

In view of the Ligtas Tigdas 2004 vaccination campaign per Executive Order 237 s. 2003, a rapid coverage assessment shall be conducted to measure performance. Speciﬁcally this shall:

a. compare assessment coverage with reported accomplishment;
b. identify areas where there are missed children and
c. take immediate actions to vaccinate missed children.

This Order is issued to detail out guidelines and speciﬁc procedures. 

A. Rapid Immunization Coverage Assessment

The duly designated and trained regional, provincial or city monitoring teams shall perform the validation procedures.

Validation shall be done at least once in all barangays in the cities, town proper and well—populated communities. In municipalities, all barangays in the poblaeion and at least 2 barangays with highest and low accomplishment report must be covered.

Validation is preferably barangay—wide, but can be done by sitio or by purok in big barangays.

At least one repeat validation shall be done in all areas that are found to have less than 95% coverage by the validation method.

The following shall be the procedure of validation:

1. Plan the validation. Assign validation/monitoring teams and schedule the validation based on the schedule of completion of vaccination in the barangay. Do not validate in areas that have not been fully covered by the vaccination teams.

2. Look at the Accomplishment Report of the City/Municipality/Barangay. Select areas with high and low reported measles immunization coverage for your sample. Ask for identified high risk areas especially populated/densely populated areas.

3. Using the barangay spot map, identify four validation sites in each barangay to be validated: two (2) sites remote from general access (e.g. borders with other barangays, riverside, houses away from main roads) and two (2) central sites (e.g. slum areas around the market or railroad, houses along the main road or railroad). Select all sites away from the health center.

4. Go to the selected sites one at a time and fill up the attached validation form (Rapid Assessment of Immunization Coverage of the “ Ligtas Tigdas 2004” using the Grab Sample and Door Sample Techniques).

Grab Sample: Grab at least 5 eligible children (9 months to &lt;8 years old) who are found in the streets in each selected sites. Determine their vaccination status by looking at their ﬁngers and at their vaccination site. (The importance of immediate 1-2 days after validation is to ensure that at least the vaccination puncture is still visible). Make sure that there are 20 children in the grab sample.

Door Sample: Identify 5 doors (e.g. house, condominium, school, etc.) nearest to the selected site. If there is a variety, select at least two (2) doors of the hardest to reach doors (e.g. top floor or ones with complicated entry. Determine if the marking on the door correctly matches with vaccination status of all the children in the selected doors. Make sure that 20 doors are seen in sample sites.

5. Based on the summary of ﬁndings at the bottom of the validation form, determine the appropriate action for the barangay.

Action to be taken:

Findings A: If the ﬁndings show that all grabbed children have been vaccinated and that all doors are correctly labeled but there were still doors marked “X”, the validation/monitoring team shall remind the vaccination team to revisit the “X” door immediately to vaccinate the missed children.

The validation/monitoring team shall also revisit these “X” doors to ensure that circles have been placed around the “X”, corresponding to completion of vaccination of previously missed children.

If the validation/monitoring team brought measles vaccines with them, they may instead vaccinate the missed children themselves, encircle the “X” on the door and submit the vaccination report to the appropriate vaccination team.

Findings B: if the findings show that there is at least one unmarked door or a door marked with a circle but with an unvaccinated eligible child, this means that, most probably, there are many more missed children in the area. The validation/monitoring team shall correct the labels on the doors (mark the doors “X”) and immediately —— the same day, if possible — discuss their findings with the appropriate vaccination team to elicit their commitment to revisit the barangay and do a door~to—door search for, and vaccinate, other children who might have been missed, and ensure 100% coverage.

As above, if the validationtmonitoring team brought measles vaccines with them, they may also vaccinate the missed children themselves, appropriately marked the doors and submit the vaccination report to the appropriate vaccination team. The door-to-door search. for additional missed children should still be conducted even if these missed children have already been vaccinated by the validation/monitoring teams.

The validation/monitoring team shall follow-up to check that the door-to-door search is actually conducted. They shall also, as much as possible, repeat the validation in these areas.

Compile barangay validation ﬁndings for each municipality/city: Validation Summary Form.

Continue the cycle of “vaccination - validation — search for missed children — vaccination” until there is not a single missed eligible child in any city, town proper or well-populated community.

B. Reiteration of Functions of National/Regional, Provincial and City Health Staff

Pursuant to Sec. 9 of the Guide to Ligtas Tigdas 2004, the DOl-l National/ Regional staff (including DOH representatives) as well as the Ligtas Tigdas teams at the provincial city and municipal health ofﬁces shall do the following:

1. Ensure that the door—to—door strategy is strictly followed in ALL cities, town proper and well—populated communities. This means that door—to-door vaccination shall start immediately in the morning and shall be continued until the doors targeted for the day are completed. This is to ensure 100% immunization coverage.

To ensure the correctness of the door-to-door procedures, the above-named health staff shall monitor vaccination activities closely and institute immediate corrective measures whenever necessary.

2. Train and supervise validation/monitoring teams and conduct rapid assessment of immunization coverage according to the guidelines mentioned above, provide feedback and advocate to Local Chief Executives (LCEs) on ensuring 100% immunization coverage.

3. Mobilize resources — human, ﬁnancial, material, etc. — to ensure the successful implementation of the campaign. If necessary, they shall provide vaccinators teams from their own health staff. This shall also include full support for travel and communication of the vaccination and monitoring teams.

4. Prioritize vaccination efforts where unvaccinated children are likely to reside. Many implementers are placing undue energy to reach a few children who are most likely immunized (e.g., with MMR) while there are many more missed unvaccinated children who live in neighboring depressed barangays.

5. Ensure that the ﬁeld vaccination teams of the appropriate barangays utilize the list of children missed in school and day care center vaccinations as their guide when they do the community level vaccinations so that these children are vaccinated at home outside of school hours.

6. Coordinate more closely with pediatricians and other private practitioners so that they strongly encourage their clients to have their children vaccinated. Pediatricians may be allowed to vaccinate their own patients, if necessary.

7. Strengthen the command posts at all levels — region, province, city, municipality, barangay -— by ensuring that they comply with all relevant guidelines and procedures and that they are fully provided with apprOpriate support systems and resources.

Reporting of Performance:

Because of issues of overestimate/underestimate of population, the following are the supplemental guidelines on reporting Ligtas Tigdas 2004 performance:

1. The method of calculation of performance in the Ligtas Tigdas 2004 shall be as follows:
In areas reporting number of children vaccinated exceeding the estimated target eligible children:

Vaccination Coverage = Number of eligible children vaccinated / (No. of eligible children vaccinated + missed children)

In areas reporting number of children vaccinated not exceeding the estimated target eligible children:

Vaccination Coverage = Number of eligible children vaccinated / (Number of eligible children vaccinated + missed children)

(if this denominator is higher than the estimated target of eligible children)

OR

Vaccination Coverage = Number of eligible children vaccinated / Number of target eligible children vaccinated

(If the estimate is higher than the total of vaccinated and missed children)

2. In addition to the information required in the Guide to Ligtas Tigdas 2004 Section 10 on Recording and Reporting, the following shall also be reported as agreed upon during the follow-up consultative meeting with the Regional EPI Coordinators to the DOH Regional “Ligtas Tigdas “ Command Post:

a. Daily — number of children immunized, children missed, children given vitamin A

b. Weekly summary of validation of coverage (by municipality/city)

3. In analyzing performance, information on whether proper door—to-door procedures were done or not shall also be considered.

This Order takes effect immediately.

Instructions

After having selected a Barangay for conducting a coverage assessment:

1. Use the Barangay map to identify 2 sites remote from general access (e.g., riverside, bordering other Barangay, away from roads) and 2 central sites (a total of 4 sites)

2. Go to the first side identified on the map.

3. Briefly describe the site on the table (e.g., riverside, bordering other Barangay, along road)

4. Identify the nearest childern to the site

5. Determine the vaccination status, age and gender of each child and determine their eligibility (i.e., age 9-95 months)

6. Complete one line for each eligible child in the section of the table labeled "Grab Sample"

7. Identify 5 doors nearest to the site. If there is a variety select at least a couple of the hardest to reach doors. E.g. the top floor, or ones with complicated entry.

8. Complete one line of the table for each door:
Question 1: Was the house marked with chalk?
Question 2: Was the house marked with a "O", "X", or "Ⓧ"?
Knock on the door. If there is someone present, ask the following questions.
Question 3: How many children 9-95 months stay here?
Question 4: How many of these children were vaccinated during the campaign against measles?
Question 5: Why were the children not vaccinated?
Question 6: Was this house marked correctly? NB. Unlabeled houses are not completely marked.

9. Repeat steps 2-8 until all four sites add have been completed.

10. After completion of the 4 sites add up the columns as indicated in the bottom row.

1.. If there is one child missed either in the grab sample or on knocking on doors; or there is one door that is not completed or missed, indicate to the vaccination team supervisor that the area needs to be redone.
