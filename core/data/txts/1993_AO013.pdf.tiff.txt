<subject>Subject: Procedures for coordinating legislative action within the DOH and for formulating timely responses to proposed and pending legislation</subject>

<body>
Principal responsibility for legislative action rests with the Secretary of Health and the Undersecretary and Chief of Staff with support from the following organizational entities:

* Departmental Legislative Liaison Office (DLLO): established by Executive Order in every Department, the DLLO must advocate for a DOH legislative agenda with the Executive Branch, and track legislation in the Congress.

* Health Policy Development Staff (HPDS): coordinates development of the DOH policy and legislative agenda, and coordinates DOH response to legislative initiatives emanating from Congress. It will also take a proactive approach toward developing the policy analysis capacities of the other entities involved in the DOH legislative process.

* DOH Technical Services/Regional Health Offices: provide technical input into DOH legislative and policy agenda, and technical input to DOH response to legislative initiatives emanating from Congress, and make appearances before Congressional Committees.

To systematize and facilitate DOH responses to legislative actions, the following process shall be established and maintained.

I. Legislative Actions Initiated by the DOH

The DOH will take a proactive approach toward issues requiring legislative actions, using the process proposed below:

1. The DOH will develop and maintain a dynamic and evolving legislative agenda which contains the priority DOH policy issues requiring legislative action. Technical input required for formulation of the legislative agenda will be sought from the DOH technical services and the DOH Regional Health Offices. The HPDS will coordinate and facilitate the process for development of the Legislative Agenda.

2. Once a legislative agenda has been adopted, the DLLO will be responsible for advocating for Executive Branch sponsorship of the legislative agenda.

II. Legislative Actions Emanating from Congress

There are numerous legislative actions emanating from Congress which require DOH reactions and responses. This will require a process which is reactive in a timely fashion. A process for reactive response in Congressional legislative initiatives is described below:

1. The DLLO will monitor and track legislative initiatives from Congress which impact the health sector. As DOH responses are required the DLLO will refer these to the USEC/COS.

2. The USEC/COS, with staff support from the HPDS will request technical input and/or attendance at Congressional hearings from the appropriate Technical Service or Regional Health Office. In instances where technical input must be sought outside the DOH, the HPDS will coordinate obtaining input from external sources.

3. Once technical input has been obtained from either DOH Technical Services, Regional Health Offices, or external sources, the USEC/COS, with staff support from the HPDS, will consolidate the responses into a DOH position paper through a consultative process and forward it to the Congress through the DLLO with copies furnished to the concerned Technical Service/Regional Health Office. DOH personnel from the Technical Services or regional Health Offices will be requested to appear at Congressional Hearings.

4. The DLLO will monitor the responses once they have been sent back to Congress and will accompany DOH Staff at Congressional Hearings.

A flow chart and a detailed description of the system for formulating DOH responses to proposed and pending legislation is enclosed as an Annex 1 to this Administrative Order.

The Regional Health Offices shall designate a Regional Policy and Legislative Coordinator with the following responsibilities:

* liaise with the HPDS on all DOH policy and legislative issues.
* formulate a regional legislative agenda and initiate regional level policy actions
* liaise with local congressman in the region
* liaise with the Local Government/NGO Community Assistance Division in the RHO regarding municipal and provincial legislative initiatives.

This order shall take effect immediately.

ANNEX 1

SYSTEM FOR DOH RESPONSE TO PROPOSED AND PENDING LEGISLATION

(1) Legislation relevant to DOH goals, whether being reviewed in the Committee on Health or other Congressional Committees, is identified by the Departmental Legislative Liaison Office (DLLO) representative in the House or the Senate; or referred to the USEC/COS through the DLLO.

(2) DLLO will prepare and send a form letter, signed by the USEC/COS, to the relevant Technical Service/RHO requesting preparation of a DOH position paper on the legislation. A copy of the request is sent to the HPDS. A copy of the form letter appears as ANNEX 1. An outline for the position paper appears as ANNEX 2.

(3) HPDS will decide whether the request for comments/position paper should be sent to other Technical Services/RHOs, and whether it should be sent to other external agencies, such as NGOs or universities, for further comment.

(4) Comments and position papers will be submitted by the Technical Services/RHOS and External Agencies to the HPDS, which will be responsible for their consolidation into a DOH Position Paper. A copy of the comments or position papers will be furnished to the DLLO.

(5) HPDS will conduct the necessary consultations with the Technical Services/RHOs and external Agencies required to synthesize comments into a coherent position paper, and will submit the draft position paper to the USEC/COS and the Secretary.

(6) Secretary of Health and the USEC/COS will review the position paper with technical input from the HPDS, DLLO, and the relevant technical service/RHO, or external agencies. Comments from this review will be incorporated into the position paper by the HPDS, which will produce a final DOH position paper on the legislation.

(7) Secretary of Health will submit the formal DOH position paper to Congress through the DLLO.

(8) Secretary of Health or his designee will appear before Congress to respond to Congressional inquiries, accompanied by the Service Director from the relevant Technical Service/RHO.
