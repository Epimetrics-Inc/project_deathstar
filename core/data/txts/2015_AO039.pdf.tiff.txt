<body>

I. BACKGROUND 

The Philippines is a disaster-prone country and is listed as No. 4 among countries with reported events, and among those that appear prominently in the list of countries experiencing the highest number of natural disaster events. .In the 2013 Annual Statistical Disaster Review published by the WHO—Collaborating Center for Research on the Epidemiology of Disasters (CRED), it ranked no. 1 in terms of disaster mortality and affected population. for the same year. According to the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration (PAGASA), the country lies within the Ring of Fire, making it vulnerable to volcanic eruptions and earthquakes. It is also visited by an average of 22 typhoons annually that result in ﬂoods and landslides. The devastation from Typhoons 0ndoy (International name: Ketsana, 2009) and Pablo (International name: Bopha, 2012), as well as the recent 7.2 magnitude earthquake that hit the Visayas just before Super Typhoon Yolanda (International name: Haiyan, 2013) wreaked havoc in the same region, highlighting the disaster-proneness of the country. It also suffers from human-made emergencies like ﬁres and civic conﬂicts, such as the siege of Zamboanga City in 2013. 

Disasters cause population displacements and disruptions in the delivery of basic services, including health. Population displacements, crowded and poorly-ventilated evacuation centers, limited access to water, sanitation facilities and optimum nutrition — all these increase the risk for transmission and worsening of diseases under these conditions, including tuberculosis. Disasters also make health workers victims themselves, thereby hampering the delivery of services. For this reason, the Department of Health (DOH) issued a series of Administrative Orders promulgating policies and guidelines on how to manage disease control in general in times of emergencies and disasters from preparedness, response and recovery. 

These include Administrative Order No. 168- -s..2004 known. as the National Policy on Health Emergencies and Disasters which states that the National Center for Disease Prevention and Control (NCDPC) is tasked to develop guidelines on the management of infectious diseases in times of emergencies and disasters. Examples of these are the “Philippine Preparedness and Response Plan for Pandemic and Avian Inﬂuenza” and the “Interim Guidelines for Preparedness and Response to MERS—CoV.” Furthermore, the ofﬁce of the President issued Executive Order 168 creating the inter—agency task force for the management of emerging infectious diseases in the Philippines; one of these is the Multi-Drug Resistant Tuberculosis (MDRTB). 

Following the occurrence of the Typhoon Yolanda in November 2013, the National Tuberculosis Control Program (N TP) of the DOH facilitated the issuance of Department Memorandum No. 2013-0347 entitled “Guidelines in the Provision of TB services to Post-disaster Areas affected by Super Typhoon Yolanda.” However, these guidelines focused only on the response phase and did not elaborate on how the guidelines relate with the overall DOH policies and implementing structures in terms of human resources, coordination, recording and reporting, logistics management, resource mobilization, information and education and communication (IEC) and advocacy campaigns. Neither did they reﬂect how they would be related with the country” 5 National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Framework (NDRRMF). 

Persons affected by disasters are one of the priority vulnerable groups of the NTP as enunciated in the updated 2010-2016 Philippine Plan to Control Tuberculosis (PhilPACT) and the 5th edition of the NTP Manual of Procedures (MOP). Thus, there is a need for new guidelines on ensuring the provision of TB services to reduce TB morbidity and mortality in times of emergencies and disasters. 

II. OBJECTIVES 

A. To provide policies and guidelines for TB control before, during and after emergencies especially for the ﬁ'ontline health service providers at the LGU level. 

B. To deﬁne the roles and responsibilities of the various organizations/agencies involved in the provision of TB services in the various phases of disaster risk reduction and management. 

C. To describe the monitoring and evaluation mechanism of this guideline. 

III. SCOPE AND COVERAGE 

This Order is issued to provide guidelines to all DOH ofﬁces, bureaus, national centers, regional ofﬁces, DOH health facilities, attached agencies, local government units, other government agencies, non-government organizations, professional societies, private sector, non-government organizations, and development partners in managing tuberculosis during disaster and emergencies. 

IV. DEFINITION OF TERMS 

Case Finding — is the identiﬁcation and diagnosis of TB cases among individuals with signs and symptoms presumptive of tuberculosis 

Case Holding — is the set of procedures which ensures that patients complete their treatment 

Disaster — any event in which local emergency management measures were insufﬁcient to cope with a hazard, whether due to lack of time, capacity or resources, resulting in unacceptable levels of damage or numbers of casualties. 

Directly Observed Treatment Short-course (DOTS) Facility —— a health care facility, whether public or private, that provides TB DOTS services in accordance with the policies and guidelines of the NTP. 

Emergency —— any public health situation endangering the life or health of a signiﬁcant number of people and demanding immediate action. An emergency situation may result from a natural, human- generated, technological or societal hazard. 

Preparedness — measures taken to strengthen the capacity of the emergency services to respond in an emergency. Emergency preparedness is done at all levels while disaster preparedness is focused mostly at the national level. 

Presumptive TB — any person whether adult or child with signs and/or symptoms suggestive of TB whether pulmonary or extra—pulmonary, or those with CXR ﬁndings suggestive of active TB. 

Recovery — refers to the coordinated process of supporting disaster—affected communities in reconstruction of physical infrastructure and restoration of emotional, social, economic and physical well—being. 

Response — the provisions of emergency services and public assistance during or immediately after a disaster to save lives, reduce health impacts, ensure public safety and meet the basic subsistence needs of the people affected. Disaster response is predominantly focused on immediate and short— term needs and is sometimes called “disaster relief”. 

Risk — the level of loss or damage that can be predicted to result from a particular hazard affecting a particular place at a particular time. 

Risk Management —— a comprehensive strategy for reducing risks to public safety by preventing exposure to hazards, reducing vulnerabilities and enhancing preparedness i.e. response capacities. 

V. GENERAL GUIDELINES 

A. Prevention and control of TB in disasters shall be a component of the National Tuberculosis Control Program (NTP) with a resource allocation for all phases—-preparedness, response, and recovery. 

B. NTP implementation during disaster situations shall be managed within the framework of the Philippines National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Framework (NDRRMF) and the DOH Health Emergency Management Preparedness and Response Framework.
