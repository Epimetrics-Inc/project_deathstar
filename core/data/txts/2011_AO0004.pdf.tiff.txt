<body>
I. RATIONALE 

The Philippine Cancer Society in 2004 revealed that the Philippines has an estimate of 73,944 new cancer cases annually. The top ten cancer sites are lung (23%); breast (19%); colon and rectum (12%); liver (10%); uterine cervix(10%); prostate(6%); blood (leukemia 6%); stomach(5%); thyroid(5%) and ovary (4%). In the Philippines, the relief and management of cancer pain and palliative care are benchmarked on the World Health Organization‘s Three-Step Ladder of Cancer Pain Management and the dispensing of _ morphine to Filipino cancer patients has been in existence for years through the Philippine Cancer Pain Control Program of this Department. According to the Pain Society of the Philippines an estimated 50% of patients with cancer requiring pain management remains under-treated due to high cost, poor access to narcotic pain medications, lack of knowledge/acceptance of the program by prescribing professionals, restrictive laws, regulations, policies and “opiophobia” - failure to administer legitimate opioid analgesic because of a fear of the power of these drugs to produce addiction. The World Health Organization reported that the Philippines has an estimated need of 5.3 mg/capita, but has an actual consumption of only 0.23, and has only been able to cover 4.4% of the estimated analgesic (opioid) requirement in the country in 2005. The International Narcotics Control Board (INCB, 2008) reported that the morphine requirement of the Philippines for pain and palliative care amounts to 30 kg but the country was able to procure 5-6 kg only. 

lnthe late 1980's, the DOH. through the Philippine Cancer Control Program, procured eight million pesos (P 8M) worth of morphine annually for the indigent cancer (both adult and pediatric) cases. Hospice facilities were the major distribution sites. The annual subsidy for the procurement of morphine in the course of time gradually decreased until the Department of Health stopped the purchase and distribUtion of such pain medications for indigent cases. The use of morphine in pain management and palliative care however, needs to be pursued. Cognizant of this and in an effort to reverse the situation, the Department of Health in 2008 initiated the procurement of P1 1M worth of morphine sulfate for distribution nationwide. Around 500,000 of the 10mg tablets, and 121,250 of the 30 mg morphine sulfate tablets, will be distributed at no cost to indigent cancer patients with moderate to severe pain. 



II. STATEMENT OF POLICY 

a. All indigent patients, whether out-patient or in—patient, requiring palliative medications, suffering from moderate to severe pain due to cancer, HIV and other diseases, shall receive pain medications (morphine sulfate) at no expense to them, upon presentation of the DOH Prescription Forms indicating the quantity and dosage requirement. Such patients shall include those in the DSWD list under the National Household Targeting System, those with PhilHealth cards indicating Sponsored Program Members and those outside of the above but evaluated by the hospital and or hospice care resident Social Worker. 

b. Hospitals shall only allocate a maximum of 20% of the existing stocks of morphine to non-indigent patients but without prejudice to indigent client needs and while supplies are available. 

c. Hospice facilities can also refer patients for pain management to distributing hospitals who shall provide the drug upon presentation of the DOH Prescription Form. 

d. Morphine sulfate medications shall be distributed by all DOH hospitals, participating Local Government Hospitals, private hospitals and hospice facilities. 

e. Services which are not medically necessary, such as cosmetic surgery and other non- palliative interventions shall not be eligible to receive free morphine sulfate. 

f. Consistent with the National Insurance Act of 1995 and the Health Sector "Reform Agenda. all Filipinos shall be encouraged to become members of the Philippine Health insurance (PhilHealth) or at least be a dependent of an active member.
