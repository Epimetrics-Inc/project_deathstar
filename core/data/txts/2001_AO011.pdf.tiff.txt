<subject>SUBJECT: Supplemental Guidelines for the Processing of Clearance for Information Technology Materials and Equipment for Repair</subject>

<body>

I. Rationale

It has been observed that difficulties in the payment processing of repaired Information Technology materials and equipment arise because of the lack of explicit procedural guidelines with which to traverse in granting pre- and post-repair inspection clearance. Further, operational delays and the issuance of notice of suspensions/disallowances by the Commission on Audit to seemingly anomalous repairs were ascribed to such mere procedural ﬂaw.

Considering that it is embodied in provision 9.1 of the Administrative Order No. 14-b. s.1997 that two units within the DOH are jointly reSponsible in theprocessing of the said clearance, namely the Management Advisory Service-the precursor of the InformationManagement Service (IMS), and the General Services Division, Administrative Service (GSD-AS), the scope and limitation of the units in their procedural involvement should be clearly defined and established to avoid the said predicament.

II. Objective

This Order is hereby created for the following objectives:

1. To provide supplemental guidelines and procedural ﬂow for the Pre— and Pest—Repair Inspection of IT Materials/Services;
2. To provide a well defined authority and responsibility for units concerned;
3. To adhere and implement existing accounting and auditing rules and regulations; and
4. To pre-empt the occurrence of delays and the iSsuance of Notice of Suspensions/Disallowances.

III. Guidelines

1. All Information Technology equipment for repair shall be subjected. to inspection and testing that shall be jointly conducted by the Information Management Service and the General Services Division before and after their repair. The report emanating from such process shall be noted by the Chief of GSD.
2. No payment processing shall ensue for repairs done without the appropriate attachment of Pre- and Post repair Inspection Report.
3. The Chief of the GSD shall act as the ex officio Head of the Inspection Unit for IT materials intended for Outside repair. The staff of GSD and selected technical experts from the IMS shall assist in the Conduct of the inspection and the preparation of the corresponding report.
