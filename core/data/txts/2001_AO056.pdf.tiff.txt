<subject>SUBJECT: GUIDELINE ON LABELING AND ADVERTISEMENT OF CIGARETTES, AND DESIGNATING THE BUREAU OF FOOD AND DRUGS AS ITS REGULATING AGENCY</subject>

<body>
The Secretary of Health, pursuant to Administrative Order No 10 s 1993 has issued Rules and Regulations on Labeling and Advertisement of Cigarette. Section 5 of this AO has been modiﬁed by decision of the Court of Appeals dated Feb 10,2000 and affirmed by the Supreme Court resolution last Feb.5,2001 thereby omitting the phrase “Secretary of Health” from the statement “Secretary of Health’s Warning: Cigarette Smoking is Dangerous to Your Health”. As modiﬁed thereof, it reads as follows:

“Section 5. The package of all cigarettes for sale or distribution within the country shall bear the statement:

WARNING: CIGARETTE SMOKING IS DANGEROUS TO HEALTH:”

f. The warning statement shall be located on the lower portion of the front and back of the principal display panel of the cigarette pack

g. The warning statement shall be of black color in type-size letters of bold Helvetica, not less than 3mm. on the standard size cigarette packs of about 10cm. in length, and shall be enclosed by an outlined box of the same black color on a rectangular white background not less than 25% of the area of the front and back principal panels.

An illustration of the requirement is hereto attached as “Appendix A”

h. The Filipino equivalent of the warning statement (as modiﬁed) may be used, which shall read:

“BABALA: ANG PANINIGARILYO AY MAPANGANIB SA KALUSUGAN.”

i. The word ‘package” referred to, here shall include the primary cigarette pack, the carton containing the packs( reams) as well as the equivalent containers for cigars.

j. Prototype labels containing the above warning shall be submitted to BFAD for approval prior to ﬁnal printing”

The Bureau of Food and Drugs as stated therein is the lead DOH agency for the implementation of this order and therefore also tasked to coordinate with the Department of Trade and Industry and other concerned agencies to ensure compliance to/or implementation of this Administrative Order.

For immediate compliance.
