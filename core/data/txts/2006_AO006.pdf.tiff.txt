AUTONOMOUS REGION FOR MUSLIM MINDANAO
2006-002

<subject>SUBJECT: Implementation Guidelines of the Technical Assistance Packages in support to the ARMM Strategy for Health Improvement (ASHI)</subject>


<body> 

I. BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE

Over the past 15 years, the Department of Health - Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao (DOH-ARMM) has endeavored to face the challenges of bringing quality health services to its constituency. Health status in ARMM is generally poor as reflected in the current health indices. The DOH-ARMM has been struggling to meet the requirements to bring up the standards of quality health care delivery in the Region. These main concerns are the poor performance in the health care delivery system as well as the problems in maintaining the mandate of providing the much-needed technical and management support systems to the Local Government Units (LGUs). ARMM is working on a non-devolved political system where Local Chief Executives (LCEs) and local leaders are not mandated to take responsibility or provide support in the management and implementation of the different health programs in the communities (except in the new province of Basilan, and Marawi City). There is a great need to strengthen partnerships and improve on the collaborative efforts between the DOH—ARMM and the LGUs in responding to the health needs of the communities in ARMM.

An in-depth study of the magnitude of problems confronting the ARMM Region resulted in a significant milestone in 2004: The ARMM Strategy for Health Improvement (ASHI). This strategy was concretized and is a product of a collaborative endeavor involving several researchers, donors, government agencies and non-government organizations (NGOs) focusing on the health situation in ARMM. A series of extensive consultations with several program stakeholders in the region: National DOH, DOH-ARMM, PhilHealth Insurance Corporation (Philhealth), LGUs, health workers, NGOs and partners including the National Economic and Development Authority (ARMM- Regional Planning & Development Office) resulted in the battle cry “SIHHAH LILJAMIE” (Health for All) that was presented on February 10, 2005 during the ARMM Health Summit to launch the health improvement strategy for ARMM.

As a manifestation of its commitment to the ASHI vision and mission, the DOH and other national government line agencies convened in a national workshop held on May 10, 2005 entitled “National Health Assistance Package for ARMM”. The purpose of this workshop was to define the specific technical assistance that will be provided in support to the ASHI objectives.

This Order provides the guidelines and specific descriptions of the technical support that the national DOH will provide to the identified health needs at the level of DOH—ARMM and the Local Government Units (Province, City, Municipality) and includes the agreements made between the two institutions with the end goal of sustainable development achievement ofdesired family size and improved health outcomes in ARMM.

II. GOALS AND OBJECTIVES

III. COVERAGE

This Order shall apply to all Bureaus/Offices/Centers within the DOH system and the DOH-ARMM.

IV. GENERAL GUIDELINES

A. In line with the Department of Health’s thrust towards improving the health sector performance, the ASHI envisions to carry through Improvements to the current health service delivery system through well defined specific output packages. While the ARMM Region is quite distinct in its being non—devolved (except in Basilan province and Marawi City), nevertheless the strategies and interventions identified defines a shift in' paradigm focusing on enhancing and developing local government units capacities particularly in advocating to the local chief executives and local leaders to emulate participatory governance and leadership in support to the different health programs.

B. The ASHI through implementation guidelines of FOURmula ONE for Health (F1) shall establish interventions that will be directed towards achieving end goals in consonance with the health systems goals of better health outcomes; more responsive health system; and more equitable health care financing.

C. The ASHI will also enable the existing institutions to support the present four point agenda of the DOH under the FOURmuIa ONE for Health, as the new framework of health sector reforms, namely: financing (increasing investments for health); service delivery (ensuring Universal access to essential health care); regulation (assuring the quality and affordability of health goods and services); and, governance (enhancing the performance of the health sector).

D. The ARMM Strategy for Health Improvement Operational Framework & Implementing Guidelines shall be adopted by the key stakeholders (ARMM Regional Government, National DOH, and PhilHealth, and other partners e.g. NGOs, donors) as the common guide that defines the respective institution’s contribution to achieve the objectives of improving the health condition among the lives of the people in the region over the medium term. The strategy document was intended primarily to provide the main structural foundations of the region-wide operational processes and main institutional channels for scaling up effort and securing better results in health improvement that everyone can invest in, build on, influence and enhance by their participation.

E. The strategy is essentially governance for improving health outcomes. The focus is making governance functional and responsive at the national (DOH and PhilHealth packages), regional (DOH-ARMM), local (Provincial and Municipal participation in PhilHealth and community-based packages) and community (community-based package) levels, in order to deliver better health outcomes to the poor and disadvantaged families

F. Assistance in the implementation of the ASHI shall have two components namely the technical area support and the field operations support. The technical area support shall lay the groundwork to ensure that necessary inputs and processes are in place. The field operations support shall in turn ensure that these inputs are utilized and processes implemented, directed towards specific health outcomes and impact

G. The regionally appropriate service delivery models must go hand-in-hand with region-specific technical standards and systems. Its implementation must be coupled with a wider base of support in the light of widespread poverty and limited resources for health

The IPHO through the leadership of the Provincial Health Officers shall complement the role of the DOH-ARMM with respect to leadership, logistics, technical and financial (whenever available) assistance, and monitoring and evaluation. Health service delivery and program implementation at the field level falls under the responsibility of the IPHO.

4. In the case of the devolved LGUs in ARMM (Basilan, Marawi City), the implementation of the different health programs rests on the mandate of the Local Chief Executives and local leaders under the Local Government Code in terms of providing management support to the health care delivery system. The DOH-ARMM will continue to provide technical and other logistical support in the delivery of the health programs.

VII. MONITORING & EVALUATION, REPORTING AND FEEDBACK

Monitoring and evaluation of the ARMM Strategy will both be a function of the National and Regional DOH in terms of tracking the progress of meeting the ASHI objectives. While both offices are responsible in the monitoring of the impact indicators however, there are specific operational issues at the DOH-ARMM. One of the major concerns presented by the DOH-ARMM refers to the current flow of reports that are being submitted to the Central DOH Headquarters. The recommended and agreed upon flow of reporting should be from the provinces to the DOH-ARMM and then forwarded to the Central DOH. This will provide DOH-ARMM closer handling and management of reports from the peripherals and would therefore be more responsive to technical program requirements.

VIII. REPEALING CLAUSE

The provisions of the previous orders and other related issuances inconsistent or contrary with the provision of this Order are hereby revised, modified, repealed or rescinded accordingly.
