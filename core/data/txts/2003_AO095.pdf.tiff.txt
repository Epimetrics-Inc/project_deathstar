<subject>SUBJECT: Guidelines for Acute Flaccid Paralysis, Measles and Neonatal Tetanus Disease Surveillance System.</subject>


<body>

The Philippines has been certiﬁed polio-free in October 2000 but surveillance for Acute Flaccid Paralysis (AFP) will continue until the whole world is certiﬁed polio-free as envisioned by year 2005. In addition to AFP, there are two other diseases that have also been targeted for elimination - Neonatal Tetanus (NT) by 2005 and Measles by 2008. The same AFP Surveillance Network, which has been proven to be‘effective, shall be used for Measles and NT surveillance.

As the target years for global polio-free certiﬁcation and Philippine measles and NT elimination are drawing near, further strengthening of the integration of surveillance of these Expanded Program on Immunization (EPI) diseases is very crucial. And as surveillance network for these diseases becomes more sensitive, the numbers of reported cases are expected to increase. Hence, a more efﬁcient case identiﬁcation, prompt and proper specimen collection are top priorities. There is also the need to further clarify the “who,” “where,” “what,” “when,” and “how” questions related to case investigation and specimen collection. In order to address these concerns, these guidelines are prescribed for reference and guidance of ALL reporting hospitals, rural health units and other health facilities.

I. ACUTE FLACCID PARALYSIS SURVEILLANCE

A. Acute Flaccid Paralysis (AFP) case deﬁnition -Sudden onset of ﬂaccid or ﬂoppy muscle weakness/ paralysis in any child less than 15 years old.

A11 AFP cases admitted to the hospital should be investigated using the “AFP Case Investigation Form” (Refer to Annex A).

AFP cases must be investigated and collected with two (2) stool specimens even if the onset of paralysis is more than 14 days but still within two-month period at the time the case was identiﬁed (late consultation).

B. Disease conditions that may manifest with Acute F laccid Paralysis (AFP)

1. Paralytic Polio
2. Transverse Myelltis
3. Traumatic Neuritis
4. Hypokalemia
5. Acute Gastroenteritis with dehydration
6. Hypokalemic Periodic Paralysis
7. Muscle Hypotonia
8. Pott’s Disease
9. TB Meningitis
10. Encephalitis
11. Convulsion
12. CNS Infection (all forms)
13. Guillain-Barre Syndrome

Other diseases not mentioned above may also manifest Acute ﬂaccid paralysis. Therefore, regardless of diagnosis, all AFP cases should be reported, investigated and collected with adeguate stool specimens.

C. Guide on AFP stool specimen collection, storage and transport

Laboratory diagnosis of wild poliovirus is a key strategy in sustaining the country’s polio-free status and in achieving the goal of global polio eradication. Isolation of the wild poliovirus or circulating Vaccine-derived poliovirus (cVDPV) is the diagnostic gold standard. Sustaining a high quality laboratory surveillance is crucial for maintenance of the Philippine “polio-free” status.

Wild poliovirus may be isolated from infected persons within 72 hours after exposure. Viral shedding persists for 3 to 6 weeks or even longer, but is greatest during the ﬁrst two weeks after the onset of paralysis.

Collection and labeling of stool specimen should be done immediately after admission of the patient. Transport should be done after collecting two (2) stool specimens (unless child dies or went home against medical advice before second specimen is collected).

Ensure adequate and timely specimen collection by following these procedures:

1. Immediately collect 2 stool specimens (with 24 - 48 hours interval) from all AFP cases regardless of diagnosis within 14 days from the onset of paralysis.
2. Give laxative if the patient cannot defecate.
3. Stool specimens should be as big as the size of an adult’s thumb. For watery stools, ﬁll up 3A of the specimen container.
4. Place in a dry, clean, sealed and leak proof container. .
5. Label with the name of the patient, date of birth / age, date of collection and specimen number (# 1 or # 2)
6. Store in the refrigerator at a temperature of 4-8°C. Please DO NOT FREEZE the specimen.
7. Fill out completely appropriate laboratory request form (Refer to Annex B)
8. Ship the stool specimens by using provided stool specimen box or improvised vaccine carrier with four ice packs inside to maintain temperature.
9. Send specimens to the Research Institute for Tropical Medicine (RITM) through DHL (free of charge) or to any courier if DHL is not available (freight and handling to be charged to respective Centers for Health Development).

Arrange shipment of specimen in such a way that it will reach RITM on weekdays. Should it reach RITM weekends or holidays, advance notice shall be sent through the fastest mode of communication. (Telephone, FAX, or e-mail). Stool specimen should reach RITM within 7 days after collection and sent to:

Head, Virology Section
Research Institute for Tropical Medicine
Filinvest Compound
Alabang, Muntinlupa City
Telefax: 809-7120
E-mail: ritm@doh.gov.ph

Collecting two specimens 24 hours apart increases the chance of ﬁnding the virus. Specimen collection is easiest done in the hospital. Ideally, the patient remains hospitalized until both stool specimens are collected.

II. MEASLES SURVEILLANCE

A. Measles case deﬁnitions

1. Suspect measles case

History of fever (38°C or more, or hot to touch) and generalized maculopapular (blotchy) rash of 3 or more days’ duration and at least one of the following: cough, coryza and conjunctivitis.

2. Laboratory confirmed measles

- Suspect case that after complete investigation satisﬁes at least one of the following criteria:
a. Measles IgM antibody positive and/or
b. Epidemiologic linkage or direct contact, during the incubation period (7-18 days prior to onset of symptoms) of a suspect case, with an IgM antibody positive measles case.

3. Clinically confirmed measles

- Suspect measles case that, for any reason, is not completely investigated (e. g. death before investigation, no blood sample) or has equivocal IgM antibody test results.

4. Not Measles

— A suspect measles case that is Measles IgM antibody negative, and/or is conﬁrmed positive for other diseases, e. g. rubella or dengue fever is NOT a measles case.

All suspected measles cases admitted to the hospital should be investigated using the “Suspect Measles Case Investigation Form” (Refer to Annex C). Final outcome, diagnosis and laboratory results of all suspected measles cases must be followed up for proper Classiﬁcation.

B. Guide on measles serum specimen collection

Since clinical diagnosis is not sufﬁcient to conﬁrm measles infection, laboratory conﬁrmation is very important in measles elimination campaign. Measles infection may be conﬁrmed by documenting a measles-speciﬁc immune response in the patient and/or by culture and isolation of measles virus from clinical specimen. Blood samples are taken from at least 80% of admitted suspected measles cases in designated sentinel sites (Refer to Annex D). Hospitals should prioritize collecting blood from the ﬁrst 3 - 5 index cases admitted from a given barangay/ municipality.

The most common technique in conﬁrming the measles diagnosis is to test for the presence of measles-speciﬁc IgM antibodies in the sera collected from patients. A single blood specimen obtained shortly after the onset of rash is sufﬁcient for laboratory examination.

Measles-specific IgM antibodies appear within the ﬁrst few days of the rash and decline rapidly after one month. Thus, timeliness of collection is important. Laboratory form should be ﬁlled out properly. Specimen and laboratory forms should be sent to the RITM [as contained in ANNEX C].

1. Blood extraction procedure

a. Make the patient comfortable with the arm accessible to the operator.
b. Label the vacutainer tube with the patient’s name, age/sex, and date of blood extraction.
c. Collect 3cc blood from the patient. Keep blood at room temperature for 2 hours until a clot forms.
d. Allow retracting in the reﬁ'igerator (approximately 4° to 8°C) or in transport box with 4 frozen ice packs. DO NOT FREEZE the specimen.
e. Centrifuge at low speed (SOOXG for 5 minutes) to separate serum from the clot. Separate serum within the following 24 hours.

2. Processing and labeling

a. Decant the serum into a cryovial labeled with the patient's name, age/sex, and date of collection. Avoid mixing red blood cells with the serum as these hemolyze (i.e., the red blood-cells break down) during storage.
b. Store cyrovial at «20°C.
c. Fill out completely appropriate laboratory request form
d. Keep the samples frozen until transport to RITM It should arrive within 48 hours after collection

3. Storage and transport of specimen

a. To ensure that specimens remain cold during transport to the laboratory, frozen ice packs and heavily insulated containers (e.g., vaccine carriers) are needed. They can be reused after thorough washing in water and/or Sodium hypochlorite solution (household bleach or any available disinfectant).
b. Repeated freezing or thawing can have harmful effects on the stability of IgM antibodies.
c. The serum sample should be placed in zip-locked or sealed plastic bag.
d. The case investigation form should be sealed in a separate plastic bag and enclosed within the shipping box.
e. Place the specimens in the transport box with no less "than four pieces of frozen ice packs ﬁtted around the specimens.
f. Send the serum specimen also to the Virology Section of RITM.
g. Shipment of specimens is chargeable against the respective Centers for Health Development.

III. NEONATAL TETANUS SURVEILLANCE

A. NT case deﬁnitions
1. Suspect case

- Any neonatal death between 3 and 28 days for which the cause of death is unknown or

- Any neonate reported as having suffered from NT between 3 and 28 days of age
and not investigated.

2. Conﬁrmed Case

— Any newborn with normal ability to suck and cry during the ﬁrst two days of life and who between 3 and 28 days cannot suck normally, and becomes stiff or has convulsions (i.e. jerking of the muscles or both).

All conﬁrmed or suspected Neonatal Tetanus cases admitted in the hospital should be investigated using the “Neonatal Tetanus Case Investigation Form” (Annex E).

B. Specimen collection for NT

Neonatal tetanus surveillance is purely based on clinical history and ﬁndings. There is no specimen collection involved. Hence, case identiﬁcation and investigation must be precisely based on WHO standard as deﬁned above.

IV. IMPLEMENTING MECHANISM

A. Provision of specimen collection kits.

1. AFP surveillance — The Regional Surveillance and Epidemiology Units (RESUs), will provide free stool specimen collection kits to the hospital EPI Surveillance ofﬁcer/contact person whenever an AFP case is identiﬁed.

2. Measles surveillance - The RESUs will provide free blood specimen collection kits only to the designated sentinel sites [as contained in Annex D]. These are the only hospitals accredited to have the laboratory capacity for measles surveillance because they have a laboratory facility, trained medical technicians and centrifuge unit provided by RITM.

B. Processing of stool and blood specimen at the Research Institute for Tropical Medicine.

The RITM, as the National Reference Laboratory for AFP and Measles surveillance, processes all the stool and blood specimens for free. Therefore, all reporting hospitals and local health units must not charge the patients for the collection and processing of stool and blood specimens for AF P and measles surveillance respectively.

C. Hospital-based EPI surveillance reporting system

<image>figure_1.png</image>

The diagram above is the recommended ﬂow of reporting for EPI disease surveillance. However, different RESUs may develop its own reporting system that is more suitable for its respective regional settings.

Although EPI surveillance is hospital—based, cases seen/reported by RHUs, private clinics and other smaller health units (represented by broken lines) are also included, particularly in AFP surveillance. Close coordination with the national, regional and local EPI staff is encouraged since surveillance data can help the EPI staff in identifying possible areas with low immunization coverage.

D. Roles and functions of hospitals and LGUs in EPI Surveillance

1. Hospitals

a. Admission of AF P, Measles and Neonatal tetanus cases into the hospital.

b. Daily identiﬁcation of AFP, Measles and Neonatal tetanus cases among hospital admissions and OPD consultations as listed in relevant hospital logbooks and records.

c. Weekly counter checking of hospital records for any missed AF P, Measles and Neonatal tetanus cases

d. Clinical examination and initial investigation of AFP, Measles and Neonatal tetanus cases in coordination with RESU/ PESU/ CESU staff or designated regional EPI Surveillance Ofﬁcer.

e. Reporting of identiﬁed cases based on standard case deﬁnitions to Regional EPI Surveillance Ofﬁcer (EPISO) or appropriate provincial/ city health personnel. 

f. Safekeeping of unused specimen collection kit for AF P and Measles surveillance Collection, labeling and storage of stool/ blood specimens while waiting for transport. Done only in designated sentinel site as listed in Annex D.

g. Transport of stool and blood specimen to RITM via DHL or other available freight services. Either the RESU staﬂ or hospital personnel will transport the stool specimen to nearest DHL ofﬁce, depending on what has been agreed 

h. Referral of AFP patients for rehabilitation.

i. Allow the EPISO to have access to medical records of reported AF P, Measles and Neonatal tetanus cases

j. Provide photocopy of medical records of reported AFP cases, particularly those with inadequately collected stool specimen (one or both stools collected after 14 days from onset of paralysis)

k. When the ﬁnal outcome of an AFP, Measles or Neonatal tetanus is not known because the patient went home against medical advice, hospitals should coordinate with the concerned PHO/ CHO or RHU for follow up of cases.

2. Local Government Units/ Rural Health Units

a. Referral of AFP and Neonatal tetanus cases detected at the RHU to nearest hospital reporting site for admission. Measles cases may also be referred to hospital for admission, particularly if there are complications.

b. If the AF P case detected at the RHU is not admitted to the hospital, RHU should facilitate collection of two stool specimens and immediately report the case to the EPI coordinator at the PHO/CHO or the EPISO or any RESU staff for case investigation.

c. If the provincial/ city EPI coordinator or the EPISO cannot respond immediately, a trained DOH representative shall be assigned to investigate the case.

d. Assist the EPISO, local EPI coordinator or DOH representative in determining ﬁnal outcome of reported Measles and Neonatal tetanus cases, especially those who went home against medical advice.

e. Assist the EPISO, local EPI coordinator or DOH representative in conducting 60 days follow-up of all reported AFP cases (Refer to Annex F).

f. Provide EPISO, local EPI coordinator or DOH representative information about immunization history of AFP, Measles and Neonatal tetanus cases and FIC coverage in the areas where cases are clustering.

g. Assist the RESU/ PHO/ CESU in monitoring clustering of cases and during outbreak investigation.

E. Establishment of EPI Surveillance Team in the hospitals

To ensure that the above roles and functions shall be accomplished, each hospital, in collaboration with the respective RESUs, will establish its own EPI surveillance team. The composition of the team and speciﬁc tasks of each member and the RESU/PESU staff will be deﬁned in a Memorandum of Agreement signed by the Chief of Hospital, EPI Surveillance Team Leader, Regional Epidemiologist or RESU Head and the Regional EPI Surveillance Ofﬁcer.

Ideally, the team shall be composed of the hospital’s neurologist, pediatrician, resident physician, pediatric and emergency ward nurses, laboratory staff, Admission Section staff and Records Section staff.

VI. REPEALING CLAUSE

Administrative issuances and other related orders inconsistent with this Order are hereby repealed.

VII. EFFECTIVITY

This order shall take effect immediately.

Draw the vicinity map of the permanent resident of the patient at the bottom of this page. This is important for the 60-day follow-up. Leave the EPI-Id No. blank, this will be ﬁlled up at the FETP.

Reporting: The date of reporting to the RESU should be the date any RESU staff received any information about the AFP case, regardless of method (telephone, formal memo, etc). The reporter should be the person who ﬁrst contacted the RESU staff. Write the full name of the reporter and his/her designation, if necessary. The date of admission should be the ﬁrst day of admission. In case of transfer of hospital or ward and bed number, enter the existing hospital, ward "and bed number where the patient is found during case examination. If there are several physicians attending to the patient, write the most senior.

History & Physical Examination: Onset of paralysis refers to the ﬁrst day when paralysis was noted by any member of the family. If the patient chart does not include any of the items listed, seek additional information from the attending physician/s or the parent/ guardian. Symptoms which occur at the same time as the paralysis such as fever, diarrhea and cough are important in the clinical identiﬁcation of poliomyelitis. Past injections, trauma, bites and others are relevant in the clinical assessment of non-polio AFPs. Flaccid paralysis is “soft or ﬂoppy” paralysis. Meningeal irritation can be elicited by doing the following procedure: with the patient supine and the limbs extended, passively ﬂex the neck, If there is meningeal irritation or stiff neck, the patient will ﬂex his hips. Symmetrical paralysis means both sides of the body are affected, for instance both feet 0 both arms. Deep tendon reﬂexes should be elicited by tapping the patellar, achilles and triceps using a reﬂex hammer. The most common site tested is patellar reﬂex. Percuss with a reﬂex hammer just below the knee cap. Normal response is extension of the leg. Reﬂexes may be graded as: (0) absent (+) diminished (++) normal (+++) exaggerated. Sensation can be elicited by slightly pinching the skin of the affected extremity. In the remarks, write down any clinical information or physical examination ﬁndings not included in the above list which you think is relevant.

Immunization History: If the growth monitoring chart is available and updated, copy the OPV vaccination dates. If the child has no updated growth chart, ask the parent/guardian for the estimated dates of immunizations. OPV4 + are any OPV boosters received during National or Subnational Immunization Days.

Laboratory Information: Write the date the patient passed out the stools. Write the dates when the specimens are actually sent to RITM through DHL. Both stools are best sent at the same time. 

Suspected Cause(s): Write down all the clinical conditions being considered as differential diagnoses for the case. Remember that regardless of the suspected cause, stools should be collected immediately from all AFP cases. Write your ﬁll] name, designation, ofﬁce and telephone/FAX number, if any. Write the date you completed this investigation form. Sign the form. If there are co~investigators, both should print their names and sign the form.

For FETP Use: The FETP staff who receives AF P Form 1 should enter the EPI-Id No. of the AFP,
case.

1 The date repo1t received should be the date the ﬁilly completed form has been received, i.e. any previous telephone or oral report is excluded here. The reporter/s are the signatories to the form as investigators.
2. The laboratory results shall be filled up after RITM results have been received. Two dates are listed for the stools, the date the stool reached RITM and the date RITM laboratory results are received at FETP/MCHS.

Final Diagnosis: The AFP case shall be conﬁrmed to be polio or discarded as non-polio by the expert panel based on the assessment of all the above clinical and laboratory information.

Follow-up: The scheduled date for follow-up can be calculated ﬁom the date of onset of paralysis by adding 60 days. The remarks shall include all notes and information not listed in any part of the form.
