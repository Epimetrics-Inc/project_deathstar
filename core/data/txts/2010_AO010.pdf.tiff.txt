<subject>SUBJECT: Revised Policy on Micronutrient Supplementation to Support Achievement of 2015 MDG Targets To Reduce Underfive and Maternal Deaths and Address Micronutrient Needs of Other Population Groups </subject>


<body>
I. RATIONALE 

Several developments have taken place since the current version of the Micronutrient Supplementation (MS) Guideline was formulated ﬁve years ago. New preparations of micronutrient supplements that could lead to control of the deﬁciencies have been developed and are now available in the country. In 2007, zinc supplementation was introduced as an essential adjunct to oral rehydration therapy (ORT) in the management of diarrhea among children. New scientiﬁc evidence on the efﬁcacy of speciﬁc MS, changes in the nutrient adequacy levels of the population and both national prevalence surveys require that a review and updating of the current policy on targeting and prioritization of MS be undertaken. It is necessary that the target populations for micronutrient supplementation identiﬁed in the past be updated given the new data on the prevalence of micronutrient deﬁciencies. 

MS alongside with diet diversiﬁcation and food fortiﬁcation comprise the three—pronged strategy identiﬁed by the government to combat micronutrient deﬁciency problems in the country. The MS Program is dependent on the progress of diet diversiﬁcation, food fortiﬁcation efforts, and the level of public health signiﬁcance of the prevailing micronutrient deﬁciencies. Diet diversiﬁcation which aims to provide essential micronutrients needed by the body through diet enhancement remains the cornerstone of this strategy. The use of fortiﬁed foods on the other hand remains uneven among the general population. Since both interventions have yet to generate the desired level of micronutrient adequacy among the general population, there is a need to further strengthen the micronutrient supplementation with the aim of contributing to the overall improvement of nutritional status of Filipinos. In that light, the DOH’s current policies and guidelines pertinent to its MS Program need to be updated. 

II. DECLARATION OF POLICY 

This issuance reiterates the provisions of AO No. 2007—0045 Zinc Supplementation and Reformulated Oral Rehydration Salt in the Management of Diarrhea and complements the provisions of DOH AO No. 2008-0029 on the Health Reforms for Rapid Reduction of Maternal and Neonatal Mortality. It also supersedes AO No. 119 s. 2003 on the Updated MS Guide issued in December 2003. 

III. GUIDING PRINCIPLES , The updated MS Policy and Guidelines is governed by the following principles: 

A. ﬂights-Based Approach. MS in the country is anchored on our respect of the rights of children and women as stipulated in our Philippine Constitution, the Convention on the Rights of the Child and the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women. 

B. Systems Approach. Sustained MS provision is contingent on the adoption of a systems approach that institutes fundamental reforms in health service delivery, governance, ﬁnancing and regulations. 

C. Life-Cycle Based Intervention. The MS policy must be aligned with the requirements and conditions of individual clients at various stages of the life-cycle. 

D. Equity Population groups with the least capacity to access MS and those most vulnerable to the deﬁciency must be given top priority in MS assistance. 

E. Complementation of Interventions. MS yields maximum results if complements other parallel but integrated interventions like deworrning, environmental sanitation, healthy lifestyle promotion, immunization and other relevant measures. 

F. Evidence-Based Interventions and Approaches. Policies and guidelines shall be developed based on recent data gathered through prevalence surveys, efﬁcacy studies and other research ﬁndings done locally and globally. Recommendations from international organizations will also be utilized but in consideration of the appropriateness with the local context. 

G. Integrated Service Delivery. Service integration in MS delivery'must be observed in four tracks. First is the alignment of MS with the other existing public health program packages cascading from the national to local level. Second is the conscious and purposive integration of MS at each service delivery point and interface between the health care provider and client both in public and private facilities. Third is the continuity in provision of MS through appropriate referrals and follow-up of clients especially those that require extended period of supplementation over time. Fourth is for MS provision to take place in the health and non—health sector settings, particularly in schools, workplaces, malls, etc. 


IV. OBJECTIVES 

In general, this policy and guide aims to ensure the appropriate provision of quality MS in the country. Speciﬁcally, it aims to: 

(1) Guide health workers and providers in administering micronutrient supplements to identiﬁed population groups and client needs, 

(2) Promote the compliance and adherence among DOH ofﬁces, the LGUS and private sector to the revised policy and guidelines, and 

(3) Generate the support of other stakeholders in implementing the MS policy and guide throughout the country. 


V. SCOPE OF APPLICATION 

This order shall apply to all national, regional and local government ofﬁces, public and private health facilities, NGOs, development partners and other stakeholders whose functions and activities contribute to the delivery and provision of MS nationwide. 

VI. DEFINITION OF TERMS 

1. Diet Diversiﬁcation - It is the changing of dietary practices that affect young children, pregnant and lactating mothers, toward consumption of foods adequate in energy and rich in micronutrients, especially those in short supply in the current diet carried out through nutrition information and education. 

2. Emergency - It is an extraordinary situation wherein people are unable to meet their basic survival needs, due to serious and immediate threats to human life. These usually result from disaster, environmental degradation, among others. 

3. Elderly - These are persons who are more than 60 years old as deﬁned by the Senior Citizen’s Act in the Philippines. 

4.Food Fortiﬁcation - It is one of the interventions to reduce micronutrient deﬁciencies. It is the “process whereby nutrients are added to foods to maintain or improve the quality of the diet of a group, a community or a population. Examples are ﬂour fortiﬁed with Vitamin A and iron, sugar and oil with Vitamin A, rice with iron, and salt with iodine. 

5. Health providers - Refers to individual health staff or any health care facilities (BHS, RHU/health center, private clinics, hospitals, lying-in/birthing clinics, school clinics, corporate clinics, etc.) that provides MS. 

6. Iodine Deﬁciency Disorders - Refers to the ill-effects of iodine deﬁciency in a population that can be prevented by ensuring that the population has adequate intake of iodine. It is the most common cause of preventable mental retardation. It also affects the mother’s reproductive functions and impedes children’s learning ability. 

7. Iron Deﬁciency Anemia - It is a disorder resulting from the decrease in the number of red blood cells due to lack of iron. It is the most common nutritional deﬁciency in the world and occurs if the amount of iron absorbed is too little to meet the body’s needs. 

8. Micronutrient - A dietary element essential only in small quantities. 

9. Micronutrient Supplement - Vitamin and mineral supplements are sources in concentrated forms of those nutrients alone or in combinations, marketed in forms such as capsules, tablets, powders, solutions, etc. that are designed to be taken in measured small—unit quantities but are not in a conventional food form and whose purpose is to supplement the intake of vitamins and/or minerals from the normal diet. 

10. Micronutrient Supplementation - It is a short term intervention intended to correct high levels of micronutrient deﬁciencies by providing large doses of micronutrients immediately until more sustainable food—based approaches (e.g. food fortiﬁcation and diet diversiﬁcation) are put in place and become effective. 

11. Public Health Importance  - Refers to the cut-off points recommended by WHO where a micronutrient deﬁciency is to be considered a public health concern necessitating the state or country to intervene.

12. Vitamin A Deﬁciency - A level of depletion of total body stores .of retinol and its active metabolites such that normal physiologic function is impaired. 

13. Xeropthalmia - A term used to include all signs and symptoms affecting the eye that can be attributed to Vitamin A Deﬁciency.
