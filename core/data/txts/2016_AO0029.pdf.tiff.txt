<subject>SUBJECT: Rules and Regulations Governing the Licensure of Ambulances and Ambulance Service Providers</subject>


<body>
I. BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE 

Section VI. A. 4. of Administrative Order No. 2010—0003 entitled “National Policy on Ambulance Use and Services” states that the “Bureau of Health Facilities and Services shall establish licensing standards for ambulance services and ensures their implementation through regulation. The license of hospital-based ambulance service shall be part of the hospital license. All other ambulance services-shall require a separate license.” 

The current licensing standard requires hospital facilities to provide ambulance services. However, it has been observed that the term ‘ambulance’ has been misused. There are ambulances that operate without competent personnel, appropriate equipment and life—saving drugs capable of responding to medical emergencies. 

Regulation is the ﬁrst step to ensure that health facilities and services comply with the quality standards that will not put patients’ lives at risk. It is in this light that the Health Facilities and Services Regulatory Bureau (HFSRB) sets the basic requirements as well as the minimum structural inputs in relation to ambulance design, physical facilities, manpower, and equipment for the operation of ambulance and ambulance service providers that support the right of patients to safe and quality health care.
