SUBJECT: Guidelines in the Implementation of the Quality Assurance System of Malaria Microscopy in the Philippines 
</subject>
<body>

I. RATIONALE 

Microscopy remains to be the gold standard in malaria diagnosis. The accurate and effective treatment of malaria cases and the elimination of the reservoir of disease transmission largely depend on reliable and accurate diagnosis. The desired reliability, accuracy and efﬁciency of diagnostic facilities and the maintenance of high quality microscopy services at various levels of health care delivery system can be attained by implementing a quality assurance system. 

Support for early diagnosis and prompt treatment of malaria has scaled up in previous years. Diagnostic services are provided by existing microscopy centers based in selected RHUs, hospitals and barangay health centers established in remote malarious areas. These centers are staffed by microscopists who may be medical technologists, laboratory technicians or community volunteer workers specially trained on malaria diagnosis. The performance of this network of providers needs to be enhanced and maintained, vis. a. vis. standards that are set and therefore a Quality Assurance System has to be established and implemented. 

II. OBJECTIVES 

To set the guidelines in the establishment of a quality assurance system for malaria microscopy for local health managers and other service providers toward ensuring and maintaining reliable and efﬁcient diagnostic services for malaria. 

III. SCOPE and COVERAGE 

This Administrative Order shall apply to all health workers at the national, regional, local, public and private health facilities who are responsible for managing, supervising or providing malaria microscopy services and whose functions and activities contribute to the diagnosis and treatment of malaria. 

IV. IMPLEMENTING GUIDELINES A. General Guidelines 1. A 3-level microscopy quality assessment system shall be established. 

a. All health facilities providing malaria microscopy services shall go through validation of their blood films by qualiﬁed provincial/regional validators. The microscopists of these facilities shall undergo the appropriate training provided by the National Core Group of Trainers (NCGT); the proﬁciency skills of the microscopist shall be validated regularly by certiﬁed provincial/regional validators. 

b. All provinces shall have a pool of qualiﬁed and certiﬁed validators maintained through a regular proﬁciency assessment every 2 years. The validators shall be subjected to proﬁciency assessment by the Research Institute for Tropical Medicine—National Reference Laboratory (RITM—NRL) in coordination with the Malaria Program every 2. years.

c. A national core group of trainers/validators certiﬁed by an independent body shall be sustained by the Malaria Program. The training competencies of NCGT members shall be regularly assessed through its Regional Accreditation and External Quality Assurance (EQA) program. 

2. The Centers for Health DevelopmentiProvinci-al Health Ofﬁces/Municipal Health Ofﬁces shall extend ﬁili support to the malaria microscopy quality assessment system. 

3. The head of the health facility providing diagnostic services for malaria shall identify/designate staff to perform malaria microscopy and make the necessary administrative and ﬁnancial arrangements for the designated staﬁ‘ to participate in a Basic Malaria Microscopy Training Course. 

4. The head of the facility and the designated qualiﬁed microsmpist shall cooperatefparticipate in the process of regular assessment of microscopist performance by the validator’s supervisor. The purpose of the validation is to enhance the skills of the microscopist and to help improve the support system for delivering microscopy services such functionality of microscopes, adequacy of laboratory supplieslreagents and recording system. 

5. The medical technologists and microscopists in the different health facilities providing malaria diagnostic services. including private hospitals with trained microscopist shall submit their blood films for validation to the validator in- charge of their area as per schedule depending upon the above-mentioned scheme of validation. The purpose of the validation is to enhance their/VL proﬁciency in accuracy, speciﬁcity, sensitivity and species identiﬁcation and parasite quantiﬁcation. This is in support to the objective of the National Malaria Program to provide prompt diagnosis and accurate treatment of malaria cases, thus accelerating the transition from control to sustained elimination of the disease. 

6. The trained personnel on preventive maintenance of microscopes shall conduct a quarterly regular cleaning/checking for necessary repair or replacement of spare parts of microscopes. The needed repair or replacement of spare parts shall be reported to the regional coordinator who shall immediately act on the matter. Regional malaria coordinators shall appropriate funds for their travelling expenses using the sub-alloted ﬁmds from the Infectious Disease Ofﬁce. 

7. The Regional Malaria Coordinator shall establish networking and include the Medical Technologists in other 60s and NGOs with laboratories performing malaria microscopy to participate in QA. 

8. The Regional Malaria Coordinator shall coordinate with the Infectious Disease Oﬁice/INCDPC through external service for the replenishment of laboratory supplies and reagents. 

B. Speciﬁc Guidelines 

1. Level 1. Training of Microscopist for Malaria Diagnosis 

The medical technologist shall undergo a 2~week Basic Malaria Microscopy Training while non~medical technologist shall undergo 5-week Basic Malaria Microscopy Training. 

a. Those who obtain a passing mark of at least 80% can be designated as microscopist. 

b. Medical technologists with a grade of &lt 80% shall be mentored by the validator for 6 months and take the same 2—week course for the second time. 

c. Non—medical technologist with a grade of &lt 80% shall be replaced by another staff as recommended by the head of the facility to undergo training. 

d. Those with 3. 80% shall be assessed every 3-5 years. They shall undergo a 5—day refresher course with emphasis on species identiﬁcation (all microscopist) and quantiﬁcation (for microscopist assigned in RHU/hospitals/laboratories). 

e. Those who fail the refresher course shall be mentored and supervised; weaknesses and gaps are to be identiﬁed; and a panel of slides is to be sent to them for practice. 

2. Level 2. Quality Assessment of Microscopy Services in Health Facilities 

The performances of malaria microscopists shall be regularly assessed through validation of blood ﬁlms, on—site supervision, feedback and remedial interventions. 

a. Blood Film Validation 

a.1. Random selection of blood ﬁlms adopting a selection scheme.

c.2. The report shall include the key ﬁndings, brief analysis of the results, actions taken and recommendations for further action.

c.3. The consolidated reports shall besubmitted to the CHD, PHO, Provincial Health Team Ofﬁce (PHTO) and Municipal Health Ofﬁce within one month after the validation. 

d. Further Review and Validation by Supervising Validators 

In situations of disagreements on the validation results, a member of the NCG of TrainersNalidators within the region shall conduct ﬁthher assessment/review and make the ﬁnal decision. 

3. Level 3. Proﬁciency Assessment of Provincial, Regional Validators and Certification of the National Core Group of Trainers/Validators 

This level of the QAS requires all regional/provincial/municipal validators to undergo proﬁciency assessments every 2 years by the RITM—NRL and likewise require the accreditation of the NCGT through the WHO Regional Accreditation and EQA Program every 2—3 years. 

3.1 Proﬁciency Assessment for Regional/Provincial/Municipal Validators 

High level of proﬁciency and high quality of microscopy shall be maintained at each level of health facility through monitoring of the performance of microscopists by the validators. It is therefore essential for the validators to likewise undergo regular proﬁciency assessment. A candidate validator for proﬁciency assessment shall be identiﬁed by the PHO of each province. In the absence of a candidate from the province, the PHO shall coordinate with the CHD and request the same to provide a validator for the province. PHO/CHO—candidate validators must pass the Proﬁciency Assessment for Validator conducted by RITM—NRL 

3.1.1. To become a validator, a candidate medical technologist (regional, provincial, municipal health oﬁices/facilities and other private institutions) shall meet the following minimum requirements:
