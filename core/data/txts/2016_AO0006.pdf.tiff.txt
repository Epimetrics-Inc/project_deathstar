<subject>SUBJECT: Revised Guidelines on Surveillance and Response to Adverse Events Following Immunization</subject>

<body>
I. BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE 

In 2010, the Department of Health (DOH) issued Administrative Order (A0) No. 2010- 0017 otherwise known as the “Guidelines in Surveillance and Response to Adverse Events Following Immunization ” as part of its commitment to enhance its AEFI surveillance system and ensure delivery of safe and effective vaccine and iMunization services at all levels. The guideline was made and disseminated to guide the concerned stakeholders on the early detection, reporting, investigation and appropriate response to adverse events following immunization (AEFI). Since then, the Philippines had a' functional AEFI surveillance system. However, inadequate information and delayed investigation was still observed in most of the regions reporting serious AEFI cases. This significantly affected the quality of causality assessment during case review and classification. 

In 2013, the World Health Organization — Western Pacific Regional Office (WPRO) issued a revised Immunization Safety Guidelines Manual which consists of additional information about vaccine safety, common/unusual event for old and new vaccines including its rate per million doses and a new algorithm for AEFI causality assessment. Hence, for further strengthening of the current AEFI surveillance, it is beneficial to adopt it. 

In the same year, a group of consultants from WHO were invited to provide technical expertise and support improvement of the country’s AEFI surveillance system and assist the country in aligning national guidelines with the WHO’S revised immunization safety guidelines. Together with representatives from Epidemiology Bureau and partner offices, an Adverse Event Following Immunization (AEFI) Comprehensive National Assessment was then conducted. 

Anchored on the learning and insights from the said AEFI surveillance strengthening activities in the country and the revised immunization safety surveillance manual, new protocols have been adopted and concomitant changes, to policies and guidelines are imminent for scale-up and full-implementation. This revision of A0 2010-0017 is hereby provided to guide implementers at all levels of health care delivery system. 

 
II. OBJECTIVES 

This AO is issued to provide guidelines for concerned stakeholders on the early detection, reporting, investigation and appropriate response to adverse events following immunization. 

Further, this issuance aims to establish mechanisms for collaboration between and among Epidemiology Bureau, Food and Drug Administration, Family Health Office and other stakeholders involved in AEFI surveillance and response. 

III. SCOPE AND COVERAGE 

This issuance shall apply to health professionals who are providing all vaccines administered under the Expanded Program on Immunization (EPI) and other vaccines given by DOH nationwide. It shall also be applied in all DOH concerned offices and attached agencies, epidemiology and surveillance units, private and government health facilities treating AEFI cases, local government units and the community involved in the surveillance and management of AEFIs. 

Private sectors and/or medical institutions handling immunization services and treating AEFI cases from non—DOH vaccines are mandated to report to the Food and Drug Administration per existing rules and regulations. 

IV. DEFINITION OF TERMS 

a. Adverse Event - Any untoward medical occurrence which follows Following . immunization and which does not necessarily have a causal Immunization (AEFI) relationship with the usage of the vaccine. The adverse event may be any unfavorable or unintended sign, abnormal laboratory finding, symptom or disease. 

b. Causality Assessment - A systematic review of data about an AEFI case to determine the likelihood of a causal association between the event and the vaccine(s) received. 

c. Cluster - Two or more cases of the same or similar event related in time, geography, and/or vaccine administered. 

d. Immunization Safety - The public health practices and policies dealing with the various aspects of the correct administration of vaccines, focusing on minimizing the risk of transmission of disease with vaccination and maximizing the effectiveness of the vaccine. The term encompasses the spectrum of events from proper manufacture to correct administration. 

e. Minor AEFIs ' - These are AEFIs that are not included or categorized as serious AEFIs. These include local adverse events (such as pain, swelling, redness) and systemic reaction (fever) that are expected after immunization as part of the immune response of the vaccine recipient to induce immunity. 

f. Pharmacovigilance - The science and activities relating to the detection, assessment, understanding and prevention of adverse effects or any other possible drug-related problems. 

g. Philippine Integrated - The Philippine Integrated Disease Surveillance and Disease Surveillance Response (PIDSR) in an integrated disease surveillance and Response system established in compliance to 2005 IHR for early detection and response to epidemics. 

h. Safe injection practice - Those public health practices and policies which ensure that the process of injection carries the minimum of risk, regardless of the reason for the injection or the product injected. 

i. Serious AEFI - An event that is causing a potential risk to the health/life of recipient leading to death, life-threatening conditions, congenital abnormalities/birth defects, disability/ incapacity or hospitalization. 

j. Uppsala Monitoring - A WHO collaborating center for international drug/vaccine Center monitoring. 

V. GENERAL GUIDELINES 

1. AEFI Surveillance in the Epidemiology Bureau shall follow the basic principles for surveillance as stipulated in the implementing guidelines of the Philippine Integrated Surveillance and Response (PIDSR) system (A0 2007-0036).
