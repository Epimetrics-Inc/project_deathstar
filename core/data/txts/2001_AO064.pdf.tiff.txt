<subject>SUBJECT: Revised Guidelines For Print Media Placement Through The Department of Health's National Center For Health Promotion</subject>


<body>

I. BACKGROUND/RATIONALE:

Administrative Order No. 87, s. 2000 established the guidelines for centralizing the buying of advertising space on print media or media placements for materials emanating from DOH offices and hospitals from the regional and national levels commencing August 2000.

These include health promotion and creative materials, advertorials (paid articles), regulatory announcements/advisories and notices for public bidding.

The National Center for Health Promotion (NCHP) was also designated as the responsible office to plan, design, implement, and
monitor all DOH messages, campaigns and advertisements for public dissemination. As such, all requests for print media placements need to be coursed through NCHP for review. NCHP was also made responsible for the processing of payment for the media placements.

The implementation of a centralized buying of media placements brought forth some problems i.e. delay in the placement of ads due to delay in approval of materials, procedure on the submission of request and the processing of payments was delayed due to added steps in the approval process.

II. OBJECTIVES/ PURPOSE:

In order to expedite requests for media placements and to give autonomy to hospitals, regional offices and other DOH units,
Administrative Order No. 87, s. 2000 is hereby revised.

III. COVERAGE/SCOPE:

These guidelines shall cover DOH, national and regional hospitals, and other DOH units.

IV. GUIDELINES AND PROCEDURES:

1. All health promotion/creative materials for publication for all the DOH programs and campaigns will be coursed thru NCHP.

2. A Committee on Creatives under the NCHP's Health Communication Division shall serve as the DOH clearing house for messages, design and layout of all DOH-produced health promotion/creative materials.

3. The Media Relations Unit (MRU) under the Office of the Secretary (OSEC) serves as the clearing house for DOH official policy statements.

4. The Office for Management Service (OMS) serves as the clearing house for Invitation for Bidding and Announcement of Job
Vacancies.

5. Publication of all health promotion/creative advertisements shall be with the approval of the DOH Executive Committee, while official policy statements and regulatory announcements/advisories shall be with the approval of the Secretary of Health or his duly authorized representative.

6. Only duly approved health promotion/creative materials will be published by NCHP, which shall also be responsible for the processing of media contract and voucher preparation.

7. Actual buying of media placements relating to regulatory announcements/advisories, notices of public bidding, job vacancies
and the like, the signing of Media Contract and processing of payments, will now be the responsibility of the respective DOH offices, hospitals, regional offices and other units. Payments shall be correspondingly charged to their respective offices/units.

V. IMPLEMENTING MECHANISMS:

A. On Materials Submission

1. Requests for health promotion/creative advertisements will be coursed through NCHP which shall review the content and
design of the draft, recommend changes, draft a comprehensive media plan, and facilitate approval of DOH Management.

2. Submission shall be made through courier delivery, regular mail or fax. The material(s) must be accompanied by a formal request, brief description of the purpose of the advertisement and the intended date(s) of publication addressed to the
Director of NCHP.

3. Publication of duly approved health promotion/creative materials must reach NCHP at least ten (10) working days
prior to the intended date(s) of publication.

B. On Roles of Committee on Creatives (to replace C4) and MRU

1. For health promotion/creative advertisements, the Committee on Creatives shall:

a. review and evaluate draft materials;
b. review and recommend details of media placement (i.e. publication, frequency, cost);
c. present and recommend to the DOH Executive Committee for approval; and
d. provide feedback to concerned office

For official policy statements and regulatory statements/advisories, the MRU shall:
