<subject>SUBJECT: BANNING AND WITHDRAWAL OF OLAQUINDOX AND CARBADOX FROM THE MARKET</subject>

<body>

Olaquindox and Carbadox are anti-microbial drugs used in livestock production to reduce Salmonella shedding in animals. Both drugs have long withdrawal period of about 70 days. The parent compounds of both drugs possess genotoxic potential. Absence of specific toxicity studies on the metabolites and the slight increase in the incidence of adrenal cortex adenomas in male mice have prompted the Joint Expert Committee on Food Additives of the Food and Agriculture Organization of the World Health Organization not to establish an acceptable daily intake for these two active ingredients. Studies also indicate that possible exposure cf workers handling the product to the parent molecules may pose a real risk of irritation, allergy, anaphylactic shock and ether cumulative effects.

The Subcommittee on Veterinary Drugs of the National Drug Committee of the Department at Health therefore conclude that the potential hazards in the use at these drugs outweigh the benefits derived from the use of these products.

Now, therefore, we, the Secretary of Agriculture and the Secretary of Health, jointly and severally order the following:

1. Olaquindox and Carbadox shall no longer be allowed for use in all food producing animals, including in aquaculture regardless of the route of administration.

2. Registration of Olaquindox and Carbadox for use in food producing animals shall be immediately withdrawn and future application for similar registration shall be disapproved.

All existing stocks of both drugs shall be immediately withdrawn from, all distribution outlets. 

4. All concerned personnel are instructed to implement the ban and educate the public on the reason to such ban.


This Order shall take effect fifteen (15) days after publication in a newspaper of general circulation.
