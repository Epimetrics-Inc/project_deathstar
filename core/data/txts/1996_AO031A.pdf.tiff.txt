<subject>SUBJECT: ADDENDUM TO ADMINISTRATIVE ORDER NO. 29 SERIES 1996 ON THE DELEGATION OF PROCUREMENT FUNCTION TO DOH RETAINED HOSPITALS</subject>

<body>

Because of the exigency of the service interest of government and its clientele, authority is likewise given to retained hospitals to extend contracts of present suppliers of contractual services including suppliers of foodstuffs up December 31, 1996 at the same price, terms and conditions. This is only an alternative mechanism to ensure supply of needed commodities and services for health care delivery during this transition period of implementing the modified procurement system. Therefore the hospitals should facilitate conduct of bidding of these services.
