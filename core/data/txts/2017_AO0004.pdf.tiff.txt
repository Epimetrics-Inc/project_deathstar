<subject>SUBJECT: The Philippine Health Agenda 2016—2022 Monitoring and Evaluation System </subject>


<body>
I. Rationale 

The Philippine Health Agenda 2016-2022 (PHA) is a declaration of the government’s commitments and strategies for the health of Filipinos. It shall guide the development of policies, plans, and programs within the Department of Health and its attached agencies, public and private hospitals and health facilities, other national government agencies, local government units, development partners, civil society organizations, academic institutions, medical societies and organizations and all other concerned institutions. 

The strategies under the PHA contribute to the attainment of the Filipinos’ long term vision of a “matatag, maginhawa at panatag na buhay”, as stated by AmBisyon Natin 2040, equitable health outcomes, responsive health systems, and ﬁnancial risk protection. 

A Monitoring and Evaluation System will ensure that the goals of the PHA are being attained by l) establishing a mechanism to track performance; 2) linking inputs, outputs, processes, and outcomes, and 3) strengthening accountability within the DOH. 

II. Objectives 
General Objective: To deﬁne the Philippine Health Agenda Monitoring and Evaluation _ System (PHA M&E). . 

Speciﬁc Objectives:
a) Establish the Monitoring and Evaluation Framework 
b) Deﬁne indicators that will be monitored 
c) Set the schedule for reporting for each indicator 
d) Identify the data source or unit responsible for reporting data for each indicator 

III. Scope of Application
This Order shall apply to all DOH Central Office bureaus and units, DOH Regional Ofﬁces, DOH-retained hospitals (Specialty, Special, Retained, Sanitaria, Treatment and Rehabilitation Centers), DOH-attached agencies, and Local Governrnent Units. Mechanisms to collect data from the private sector shall be established. 

IV. Guiding Principles 

A. Integration. The PHA M&E is part of a harmonized health sector monitoring and. evaluation system operated by the DOH that covers different levels ranging from individual, programmatic, organizational, and sectoral performance. The PHA M&E System shall be implemented simultaneously along with other M&E systems in the DOH. Annex A illustrates how monitoring and evaluation for the Q» Philippine Health Agenda ﬁts into the M&E systems from the programmatic, instittitional, and inter-sectoral levels. Annex B summarizes the routine M&E aetivities of the different DOH units that contribute to PHA M&E 

B. Standardization. The PHA M&E shall be used as the main tool for tracking the implementation of PHA at the sectoral level and reporting to stakeholders. 

C. Accuracy. Reporting of timely and quality data for the PHAM&E Shall be ensured by the responsible ofﬁces. Compliance to reporting shall be part of the performance ratings of the responsible ofﬁces. 

D. Utilization. The PHA M&E, along with other M&E systems inthe DOH, shall prompt the DOH and its concerned ofﬁces to take immediate action to address identiﬁed issues in the implementation of the PHA. 

V. Definition of Terms 

A. Inputs- refer to funds allocated for health ﬁom the national government, local government, development partners, donors, and other stakeholders 

B. Process- refers to activities carried out to achieve the objectives 

C. Outputs- refer to immediate results of the processes conducted 

D. Intermediate Outcomes- effects of the interventions on the population characterized by access, quality, and efﬁciency. 

E. Final Outcomes- long- t—errn effects of the interventiOns 

F. Monitoring— regular and routine collection and analysis of information to track progress of program implementation. It is conducted to ensure that the program is being implemented in accordance to its intent and to make informed decisions for program management

G. Evaluation— an objective and systematic assessment of an ongoing or completed program to determine its effectiveness, impact, and sustainability. 

H. Indicator - quantitative or qualitative variable that provides reliable means to measure a particular phenomenon or attribute 

VI. General Guidelines 

1. The Philippine Health Agenda Monitoring and Evaluation System shall be composed of the following: A. a logical framework to guide how inputs to the health sector are translated into ﬁnal outcomes; B. indicators that measure the progress of attaining the objectives; C. data sources that identify what types of infonnation shall be used in PHA M&E; and D. a reporting mechanism that deﬁnes how the information will be collected. ' 

2.  DOH units shall utilize the PHA M&E System to ensure that DOH programs, projects, and activities are being implemented effectively to achieve PHA goals. 

3. All data required to update PHA indicators shall be submitted by the responsible ofﬁces/units following the speciﬁed reporting ﬂow and reporting frequency for each indicator. 


VII. Speciﬁc Guidelines 

1. The PHA M&E Framework (Annex C) shall deﬁne the relationships of the different components (Inputs, Processes, Outputs, Intermediate Outcomes, Final Outcomes) of the PHA. All items under each component are contributory to the attainment of the succeeding components. 

2. The PHA M&E Indicators (Annex D) shall be utiliZed to monitor PHA implementation for each component of the framework (Inputs, Processes, Outputs, Intermediate Outcomes, and Final Outcomes). The PHA M&E is representative of the health sector, but does not contain all indicators for health. Indicators have been selected based on the following: 1. Priority strategies of the PHA; 2. Sustainable Development Goals; 3. feasibility of data collection; 4. relevance to policy-making. 

3. There shall be ofﬁcial data sources for each indicator in the PHA M&E to ensure consistency and quality of data (Annex D). The. following describes the data sources for monitoring and evaluation in the DOH: 

a) Deaths and birth rates - Civil Registration and Vital Statistics supplemented by surveys or estimates ‘ 

b) Health services coverage (annual monitoring and planning) - Field Health Services Information System (FHSIS), DOH administrative information systems, PhilHealth Database, hospital statistical reports 

c) Health ﬁnancing - Family Income and Expenditure Survey, Philippine National Health Accounts 

d Health outcomes/effects on target population (mid-term and end-term) - population—based national surveys (e. g. National Demographic and Health Survey), impact evaluations 

e) Qualitative data .__ Program Implementation Reviews, operations research, special studies. ' 

4. Data for PHA M&E shall be reported by government and private health facilities and providers. Consolidation, validation, and analysis shall be done at different levels (Municipal, City/Provincial, Regional, and National). Data ﬂow is illustrated in Annex E.
