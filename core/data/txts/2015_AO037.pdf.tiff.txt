I. RATIONALE 

In the implementation of Universal Health Care or Kalusugan; Pangkalahatan (UHC/KP), the health sector through the leadership of the Department of Health (DOH) recognizes the necessity of using information and communication technologies (ICT) for health or eHealth as one of the enabling strategic instruments to support and facilitate the achievement of the national health system goals of better health outcomes, sustained health ﬁnancing, and responsive health system. 

Guided by the Philippine eGovernment Master Plan of linking government data centers and databases to create a secure network for government information systems, and harmonize information technology systems in the public sector through the Medium-Term Information and Communication Technology Harmonization Initiative (MITHI), the Department of Health joined hands with the Philippine Health Insurance Corporation (PhilHealth) and Department of Science and Technology (DOST) in the development and implementation of the Philippine eHealth Strategic Plan (PEHSP) 2014—2020. The Plan highlights the continuous development and implementation of a harmonized National eHealth Program (N eHP), and the continuing ﬁnalization of the key milestones and strategic activities to ensure alignment and interoperability among various eHealth initiatives, programs and/or projects under the NeHP, and in accordance with the MITHI objectives. The collaboration and partnership of the stakeholders are embodied in the issuance of the Joint DOH- DOST Department Memorandum (DM) No. 2013-0200 on the Creation of a Joint National Governance on eHealth (JNGeH), which later became the default MITHI eHealth Committee or Health Cluster, and later reconstituted in April 2015 through Joint DOH-DOST DM No. 2015-0097 and 2015—0098. 

One of the identiﬁed critical eHealth components to implement the projects and activities of the PEHSP is the widespread adoption of health information systems and technologies standards/health data standards (HISS/HITS/HDSS) to improve the accessibility, availability, exchange and use of medical/health information across geographical and health sector boundaries. 

On 10 September 2013, the country adopted and implemented the use of health data standards through the DOH issued Administrative Order (AO) No. 2013-0025 — National Implementation of Health Data Standards for eHealth Standardization and Interoperability (eHSI Release 001), which provided the initial policy and guidelines for the health sector’s national implementation of health data standards for interoperability. Further, said AO sets the initial mandatory health data standards to be adopted or implemented by the entire health sector. The successful implementation of this administrative order is envisioned to promote uniformity and consistency of health data across national collections, establish a set of unique codes to serve as reference for software development, and facilitate data exchange among different application or information systems as well as aggregation of data. 

 

However, the said Administrative Order, as per review of its implementation, lacks in terms of: 1) a robust governance and management structure that will oversee and operationalize the mandatory health data standards; 2) a formal change management and quality assurance protocol for establishment, adoption, implementation, and monitoring of these standards, particularly from the perspective of the end-users at various points of services; and 3) expansion, publication, and feedback mechanism on new sets or updates to the mandatory health data standards to national agencies, stakeholder organizations, and decision makers and implementers at various points of services. 

In response to the above-mentioned governance and management concern, by virtue of Joint DOH-DOST DM No. 2014-0161 — eHealth Philippines National Health Data Committee, Creation of National Experts Groups on Health Data'Standards and Privacy, the reconstituted National Health Data Committee is now assumed by the National eHealth Steering Committee as a way of deﬁning the overall governance structure on eHealth, including streamlining of protocols concerning matters on health data standards. Further, given the inter-agency nature of the implementing mechanisms on health data standards, the National Health Data Standards Experts Group is created to assist the National eHealth Steering Committee in the development of relevant policies and implementing mechanisms on the adoption and implementation of national health data standards. 

Thus, in order to address the absence of an ofﬁcial national framework for adoption and management of mandatory and common standards for the health sector, the National Health Data Standards Experts Group arrived at an agreement to create and formalize a standard change management protocol for recommending, adopting, implementing, and monitoring health data standards for use in all electronic health transactions to achieve information interoperability at all governance and management levels of health data and information. The agreement was forged through the creation of the National eHealth Information Interoperability Standards Change Management Protocol. Further, this Joint Administrative Order deems towards the expansion and constant updates to the mandatory health data standards for adeption and implementation by the entire health sector, as well as their consequent publication to national agencies, stakeholder organizations, and various points of services. 

II. DECLARATION OF POLICIES 

1. Strengthening health systems and improving efﬁciency and effectiveness in health service delivery need both operational and summary data. The operational data documents routine activities at the health provider level, whereas the summary data is used to manage national health resources, develop policies, assess performance, and determine major investments, technical assistance and programs needed to achieve national health goals. Thus, information need to be made available when needed. 

2. As one nation, all health facilities need to comply with the national implementation of health data standards for interoperability to gain a true picture of the Philippine Health System, e. g. health status of the Filipino people, health issues, concerns and/or problems that can be addressed by the health sector, and others. 

3. The Health Enterprise Architecture provides a holistic view of the country’s health processes/systems, information, information technology assets, and interoperability standards. It serves the guide in the development of health information systems to meet the country’s requirements and support improvements in the health systems; helps describe the state of the health information system in the country; as well as provide the roadmap for continuing growth. 

4. Information and communication technologies (ICTs) can provide the means to merge different systems and facilitate sharing of data/information. Various health facilities have already adopted the use of ICTs in their operations. With the use of technologies and standards for interoperability, the national health data reporting system to the Department of Health allows data aggregation from various data sources or different health facilities’ information systems. Health facilities, according to their capacities, may implement their own systems as long as these comply with the national health data reporting standards.
