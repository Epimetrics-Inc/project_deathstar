<body>

I. BACKGROUND:

Women who were forcibly rounded up, detained and tinned into sex slaves by the Japanese Imperial Army during the World War II have come to be popularly known as comfort women. The ordeal these comfort women went through has undoubtedly left physical, mental, psychological, emotional scars. On top of these, they already have disabilities and facing other geriatric / gerontological problems since they are already in their 60’s and above. 

Considering these concerns, the Department of Social Welfare and Development has initiated the “Assistance to Lolas in Crisis Situation Project.” New on its second year of implementation, it aims to extend assistance to “Lolas” in response to their psycho-social and other welfare needs through provision of appropriate goods and services.
