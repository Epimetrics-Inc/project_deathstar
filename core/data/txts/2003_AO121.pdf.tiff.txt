<subject>SUBJECT: STRENGTHENING IMPLEMENTATION OF THE NATIONAL NEWBORN SCREENING SYSTEM</subject>

<body>

I. RATIONALE:

Newborn screening was introduced more than 40 years ago in the United States. It is, now considered a standard of routine newborn care among developed countries. Newborn screening enables early detection and management of certain metabolic disorders, which if left untreated may lead to mental retardation and death. The early diagnosis and treatment of these disorders assures the child’s right to live and safeguards him/her to reach his/her full potential.

In the Philippines, newborn screening was initiated in 1996 by the Newborn Screening Study Group consisting of pediatricians and obstetricians from 24 hospitals accredited by the Philippine Pediatric Society, Inc (PPS) and the Philippines Obstetrics and Gynecological Society, Inc (POGS).

Pilot studies on 272,547 newborns (NIH, June 2003) have shown the following incidences of disorders:

From these statistics, it is predicted that newborn screening for these disorders can save at least 33,000 newborns from mental retardation and death if all 1.5 million newborns born annually are screened. Cost beneﬁt analysis has demonstrated that a national newborn screening program vs a do-nothing alternative yield benefits of P600 million pesos annually (NIH, July 2003).

In line with the Vision of the Child 21 Framework that by the year 2025 it is crucial that newborn screening be integrated in the current health care delivery system. DOH recognizes that newborn screening will contribute in the objective of ensuring that all Filipino children have access to, and avail themselves of total quality care for their optimal growth and development to their full potential.

The Department has made efforts in implementing newborn screening in a limited scale. On January 2001, the Department of Health (DOH) issued Administrative Order No. l-A known as “Policies on the Nationwide Implementation of Newborn Screening”. This Order envisioned that by the year 2004, newborn screening shall be a part of standard newborn care and a formal national program would be in place. Since then, newborn screening has been pilot-tested and implemented in more than 250 hospitals and communities all over the country through the collaboration of DOH and the National Institutes of Health (NIH).

Considering that newborn screening is now an internationally accepted and was declared as medically necessary, full nationwide implementation is the next challenge for the program. With the end-view of strengthening the newborn screening program and making this more accessible among the general population, this Administrative Order aims provides the general guidelines for the national implementation of the NBS. This order also prescribes procedures for integrating newborn screening into various health efforts and activities at the national and local levels, including emphasis on community newborn screening implementation.

II. COVERAGE AND SCOPE

This Administrative Order shall apply to all government and private hospitals, clinics, and other health facilities.

III. GOALS AND OBJECTIVES

A. GOAL

All Filipino newborns are screened for the more common and life-threatening heritable disorders.

B. OBJECTIVES

The objectives of the National Newborn Screening System are:

1. To ensure that every newborn has access to newborn screening for certain heritable conditions that can result in mental retardation, serious health complications, or death if left undetected and untreated;

2. To establish and integrate a sustainable newborn screening system within the public health and hospital delivery system;
