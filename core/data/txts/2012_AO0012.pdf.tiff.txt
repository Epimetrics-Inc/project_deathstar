SUBJECT: Rules and Regulations Governing the New Classiﬁcation of Hospitals and Other Health Facilities in the Philippines
</subject>

<body> 

1. RATIONALE/ BACKGROUND

Pursuant to Section 16 of Republic Act No. 4226' otherwise known as Hospital Licensure Act, “The licensing agency shall study and adopt a system of classifying hospitals in the Philippines as to: (1) general or special; (2) service capabilities; (3) size or bed capacity and (4) classiﬁcation of hospital whether training or not”. Regulation of health facilities takes into account their service capacities and compliance with standards for manpower, equipment, construction and physical facilities. It is of the essence that the actual situation be taken into consideration in dealing with the current classiﬁcation of hospitals and other health facilities.

A research project was therefore undertaken by the Department of Health (DOH) through the Bureau of Health Facilities and Services (BHFS) to map out the services and equipment available in all hospitals and to get an overview of the typology of the existing hospital classiﬁcation and other hospital-based facilities. Knowledge of the distribution of services and equipment would enable DOH in improving access to the much needed services in keeping with the goal of Kalusugang Pangkalahatan/ Universal Health Care. In addition, this would guide the health agency in future policy direction. Consequently, in support of the study, on April 25, 2011 DOH issued Department Memorandum No. 2011-0135 entitled “A Survey of the Services and Equipment Available in Hospitals Nationwide”. Partial survey results indicate variations in the service characteristics of hospitals not only among the different categories but also within the same category based on the facilities and services they provide.

Further, the latest category of Level 1 hospitals is not consistent with Section 8 of RA. 4226 on “Minimum Standards and Construction of a Hospital” which states in part that “In order that a permit to construct a hospital can be issued, the hospital plan shall provide sufﬁcient bed space for the hospital bed capacity proposed, a laboratory room, operating room including work rooms for sterilization, anesthesia preparation, X-ray room, pharmacy, dispensary or out-patient department, delivery room, isolation room, autopsy room or morgue... . Under the ongoing classiﬁcation, provision of surgical and ancillary services is not requiredin Level 1 facilities.

Thus, a new classiﬁcation of hospitals and other health facilities becomes inevitable in compliance with statutory requirements and the emergence of new health facilities. The move aims to upgrade the services offered in health facilities and come up with a more homogeneous category for health facilities with similar services. The new classiﬁcation ofhealth facilities will simplify licensing systems and processes and make the regulatory scheme more effective and efﬁcient.

Related issuances such as, but not limited to, the following, may no longer be relevant and realistic especially on the aspects of manpower and equipment, to wit, Administrative Order (A.O.) No. 70-A s. 2002 entitled “Revised Rules and Regulations Governing the Registration, Licensure and Operation of Hospitals and Other Health Facilities in the ' Philippines”, A.O. No. 147 s. 2004 and A0. No. 2005 — 0029, which are Amendments to A0. No. 70—A s. 2002. Thus, this Order rescinds the foregoing issuances in line with the objective of health regulatory reforms to ensure access to safe, quality and affordable health facilities and services.
