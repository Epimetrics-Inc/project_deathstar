<subject>SUBJECT: Revised Policies and Guidelines for the Institutionalization and Decentralization of the Department of Health Drug Consignment System</subject>


<body>

I. RATIONALE

In order to enhance the physical and ﬁnancial accessibility of essential drugs and medicines (EDM) commonly dispensed to the public as a commitment of our Government in the State of the Nation Address (SONA), the Department of Health (DOH) has explored innovative ways to achieve that commitment.

Among the courses of action that was projected to be a viable alternative in bringing into realization such commitment is the procurement of drugs through consignment method.

This strategy was achieved under Administrative Order No. 5 s. 2003, also known as Guidelines and Procedure for the insﬁtuﬁona/ization of the Department of Health Drug Consignment System.

Under the said A.O., DOH Hospitals were allowed to enter into a Drug Consignment Agreement with legitimate manufacturers/suppliers which have the capability to meet the demands of the Hospital for essential drugs and medicine in a sustainable manner.

The advantages of the said System are:

1) It will enhance the availability of low-cost, high quality drugs and medicines in DOH hospital pharmacies, without entailing additional cost or investment on the part of the government;

2) The income that hospitals will earn from the direct sales of these drug products may be used for the improvement of hospital operations, thereby improving healthcare services;

3) Funds allotted for the procurement of supplies and medicines will be freed up and may be utilized for other equally important needs of the hospitals;

4) Even with mark-up by the hospitals, the prices of these consigned medicines will still be lower compared to private outlets. This situation may provide healthy competition with nearby private retailers and may therefore prompt them to lower drug prices as well;

5) No budgetary allotment and notiﬁcation of cash allocation are required in these transactions since payment will be based on actual drug sales of the respective hospital pharmacies, decreasing red tape in the use thereof;

6) Optimum waste and inventory management as a result of the mechanism to return unused medicines within the agreed period or as a consequence of the available shelf-life.

However, after reviewing the current system for consignment, it was observed that imperfections in the market have consequent effects on the roles and processes at each level of the organizational structure. It was observed that factors like: a) existence of local or satellite branch of pharmaceutical suppliers; b) willingness of the pharmaceutical suppliers to enter into a consignment agreement; c) peculiar drug needs of individual DOH Hospital; and cl) delivery time, have great impact on the availability and prices of drugs.

Further, the consignment system of the DOH was limited only to DOH Hospitals. There is a strong clamor to apply the same system under similar activities regulated and initiated by the Centers for Health Development (CHDs), such as but not limited to Botika ng Barangays.

Cognizant of the said areas for consideration and the existing technical and administrative capability and expertise of the DOH Hospitals and the CHDs, there is a need to revise A. O. No. 5, s. 2003, by decentralizing and devolving certain functions performed at the DOH Central Ofﬁce level, and thereby empowering the abovementioned entities.

II. PURPOSE AND OBJECTIVES

The purpose of this Order is to establish guidelines and procedures to ensure the availability and relative'affordability of essential drugs and medicines (EDM) through a consignment system administered by DOH Hospitals, CHDs, and other health units that may be explicitly authorized by the DOH as the need arises.

The objectives of this Order are as follows:

1. To provide time-bound systems and procedures that would establish the DOH Drug Consignment System (DOHDCS);

2. To define the attendant roles and responsibilities Of prospective Consignor and Consignee; and

3. To provide safeguards that would ensure that the system is within the framework of existing rules and regulations on procurement used by the Government in general and by the DOH in particular.

III. SCOPE AND COVERAGE

This Order shall be applicable to all DOH Hospitals, CHDs, and Other health units nationwide that may be explicitly authorized by the DOH as the need arises.

3.

4. Accreditation Certiﬁcate/Requirement — a certiﬁcate issued by the DOH Accreditation Committee which grants authority to a supplier company to competitively participate in a public bidding.

5. Consigned Drugs and Medicines — are drugs and medicines which the Consignor delivers to the Consignee under a consignment agreement.

6.
