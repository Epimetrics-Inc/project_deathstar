<subject>SUBJECT: GUIDELINES IN SURVEILLANCE AND RESPONSE TO ADVERSE EVENTS FOLLOWING IMMUNIZATION (AEFI)</subject>


<body>
I. BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE 

The goal of immunization is to protect the individual and the public from vaccine- preventable diseases. Although modern vaccines are safe, no vaccine is entirely without risk. Some people experience events after immunization ranging from mild side effects to rare life- threatening, illnesses. In some cases, these reactions are caused by the vaccine; in others, they are caused by an error in the administration of the vaccine; and in the majority of cases, there is no relationship. 

While most adverse events following immunization (AEFI) are mild and have no long-term consequences, serious adverse reaction can occur albeit, very rarely. Ultimately, any question from the public about the safety of vaccination is a cause for concern. They must be swiftly and effectively investigated and acted upon. Rumors and misinformation about vaccines and immunization sometimes occur because perceived or true adverse events following immunization are handled inappropriately. Incorrect information during media coverage on vaccine safety issues can further propagate and sensationalize misinformation. As a result, rumors about vaccines may spread, and lead to reduced immunization coverage and increased childhood illnesses and unnecessary deaths. 

It is in this context that surveillance and management of AEFIs should be strengthened at all levels of the health system. Currently, AEFI is one of the immediately notiﬁable diseases/syndromes or events under the Philippine Integrated Disease Surveillance and Response (PIDSR) system of the Department of Health. However, the system provides only the reporting mechanisms of AEFIs with no provisions for the investigation and management of AEFIs. In October 2007, the DOH issued an Administrative Order (A.O. No. 2007—0028) for the implementation of “Bakuna ang Una sa Sangol at Ina” that provides guidelines on reporting, treatment of AEFIs and legal assistance for health workers. The AD. however, did not cover provisions on risk communications, organizational framework, causality assessment, laboratory investigation and other important aspects of surveillance and management of AEFIS. 

It is in light of the above that a comprehensive and integrated set of guidelines for surveillance and response to AEFIS is hereby issued. 


II. DECLARATION OF POLICIES 

Surveillance and management of AEFIS shall be guided by the following legal mandates and policies: 

Administrative Order No. 2007-0036, Guidelines on the Philippine Integrated Disease Surveillance and Response (PIDSR) Framework, Implementing Guidelines, Section A, includes AEFIS as one of the immediately notiﬁable diseases/syndromes or event under the Philippine Integrated Disease Surveillance and Response (PIDSR) system. 

Administrative Order No. 2007—0028, Implementing Guidelines of the Executive Order No. 663: “Implementing the National Commitment for Bakuna ang Una sa Sangol at Ina”, attaining World Health Organization ’s goal to eliminate measles and Neonatal Tetanus, eradicate polio, control hepatitis B and other vaccine preventable diseases for the “Knock—out Tigdas”, General Guidelines, provides mechanisms for reporting, treatment of AEFIs and legal assistance for health workers. ' 

Administrative Order 0023 series of 2008 — National Policy on Patient Safety - which calls for the prevention of harm to patients thru the prevention, avoidance and amelioration of risk, adverse outcomes or injuries stemming from the process of health care. 

III. SCOPE AND COVERAGE 

This issuance shall apply to health professionals from the public and private sectors who are providing vaccination nationwide, the Department of Health (DOH) concerned ofﬁces and attached agencies, epidemiology and surveillance units, private and government health facilities, local government units and the community involved in the surveillance and management of AEFIs. It shall cover all vaccines administered under the Expanded Program on Immunization (EPI) program and other vaccines given by DOH. 

IV. OBJECTIVES 

This Order aims to guide the concerned stakeholders on the early detection and appropriate and quick response to adverse events following immunization. 

V. DEFINITION OF TERMS 

1. Adverse event - A medical incident that takes place after an immunization, following causes concern, and is believed to be caused by immunization (AEFI) immunization. 

2. AEFI Table - A list of AEFIs or conditions and the time frames in which they must occur after vaccine administration. It is used as a tool for “presumption of causation“ for all vaccines. 

3. Causation-in—fact - Standard of proof which relies on a factual determination that a vaccine actually caused an injury or death. 

4. Cluster - Two or more cases of the same or similar event related in time, geography, and/or vaccine administered. 

5. Coincidental adverse event - A medical event that would have occurred whether or not the individual had received an immunization prior to the event. 

6. Disease Reporting Unit (DRU) - Refers to any health facility where cases of notiﬁable diseases are identiﬁed and reported (e. g. hospitals, clinics, municipal health ofﬁces, city health ofﬁces, barangay health stations, community, and quarantine stations). 

7. Disease Surveillance Coordinator (DSC) - Refers to staff of government and non—government health facilities (e.g. hospitals, clinics, RHUs) who have received training on PIDSR with an ofﬁcial designation as disease surveillance coordinator by the head of the facility 

8. Immunization Safety - The public health practices and policies dealing with the various aspects of the correct administration of vaccines, focusing on minimizing the risk of transmission of disease with the injection and maximizing the effectiveness of the vaccine. The term encompasses the spectrum of events from proper manufacture to correct administration. 

9. Immunization safety surveillance - A system for ensuring immunization safety through detecting, reporting, investigating, and responding to AEFIs. 
 
10. Injection Reaction - Event from anxiety about vaccination, or pain from the injection itself rather than the vaccine. 

11. Minor AEFIs - These are AEFIs that are not included or categorized as serious AEFIs. 

12. Pharmacovigilance - The science and activities relating to the detection, assessment, understanding and prevention of adverse events and other possible drug-related problems. 

13. Program—related AEFI or program error - A medical incident that was caused by some error in the transportation, storage, handling, or administration of vaccine. 

14. Safe injection practice - Those public health practices and policies which ensure that the process of injection carries the minimum of risk, regardless of the reason for the injection or the product injected. 

15. Serious AEFIS - These are AEFIs that are life threatening and those that result in hospitalization (or prolonged hospitalization), disability (or have the potential to result in disability) or death. 

16. Vaccine reaction - An event caused or precipitated by the active component or one of the other components of the vaccine. This is due to the inherent properties of the vaccine. 


VI. GUIDING PRINCIPLES 

1. Vaccines used in national immunization programs are safe and effective. However, adverse events can occur following immunization. In addition to the vaccines themselves, the process of Immunization is a potential source of adverse events. 
2. Surveillance of AEFIs is an effective means of monitoring immunization safety and contributes to the credibility of the immunization program. It shall allow proper management of AEFIs and avoid inappropriate responses to reports of AEFIS that can create a sense of crisis in the absence of such surveillance. 
3. AEFI surveillance shall follow the basic principles for surveillance as stipulated in the implementing guidelines of the Philippine Integrated Surveillance and Response _ (PIDSR) system. See AO 2007-0036 
4. AEFI reporting shall be encouraged at all levels. The aim is for early detection of AEFI so that appropriate measures can be instituted. 
5. Rapid response to public concern about vaccines, as well as immediate and clear communication of explanations and actions, will preserve the integrity of the . immunization program.
