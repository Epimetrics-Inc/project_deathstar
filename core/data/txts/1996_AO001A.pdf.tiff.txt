<subject>SUBJECT: GUIDELINES ON ROUTINE IMMUNIZATION OF INFANTS DURING KNOCK OUT POLIO DAYS</subject>

<body>

Every 3rd Wednesday of April and May from 1996-2000 are designated as KNOCK OUT POLIO DAYS targetted at eradicating the polio virus from the Philippines. On these days, only Oral Polio Vaccine will be given to all children between 0-59 months old. This is in contrast to the previous OPLAN ALIS DISEASE National Immunization Days.

The following guidelines are hereby promulgated to clarify the relation between routine EPI and the Knock Out Polio Days:

1. Schedule the routine immunization of children aged 1 month 6, 10 and 14 weeks and 9 months (BCG, DPT, OPV, hepatitis B or measles vaccines) on the week before the Knock Out Polio Days. On this scheduled day, give them all their scheduled routine vaccine doses, that is, including their OPV 1,2 or 3.

2. Ask the infants to be brought again the following week for their Knock Out Polio OPV dose.

Remember - Knock Out Polio doses are extra doses, that is, they are to be given in addition to the routine OPV doses. They are not to be considered as the equivalent of the routine OPV doses. The interval between doses does not matter at all.

3. If an infant comes during the Knock Out Polio Day and the parent requests for other routine vaccines to be given as scheduled, you have two options:

3.1. If you have the other antigens ready in the center, give these as requested.
3.2. If you do not have the other antigens at hand, ask the parent to bring the child the following scheduled immunization for the other antigens.

4. If an infant previously unreached by routine immunization comes during the Knock Out Polio Day, hand out an information leaflet on routine vaccination schedule for infants and give clear instructions on when and where to come for the other vaccines.

5. In hard-to-reach areas, the decision to include other antigens during visits to these areas will depend on the assessment of the vaccination team. The points to be considered in the decision should include the availability of the other antigens and the other supplies needed, such as needles and syringes; and the possibility of returning to the same area within the coming month or quarter.

If the vaccination team can return to the area within the same month or quarter, then it will really be easier for them to carry only OPV during the Knock Out Polio Day and return to the area for the routine vaccinations.

For immediate compliance.
