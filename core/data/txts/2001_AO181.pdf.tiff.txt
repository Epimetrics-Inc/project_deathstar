<subject>SUBJECT: Corporate Re-Structuring Project for Selected DOH Hospitals in support of the Health Sector Reform Agenda</subject>

<body>
I. RATIONALE:

In line with the goal of the Health Sector Reform Agenda (HSRA) of providing equitable quality health services, reforms for government hospitals are being initiated to complement other reform strategies in the areas of local health system, public health, health financing and regulation. The major objectives of the Hospital RefOrm component include among others, the following:

> to promote efficiency in hospital operations and management;
> to enhance the capabilities thru facilities and human resource upgrading; and
> to attain fiscal autonomy and managerial flexibility while maintaining the government's social responsibility for the indigent patients.

It is within this framework that re-structuring of DOH Hospitals into government owned and controlled corporations (GOCC) is being pursued. Corporate re-structuring has been identified as the most effective means to attain the objectives of hospital reform.

On the basis of the assessment of the Hospital Corporate Reâ€”structuring Project Team and inputs during the December 16, 2000 Policy Forum/National Staff Meeting, selected DOH Hospitals shall be included in the initial project phase given the project timeline.

This Order sets out the principles and specific guidelines that shall guide decision-makers and planners on corporate re-structuring.

II. BASIC PRINCIPLES

1. Corporate re-structuring is a component of HSRA and shall complement other reform strategies.

2. Corporate re-structuring shall be adopted as the key strategy to allow government hospitals greater fiscal autonomy while retaining its mandate to serve the poor and ensure quality service.

3. Hospitals for restructuring shall be identified and determined through an assessment, which shall be undertaken by a team of experts.

4. Assessment indicators shall focus on hospital performance finances and operations to include the quality of services given, status of equipment and facilities, infrastructure and capability of staff. Assessment shall also consider the hospital's understanding and willingness to undertake organizational change.

5. Advocacy and capability building activities shall be made necessary requirements towards attaining state of readiness for corporate restructuring.

III. CORPORATE RE-STRUCTURING OPTIONS

Three restructuring options shall be considered:

A. Option A - Use of the Corporate Powers of a Chartered COCC pending the passage of a legislation

While a legislative process of converting DOH hospitals into Government Owned and controlled Corporation (GOCC) is being pursued, hospitals shall be restructured using the corporate poWers of existing government hospital corporations or chartered hospitals to acquire retained hospital(s) through a lease contract agreement. This shall serve as a transition phase while a legislative process is being pursued converting the retained hospitals into to a GOCC. Under this set-up, the DOH transfers the operation as well as assets of retained hospitals to existing hospital corporations. A retained hospital shall then become a local unit of the said Hospital Corporation. If in case, the assets of the local unit cannot be immediately transferred and ceded to the chartered hospital, the DOH, for a minimal fee not disadvantageous to the Government, leases the aforesaid assets under Section 47 of Executive Order 292, Instituting the Administrative Code of 1987.

An Executive Committee shall be formed which shall be responsible for the Operations of the hospital and be accountable to the Board of the Hospital Corporation. The operation of the local unit through the Creation of the Executive Committee can be implemented in accordance with the corporate powers granted to the Hospital Corporation by law. In this instance, the Board can issue a resolution to the said effect.

B. Option B - Registration of Hospitals with Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) as a Non-stock, Non-profit Government Owned and Controlled Corporate Hospital or a Foundation

Operation of DOH hospitals can be considered proprietary in nature. As such, through the issuance of an Executive Order,  the President of the Philippines can authorize the Secretary of Health to institute the necessary changes to convert the present structure of a government hospital from a DOH line agency to a non-stock, non-profit, wholly owned and controlled government corporation, also termed as a "Foundation". It shall be managed by a "Board of Trustees." The DOH shall create this. board whose members shall serve as incorporators, and which shall be accountable to the Government. Once the corporation is established or created, the assets of the newly re-structured hospital shall be transferred to the corporation under a Deed of Transfer as provided for under the Executive Order. In this form, the hospital can continue receiving grants and government subsidies at the same time giving it latitude to retain income generated from its operation.

C. Option C - Re-structuring as mandated through the Local Government Code

This option shall apply the Local Government Code as a legal basis to restructure hospitals. Hospitals may be re-structured into corporate entities through a Sangguniang Panlalawigan Resolution. This is in accordance with Article 24 of the Rules and Regulations Implementing the Local Government Code which provides that "consistent with the local autonomy and decentralization, the provision of the delivery of basic services and facilities shall be devolved from the National Government to provinces, cities, municipalities and barangays so that each LGU shall be responsible for a minimum set of services and facilities in accordance With the established national policies, guidelines and standards."

This process involves the passage of Sangguniang resolution by the LGU concerned. In line with its corporate powers provided under Section 15 of the Local Government Code and Article 46 of the Rules and Regulations Implementing the Local Government Code, the Sanggunian can enact an ordinance or pass a resolution providing for the creation and registration of the corporation wholly owned by the LGU. If in case the assets of the hospital cannot be immediately transferred or ceded to the LGU, the government can for a minimal fee lease the hoSpital asSets to the LGU under section 47 of Executive Order 292, Instituting the Administrative Code of 1987.
