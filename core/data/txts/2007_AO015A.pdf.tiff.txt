3. Corrections on page 13, under the Heading of Surgical Approach, To Read as ffs:

“Around 70% of patients with liver cirrhosis who had an initial variceal hemorrhage will re—bleed. The risk of re—bleeding is lower in patients with pre-sinusoidal obstruction (e.g. portal vein thrombosis or schistosomiasis) and patients with compensated cirrhosis (Child’s A) as compared to patients with decompensated cirrhosis (Child’s B & C). Furthermore, it strongly depends on the portal pressure and variceal pressure. Mortality of re-bleeding mainly depends on liver function, and it varies between 15 to 50%. Concomitant infection is as an important risk factor of failure to control bleeding & re—bleeding and therefore, worsens prognosis.”
(All numbers in parenthesis are to be deleted)

All other provisions of said Administrative Order remain in Effect.
