<subject>Subject: Guidelines on the Development of Investment Proposals for the Health Sector</subject>

<body>
I. RATIONALE

The Constitution mandates the State through the Department of Health (DOH) to protect and promote the right to health of the people and instill health consciousness among them. By virtue of Executive Number 102, the DOH serves as the national technical authority on health to ensure the highest achievable standards of quality health care, health promotion and health protection, from which local government units, non-government organizations, other private organizations and individual members of civil society will anchor their health programs and strategies. Recognizing this important role of the Department, the Investment Coordinating Committee which is responsible for providing policy guidelines for programming and approval of specific programs and projects for Official development Assistance (ODA), requires that all health and health-related investment proposals be officially endorsed by the DOH.

Under the re-engineered DOH, the functions of each bureau and office in the Central Office were defined to ensure that programs, activities and projects are appropriate to the new role of the Department. The functions of each bureau however are interrelated such that policies, systems and guidelines must be in place in order to have synergy in conducting critical activities. One important activity is project development. In order to ensure that all investment proposals on health are in consonance and responsive to health goals and national thrusts and priorities; and, to guarantee efficient and effective management of such proposals, the following policies and guidelines are hereby established.

II. SCOPE

This Administrative Order shall apply to all investments and other project development initiatives emanating from Central Office bureaus and services, Centers for Health Development (CHDs), DOH hospitals and attached agencies, Other Government Organizations (OGOs), Local Government Units (LGUs), Non-Government Organizations (NGOs) and the private sector.

III. DEFINITION OF TERMS

Concept - preliminary project proposal which demonstrates relevance to national goals and objectives, and which merits further development and detailed design for inclusion in the MTPIP.

Proposal - project concept that is more detailed and developed according to specific donor requirement; and which merits endorsement to DOH Executive Committee.

Proponent - agency or office or individual where the project concept or proposal originated

Internal Proponent- DOH offices, bureaus, CHDs, DOH hospitals and attached agencies
