<subject>SUBJECT: Inclusion of Progestin Subdermal Implant as one of the Modern Methods Recognized by the National Familty Planning Program</subject>
<body>
 
I. RATIONALE 

The Philippines continues to have a high level of maternal mortality and has low likelihood of meeting its Millennium Development Goals of reducing maternal deaths by three quarters and in providing universal access to reproductive health services (5th MDG Progress Report, 2014). Despite the increasing number of facility based births, the number of maternal deaths has remained essentially the same in the past 50 years (Philippine Civil Registry and Vital Statistics 1960-2010). The high level of maternal mortality could be driven by high unmet need for modern family planning services. It is estimated that 5.7 million Filipino are at risk from unplanned, mistimed pregnancies due to unmet needs for modern FP (NDHS 2013). 

The passage of the Responsible Parenthood and Reproductive Health (RPRH) Act of 2012 (RA 10354), mandated the universal proVision of reproductive health services, particularly family - planning and safe delivery services, as a means to reduce maternal mortality. Pursuant to its mandate in Section 19.2 of the RPRH Law and Rule 12 of the IRR, the Department of Health shall ensure access to modern FP services which include the inclusion of new and modern methods of PP in its national program. By broadening the range of effective modern FP methods available for clients, the DOH provides a wider set of options for couples to choose from that is consistent with their beliefs and appropriate to their health status, in order to achieve their desired family size. 

Among the new and modern methods are progestin subdermal implants. These are long-acting reversible hormonal contraceptives that inhibit ovulation by suppressing the luteinizing hormone surge. It also increases cervical mucus viscosity, making it difﬁcult for the sperm cells to pass through. The method is effective for three years upon application and has a low failure rate of 5 per 10,000 users. Progestin subdermal implants also have a high continuation rate of 84%. (Trusell J, 2011) as well as high satisfaction rating among users, along with that of intrauterine devices (Peipert et a1, 2011). 

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) consider progestin subdermal implants (Etonogestrel) as safe, effective and of good quality by issuing a Certiﬁcate of Product Registration as early as January 19, 2011. The FDA has also re—certiﬁed Etnonogestrel implants as required under the provisions of RA 10354 and Supreme Court decision in James M. Imbong, et. A1. vs Paquito N. Ochoa, et.a1. GR No. 204819.
