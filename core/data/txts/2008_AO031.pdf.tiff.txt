I. RATIONALE 

Traditional medicine throughout the world recognizes the significance of therapeutic massage in managing stress, illnesses or chronic ailments. Massage therapy is considered the oldest method of healing that applies various techniques like fixed or movable pressure, holding, vibration, rocking, friction, kneading and compression using primarily the hands and other areas of the body such as the forearms, elbows or feet to the muscular structure and soft tissues of the body. 

Massage therapy can lead to significant biochemical, physical, behavioral and clinical changes in massage as well as the person giving the massage. It contributes to a higher sense of general well-being. Recognizing this, many health care professionals have begun to incorporate massage therapy as a complement to their routine clinical care.’I Efficacy of massage therapy in patient ranges from preterm neonates to senior citizens. Although the country has the training standards and regulations through the Technical Education and Skills Development Authority (TESDA), it lacks control I regulations over the training institutions, thus, anyone who calls him/herself a massage therapist is one, regardless of training or experience. 

The Department of Health created the Committee of Examiners for Massage Therapy (CEMT) to regulate the practice of massage therapy in accordance to the provisions of the Sanitation Code of the Philippines (PD 856) and Executive Order No. 102 5.1999, Reorganization and Streamlining of the Department of Health. it provides the CEMT the function to ensure that only qualified individuals enter the regulated profession and that the care and services which the massage therapists provide are within the standards of practice. 

To effectively carry out the provisions of Section XIII of PD 856 -—- “Massage Clinics and Sauna Bath Establishments”, the need to regulate potential training providers and training institutions for massage therapy is necessary for the enhancement and maintenance of its professional standards.
