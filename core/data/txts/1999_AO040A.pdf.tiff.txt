I. INTRODUCTION

Iodine deficiency disorders (IDD) comprise a group of preventable nutritional deficiencies of public health importance. A 1993 national nutrition survey conducted by the Food and Nutrition Research Institute (FNRI) revealed that the national goiter prevalence has doubled from 3.5 % in 1987 to 6.7 % in 1993 among subjects 7 years of age or older (WHO critical cut-off level is 5 %). Significant IDD has been identified in sixty percent (60 %) of the country’s provinces. Over one-fourth of pregnant and lactating women were found to be deficient. Results of a DOH-DECS study during the same year disclosed a goiter prevalence rate of 12.6 % among Grades I and II elementary school children. Another survey showed that 32% of neonates were deficient in iodine as indicated by high thyroid stimulating hormone in cord blood (Fabella Hospital survey, 1992).

In 1998, the inter-seetoral IDD Experts Group advised that iodized oil capsule (IOC) supplementation be deferred until the results of the national nutrition survey during that year are known. FNRI sampled children 6-12 years of age using urinary iodine excretion (UIE) level as indicator in order to assess IDD prevalence. Only three of the sixty-nine provinces surveyed (4 %) had normal median UIE levels (100 ug/L or higher) The overwhelming majority were IDD—endemic.

Cognizant of the detrimental effects of IDD in the physical, mental and social status of Filipinos, the Department of Health has committed to eliminate this nutritional deficiency in the country. Initial efforts centered on iodized oil capsule supplementation which was given universally to targetted asymptomatic women and routinely to frank goiter cases. International health managers however recognize the higher cost and short—term utility of supplementation as an intervention. Hence, the government is presently fast—tracking the implementation of the more cost-effective food fortification strategies particularly iodization of raw salt. Universal salt iodization (USI) is a means to eliminate IDD in lieu of IOC supplementation.

Current government initiatives focus on the promotion of iodized salt consumption and the strengthening of monitoring of salt producers/importers/traders, salt retailers, food manufacturers and food establishments relative to their compliance with Republic Act 8172 (ASIN Law). This law mandates the iodization of all salt intended for human and animal consumption. Pursuant to its implementation, the Local Government Units (LGU) have been identified as indispensable partners in ensuring the success of the National Salt Iodization Program.

It is in this context that the Kristal Award was conceptualized. It aims to solicit participation of and give due credit to LGUs actively involved in salt iodization activities. Recent government goals aim to achieve at least 50 % USI in the country by the end of 1999 and 100 % by the end of 2000. The combined efforts of national and local government entities toward a common objective is envisioned to provide the needed thrust in eliminating IDD nationwide.


II. IMPLEMENTING GUIDELINES


1. Period and Area Coverage

1.1 For 1999, the contest period for the Kristal Award shall be from September to November 1999. Winners shall be announced during the Garantisadong Pambata: Preschoolers Health Week Part II activity (GP II) in November. Only qualified LGUs from the National Capital Region (NCR) shall be evaluated for the contest in 1999.

1.2 From year 2000 onwards, the Kristal Awards shall be held annually. Contest period shall be from May to October of each year. Awarding ceremonies shall be conducted during ASAP. Qualified LGUS from all regions nationwide may be nominated.


2. Levels of Competition

2.1 Regional-Level Competitions

The regional-level competitions shall be supervised by the concerned Regional Health Oﬁice through the creation of a Regional Steering Committee and its three (3) Regional Working Subcommittees for the Kristal Award (namely, a Technical and Evaluation Subcommittee, Logistics Subcommittee, and a Publicity and Promotions Subcommittee) and
in consultation with the National Steering Committee and its three (3) National Working Subcommittees.

For 1999, only the National Capital Region shall conduct regional-level contests. From year 2000 onwards, all Regional Health Offices shall hold regional-level competitions. Similarly, a Regional Steering Committee and Regional Working Subcommittees shall be created by each RHO to oversee the conduct of the Kristal Award.

2.2 National-Level Competition

The National Task Force on Salt Iodization shall create a National Steering Committee and National Working Subcommittees for the Kristal Awards to oversee its implementation. For 1999, there shall be no national—level contest. From year 2000 onwards, regional winners shall compete for the national awards.


3. Category, Subcategories and Maximum Number of Nominees

The LGU category for the awards shall be further subdivided into the following subcategories:

3.1 For 1999, only NCR shall submit nominations to the National Technical and Evaluation Subcommittee (TES) for initial review of entries. These nominees shall be a maximum of 3 cities, 3 municipalities and 6 barangays. A nominated barangay may or may not come from nominated municipalities or cities. 

3.2 From year 2000 onwards, all Regional Health Offices shall submit nominations which shall be a maximum of 1 province (except for NCR), 3 cities, 3 municipalities and 6 barangays. Similarly, a barangay may be nominated even if its parent municipality or city is not nominated. Also, a nominated municipality or city may not necessarily come from a
nominated province. 

4. Reward System

For each subcategory (barangay, municipality, city or province) under the LGU category, 1 winner and 2 runners-up will be selected. This applies to both regional and national levels. All will receive trophies during awarding ceremonies in recognition of their performance. The other finalists will receive plaques of recognition.

Additionally, the names of both winners and non—winning nominees at regional competitions shall be published in widely—circulated regional or provincial newspapers while those at the national competition shall be published in major national dailies. Other forms of media such as local or national radio or television shall be utilized to announce winners.


5. Criteria for Selection of Winners

A set of criteria with corresponding statistical weighted score (point system) has been established in order to aid evaluators in choosing winners. These criteria shall apply to both regional and national competitions.
<image>table_1.png</image>

5.1 Each nominated LGU shall have passed or at the very least filed an ordinance supporting the ASIN Law. Specifically, the ordinance shall be known as Intensification of the Use of Iodized Salt in the province/ city / municipality of (Name) . It shall express a policy of active participation in the program of eliminating iodine deficiency disorders and shall cover salt producers/importers/traders, salt retailers, food manufacturers and food establishments. It shall stipulate the development and implementation of a promotional plan on the use of iodized salt, the conduct of periodic monitoring of the quality of iodized salt produced, distributed or consumed within the area as well as the imposition of sanctions upon violators of the ASIN Law.

5.2 The LGU shall have put in-place a system for monitoring which shall be in accordance with disseminated BFAD guidelines and shall be applicable to salt producers/importers/traders (especially medium and big-scale businesses), salt retailers (groceries, supermarkets, wet markets, sari—sari stores, etc.) as well as food manufacturers (makers of food with salt as ingredient must use iodized salt unless the sensory quality [taste, color, etc.] of the finished product is affected) and food establishments (hotels, restaurants, canteens, etc.) The system shall actively involve local health offices and personnel (local nutritionist-dietitians, food and drug regulation officers, sanitary inspectors, etc.) It shall be used to determine the level of compliance with the ASIN Law as well as give warnings to or impose sanctions upon violators of the law. Subcriteria include the regularity of monitoring activities (at least twice a year) as well as logistical support provided by the LGU for monitoring purposes (transportation, reproduction of monitoring forms, etc.).

5.3 Nominated LGUs shall have formulated and implemented intensive promotional and advocacy activities related to the ASIN Law. Said activities may imply that LGU support (funds, etc.) may have been provided to conduct such events. Innovativeness in promoting the use of iodized salt shall be recognized such as the use of local social gatherings or religious services to convey health messages, or the production of local promotional materials such as radio/TV/cinema plugs, posters, flyers, stickers, streamers, billboards, etc. An increase in the number of promotional activities compared to the previous year as well as the extent of coverage of information dissemination (materials must reach far-flung areas/establishments) shall also be considered.

5.4 The LGU shall have a high proportion (percentage) of compliance with the ASIN Law among its salt and food businesses, i.e., salt producers/importers/traders (especially medium and big scale), salt retailers, food establishments and food manufacturers in the area. This indicator necessitates the establishment and maintenance of an updated registry of the actual number of these salt and food businesses, whether complying with the ASIN Law or not. This proportion shall be initially computed by local health personnel (e.g., sanitary inspectors, heads of unit, etc.) subject to validation by the evaluation subcommittee. The type of disciplinary actions taken (referral, warnings or sanctions) relative to non-compliance shall be noted. 

For 1999, the proportions computed by local health personnel in NCR shall be submitted to the Regional Technical and Evaluation Subcommittee (TES) which will forward the data to the National TES for classification, i.e., the computed proportions of LGUs in NCR shall be categorized into 3 classes (low, medium and high proportion), the class interval of which shall be determined statistically by the National TES. (Regional TES must submit computed LGU proportions to the National TES c/o Nutrition Service). Once classified, the National TES will convey the classification data back to the Regional TES for consolidation of LGU scores. It is the National TES, rather than the Regional TES, which is tasked in classifying LGU proportions into low, medium or high (both at regional- and national-level contests).

For example, computed proportions of salt producers/importers/traders that fall within the class interval 21-30 % shall be classified by the National TES as ‘medium’ for 1999. Such interval will vary yearly based on annual field data submitted by NCR. From 2000 onwards, the same scheme shall be utilized by all RHOs in order to classify computed LGU proportions as low, medium or high.

5.5 Bach nominated LGU shall likewise have a high household utilization rate for iodized salt. This shall utilize the Lot Quality Assurance Sampling (LQAS) technique which determines whether a barangay has passed (high) or failed to achieve (low) a certain critical LQAS value that measures utilization rate. The technique involves collaborative efforts among sources of salt samples (household head for urban areas, schoolchildren for rural areas), sample collectors (Barangay Health Workers for urban, schoolteachers for rural), and sample testers (BHWs for urban, both BHWs and schoolteachers for rural).

Subcriteria include the regularity in conducting LQAS (which ideally must be twice yearly), the sample size used in LQAS which must be in accordance with that articulated in the Community-Based Salt Monitoring Manual (the bigger the number of households sampled, the less the sampling error), and the proportion of barangays in that LGU which pass LQAS standards (computed as the number of barangays passing LQAS divided by the total number of barangays in that LGU which conducted LQAS x 100. For 1999, the proportion is deemed high if it is 50 % passing or more, low if it is 49 % or less). The Regional TES is tasked in classifying LQAS proportions as high or low. 


6. Contest Mechanics

6.1 The mechanics for the conduct of the Kristal Award shall be disseminated to all regions. (For 1999, the contest shall be limited to NCR only. All regions may join the contest from year 2000 onwards).

6.2 Each region shall submit nominees for the different subcategories (barangay, municipality, city or province) according to the maximum number of nominees allowed for each subcategory. Nominations shall be submitted to the National Technical and Evaluation Subcommittee (TES) c/o the Nutrition Service of the Department of Health.

6.3 The national TES shall conduct a review of entries submitted by the different regions for initial validation of these nominees using available data files at the Central Office (LQAS accomplishments, proportion of medium and big salt producers or food establishments complying with the ASIN Law, etc).

6.4 Field validations and evaluations shall be conducted by the TES. At regional—level contests, the regional TES shall evaluate barangay, municipal, city and provincial nominees. During the national contest, regional winners for the different subcategories will, in turn, be assessed by zonal teams deployed by the national TES. A total of four zonal teams (each zone is made up of several regions) composed of staff from BFAD and the Nutrition Service of the Department of Health will evaluate nominees nationwide. Prescribed individual (i.e., per nominee — Form 1) and consolidated (i.e., all nominees - Form 2) evaluation forms shall be disseminated for use of both regional and national TES evaluators.

6.5 Evaluation results shall be processed by the regional TES for regional-level contests and by the national TES for the national contest. The TES shall be guided by the aforementioned criteria for the selection of winners and the corresponding weighted score for each criterion. 

The regional TES shall ensure that computed proportions (percentage of salt and food businesses complying with the ASIN Law in that LGU) will be forwarded to the national TES early enough for classification into low, medium or high. The classification will be relayed back to RHOs for scoring purposes. Copies of the consolidated regional evaluation results (Form 2) enumerating all nominees per subcategory and the corresponding scores per evaluator shall be sent by the regional TES to the national TES for its information.

6.6 Winners, runners-up and finalists shall be notified of the results at least 2 weeks before the awarding.

6.7 For 1999, awarding will be held in November as one of the culminating activities for GP II. From year 2000 onwards, awarding will be held in October during ASAP. Regional Health Offices shall conduct regional awarding ceremonies to recognize winners, runners-up and finalists for the different subcategories at the regional level. The National Publicity and Promotions Subcommittee of the Kristal Awards shall conduct a national awarding ceremony for national winners, runners-up and finalists.
