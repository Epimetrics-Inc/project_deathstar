<subject>SUBJECT: Implementing Rules and Regulations of Republic Act No. 9420, otherwise known as “An Act Converting Two Hundred (200) Beds of the 2000-Beds Dr. Jose N. Rodriguez Memorial Hospital and Sanitarium for Tertiary General Health Care, Appropriating Funds Therefore and for other purposes” </subject>


<body>
I. Rationale: 

The prevalence rate of leprosy in the country over the years has steadily declined, reaching the elimination target level set by the World Health Organization. This has been brought about by the effective implementation of the strategic thrusts of the Department of Health’s National Leprosy Control Program in partnership with LGU’s and Non—Government Organizations and the World Health Organization, mainly through improved case finding, case holding and the effective utilization of the Multi-Drug Therapy for all cases of leprosy. As a result of the decline in the number of leprosy cases, the Dr. Jose N. Rodriguez Memorial Hospital, along with the other seven sanitaria nationwide, had to redirect its role to respond to the ever increasing need for general health services as a result of the increase in the population of the catchment area needing general services that could be provided by the hospital. 

In 1994, then Secretary of Health Juan Flavier started his campaign on the redirection of roles of the country’s different sanitaria to be more responsive to the needs of the times considering that leprosy was no longer a major health problem. This continued up to the time of Secretary Manuel Dayrit with the lobbying in Congress for the conversion of Dr. Jose N. Rodriguez Memorial Hospital, and which eventually culminated in the passage of Republic Act No. 9420, otherwise known as "An Act Converting Two Hundred (200) Beds of the 2000-Beds of Dr. Jose N. Rodriguez Memorial Hospital and Sanitarium for Tertiary General Health Care, Appropriating Funds Therefore and for Other Purposes” authorizing the conversion of the two hundred (200) beds currently used as sanitaria of the facility into tertiary general health care.
