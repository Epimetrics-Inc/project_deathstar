<subject>SUBJECT: Additional Guidelines for the Simpliﬁed Supplier Registration System (SSRS)</subject>


<body>

In view of certain observations relative to DOH's initial implementation of the Simplified Supplier Registration System (SSRS) the following additional guidelines are henceforth to be observed:

A. Coverage of SSRS certificates

1. Suppliers with Certificates issued by the DOH Central Office Bids and Awards Committee (COBAC) shall be honored in all biddings conducted by all Centers for Health Development (CHDs) and Retained Hospitals nationwide. Certified True Copies of any of the SSRIS documents may be requested from the COBAC Secretariat.

SSRS Certificates issued by particular CHDs and hospitals shall only be valid for biddings conducted by their respective Bids and Awards Committees (BACs)

B. Period of Validity of SSRS Certificates

1. In view of the normal delay in the release of the annual Mayor's Permit and Audited Financial Statements stamped "Received" by the Bureau of Internal Revenue the period of validity of all SSRS Certificates is hereby extended from December 31 of a particular calendar year to April 30 of the succeeding year.

2. The registration of suppliers who fail to- submit their respective current Mayor’s Permit and/or Audited Financial Statements by the end of April shalt be deemed void and the said supplier shall have to apply anew for SSRS registration.
