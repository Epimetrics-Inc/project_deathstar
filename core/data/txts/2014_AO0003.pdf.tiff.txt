<subject>SUBJECT: Updated Guidelines on Strengthening Laboratory Conformation of Suspected Measles Cases </subject>
<body>



I. BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE 

In 2005, the countries of the Western Pacific Region of the World Health Organization (WHO) adopted the goal of measles elimination. To achieve this, the WHO recommends that countries strengthen three areas of their Expanded Programme for Immunization. These areas are: 1) universal high population immunity through increased coverage; 2) high case—based quality surveillance; and 3) adequate laboratory support for conformation of diagnosis. 

World Health Organization guidelines in support of the goal of measles elimination state that any person satisfying the suspect case definition of measles shall be immediately reported, investigated and a blood specimen collected to conform whether the suspected case is indeed a case of measles. Effective surveillance for measles entails establishing case—based surveillance that includes investigation and laboratory testing of specimens from all suspected cases. Such surveillance system will also identify rubella cases through laboratory conformation. As the country progresses towards measles elimination, reporting of rubella cases will be implemented and incorporated into the measles surveillance system. 

The laboratory plays an important role in measles surveillance. In the elimination phase, it is well established that surveillance based on clinical recognition of cases is inaccurate and that laboratory conformation of all suspected cases is critical for effective surveillance and proper program planning. It is in this light that conformation of suspected measles cases through laboratory testing needs to be enhanced. 

1. Monitoring and verifying virus transmission: 

-Conformation of suspect cases/ outbreaks: confirm the clinical diagnosis, especially in the early stages of an outbreak 

-Identification of measles and rubella virus . strains and genetic characteristics of viral isolates 

-Differentiate endemic or imported cases: monitor circulation of wild genotypes to define pathways of transmission/importation ' 

2. Monitoring susceptibility proﬁle of the population 

-Determination of the age distribution of susceptibility to measles and rubella in order to assess population at risk and appropriate intervention to reduce risk. 
-Evaluation of the impact of the immunization campaigns 

Quality measles surveillance requires laboratory conformation of at least 80% of the reported suspected measles cases. However, during elimination phase, all suspected measles cases require laboratory conformation. This shall serve as the evidence of the country’s achievement and maintenance of the elimination status. 

11. OBJECTIVES A. General Objective: 

To update the guidelines for strengthening laboratory conformation of suspect measles cases in support of the goal of measles elimination. 

B. Speciﬁc Objectives: 

To strengthen measles case-based surveillance To strengthen detection of rubella cases through measles surveillance and laboratory conformation 

-To evaluate impact of the measles and rubella routine and supplemental immunization activities in interrupting measles transmission and achieving control of rubella through efficient laboratory conformation

-To establish the use of dried blood spot (DBS) as an alternative method of sample collection for serology

-To require the collection of nasopharyngeal swab (NPS) and orcpharyngeal swab (OPS) from all chains of measles transmission for virus isolation 

-To implement standards for the collection, handling, storage and transport of DB8 and NPS/OPS samples 

III. SCOPE AND COVERAGE 

This issuance shall apply to the entire health sector, to include public and private health facilities both at the national and local government units involved in disease surveillance and response activities (refer to AO. No. 2007-0036: Guidelines on the Philippine Integrated Disease Surveillance and Response).

V. DECLARATION OF POLICIES 

A. Global Immunization Vision Strategy (GIVS) proposed a new measles mortality reduction of 90% by 2010 with the following major challenges: (i) measles mortality reduction activities in several large countries with high measles burden, (ii) enhanced efforts are needed to improve immunization systems to ensure that at least 95% of infants are vaccinated with measles before their ﬁrst birthday, (iii) continue conduct “follow-up” SIAs every 3-4 years until their routine system are capable of providing two opportunities for measles immunization to >90% of every birth cohort, (iv) disease surveillance at district, provincial and national levels need to be strengthened to enable case-based surveillance with testing of clinical specimens from suspected cases in the laboratories. This was endorsed in the World Health Assembly 2005 - 

B. In 1996, the Regional Office of the Western Pacific (WPRO) established a “Plan of Action (POA) for Accelerated Measles Control”. By 2003, the region’s vision had moved to elimination with the publication of the “Western Pacific Regional POA for Measles Elimination”, that covered the years 2003- 2005. The Regional Office published the Field Guidelines for Measles Elimination in 2004 and in 2005, a second Regional Committee (RC) resolution established 2012 as the target date for measles elimination 

C. In light of the proven efficacy and safety of the Regional Advisory (RA) 27/3 bases rubella vaccine, WHO recommends its use in all countries where control or elimination of Congenital Rubella Syndrome (CRS) is considered a public health priority. Current efforts in global measles control shall be used as an opportunity to pursue control of rubella through the use of Measles Rubella (MR) and Measles Mumps Rubella (MMR) vaccines 

D. WHO-UNICEF comprehensive strategy for reducing measles mortality among priority countries with the following goals: (1) achieving and maintaining high coverage (>90%) of the lSt dose of measles-containing vaccine (MCVl) among all children by the age of 12 months in every district through routine immunization services, (ii) ensuring that all children receive a second opportunity for measles immunization, (iii) enhancing measles surveillance with integration of epidemiological and laboratory information, and (iv) providing appropriate clinical management for measles cases 



VI. IMPLEMENTING MECHANISM 

The primary function of the laboratory in measles surveillance is confirming suspect measles cases, either through serology, molecular detection of the virus or virus isolation. The testing of serum specimen for the presence of anti- measles IgM antibodies remains the gold standard for laboratory conformation of suspect cases occurring both sporadically, in clusters or during outbreaks. Other means of conformation includes testing of DB8 for presence of anti-measles IgM antibodies and/or culture and isolation of measles virus from suspect or clinically confirmed measles cases. 

In countries with measles elimination goal and implementing case-based surveillance, the recommendation is to collect either serum or DBS specimen within the ﬁrst 28 days of rash onset from all suspect measles cases. While the collection of NPS/ OPS specimen for viral isolation must be within the ﬁrst 7 days of rash onset. Viral isolation provides evidence of elimination of indigenous measles virus, including outbreak source and transmission pathways. 

A. Laboratory Procedures for Case Conformation 

1. Use of Serum Samples for Measles IgM testing 

A single serum sample obtained at the ﬁrst contact with the patient at am time within 28 days after rash onset shall be taken from ALL suspected measles ca_ses. Measles-speciﬁc IgM antibodies appear within the ﬁrst few days of rash onset and decline rapidly after one month. Specimen shall be received at RITM within 72 hours after collection with the completely filled-up Measles Case Investigation Form (Annex A.). 

Provided that the epidemiological linkage among cases has been established within a household, specimen shall be taken from the index case (ﬁrst person that ﬁt the case definition of suspected measles case). 

In line with this, it is very important to identify accurate information regarding the exposure history of suspect measles case. The CIF shall contain basic epidemiological information on time, date, place and history of contact with a known measles case. This will help identify origin and path of measles virus transmission. 

Patients admitted at hospital facilities and those DRUs (RHUlHealth Centers) that have the capacity to collect, store and transport shall have serum sample collected. Procedures for collection, storage and transport of sample are contained in the Annex B. 

2. Use of alternative sample for Measles IgM detection (dried blood spot) 

Dried blood spot samples shall ONLY be used as an alternative means of specimen collection where there is difficulty in extracting blood (e.g. very young infants, no medical technologist or certified phlebotomist), maintaining the specimen at 2—8°C during storage and transport (i.e. selected island barangays, municipalities or RHUs, and provinces, lack of specimen storage facilities and no local courier). Collection shall be done by medical, paramedical and other trained personnel (doctors, medical technologists, nurses, midwives, etc). 

3. Use of Oropharyngeal and/or Nasopharyngeal swab for virus isolation 

Aside from serum, it is also important to collect NPS/OPS for virus isolation from all clusters/outbreaks of suspected measles cases within 7 days from rash onset. 

In collecting NPS/OPS, the response team shall consider the guide below in collecting samples of cases in a cluster/ outbreak: 

3 cases - collect at least 1-2 samples 

5 cases - collect a minimum of 3 samples 

10 cases —— collect a minimum cf 5 samples 

>= 10 cases - collect a minimum of 10 samples 

Virus isolation is significant to conform whether the transmissions of indigenous measles strains have been interrupted. This shall provide evidence that the country has achieved measles elimination goal.
