TO: All Regional Health Directors and Chiefs of Hospitals under the Ministry of Health

<subject>SUBJECT: Implementation of the Manual for Medical Record Procedures</subject>

<body>
Under Ministry Order No. 31-A dated February 4, 1980, a Committee has been created to revise the Manual for Medical Records including Medical Record forms for hospitals. Medical records constitute vital documents that will enable doctors, nurses and paramedical staff to provide consistent optimum care to patients. They also constitute an accurate memory of hospital works which are of significant and long lasting value not only to the hospital but also to the nationwide delivery of health care by our Ministry.

Accordingly, the attached Manual of Medical Record of Procedures is hereby formulated for the information, guidance, reference and strict implementation in all hospitals under the Ministry of Health.

This Order takes effect upon approval.
