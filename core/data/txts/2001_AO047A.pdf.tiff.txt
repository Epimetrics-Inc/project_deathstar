<body>
Republic Act 3720, otherwise known as the "Food, Drugs and Devices, and Cosmetic Act", as amended by the Executive Order 175, states that it is the policy of the state to ensure the safety, efficacy and quality of drug supply to protect the health of the people. The following rules and regulations of imported and locally produced vaccines and biologic products are hereby adopted and promulgated for the information, guidance and compliance of all concerned.

SECTION I. DEFINITION OF TERMS

The following definitions are adopted:

1.1. "Biologic" or "Biologic Product" means any attenuated or inactivated virus or bacteria, or sub—components attached to adjuvants, toxoids, hyperimmune serum and analogous products applicable to diagnosis, prevention, treatment or cure of disease or injuries to man, obtained or derived from living matter - animals, plants or microorganisms, or parts thereof. It includes preparations primarily designed to develop a type of immunity or preparations that are concerned with immunity.

1.2. "Certificate of Product Registration (CPR)" is a document issued by the Bureau of Food and Drugs (BFAD) for the purpose of marketing, use or free distribution of a product in the Philippines.

1.3. "Permit for Clinical Investigational Use (PCIU)" is a registration document issued by the BFAD for the purpose of allowing the conduct of Phase I, Phase II and Phase III clinical trials of developmental or investigational biologic products in the country.

1.4. "Developmental or Investigational Vaccine or Biologic" refers to a vaccine or biologic product that needs or is undergoing pre-clinical and clinical studies to determine its safety, potency, efficacy, and therapeutic/prophylactic value. It refers to a vaccine or biologic product which has never been registered or licensed by any National Regulatory Authorities.

1.5. "National Regulatory Authority (NRA)" is the designated national control authority of vaccines and biological products of the exporting country or country of origin that meets the criteria established by the World Health Organization (WHO), such as having a documented licensing system and GMP guidelines, GMP inspectors, and the administrative capacity to validate and issue the required certificates to other national regulatory authorities. It sets the standards and requirements to which all manufacturers of vaccines and biological products are required to conform.

1.6. "New Vaccine or Biologic" refers to a vaccine or biologic product which has undergone adequate Phases I, II, and III clinical studies, but which requires a Phase IV clinical studies. It refers to a vaccine or biologic product which has never been registered or licensed by any NRA for general use.

1.7. "Established Vaccine or Biologic" refers to a vaccine or biologic product which has undergone adequate Phase I, II, III and IV clinical studies. In addition, it has been reviewed by the WHO Expert Committee on Biological Standardization and has recommended sets of general and specific guidelines and requirements for the manufacture, control, and product evaluation for registration or licensing by a national regulatory authority.

1.8. "Shared Product" refers to a finished product whose final phase of production, including labeling, is done by a local manufacturer using biological materials, including naked or bulk biologic products, produced by another manufacturer. It also refers to a finished product whereby some of the active components, as in mixed vaccines, were processed by another manufacturer or laboratory. A shared product is a locally produced or manufactured biologic product.

1.9. "Specifications of Product" are the values and conditions of a product based on submitted documents and information that have been accepted by the BFAD.

1.10. "Locally Manufactured Product" refers to biologic products, as bulk or finished products, that were produced or manufactured in the Philippines.

1.11. "Reevaluation" means the reexamination of the quality, efficacy, safety, therapeutic/prophylactic value, and rational use of all vaccines and biological products during the renewal of the CPR.

1.12. "Applicant for Clinical Trial Protocol Approval" - The applicant for clinical trial protocol approval shall mean the sponsor of the clinical trial as defined by the International Committee on Harmonization (ICH) or the WHO Code of GOP. The sponsor or applicant may be any person connected with a licensed drug establishment or any institution, such as hospitals and research institutes.

1.13. "Good Laboratory Practice (GLP)" - Good Laboratory Practice are standards and procedures whereby the laboratory achieves a defined, consistent and reliable standard in performing laboratory test and activities.

1.14. "Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP) - Good Manufacturing Practice is that part of quality assurance which ensures that products, including vaccines and biologics, are consistently produced and controlled to the quality standards appropriate for their intended use, including all phases of vaccine clinical trials, and as required by registration and marketing authorization. For supplementary guidelines for the manufacture of investigational pharmaceutical products for human studies, refer to WHO/PHARM/94.571.

1.15. "Good Clinical Practice (GCP)" - Good Clinical Practice are standards and procedures for clinical trials that encompass the design, protocol approval, conduct, monitoring, termination, audit, analyses, reporting, and documentation of human studies. It defines the responsibilities and activities of the sponsor, principal investigator and monitor involved in clinical trials. The Code of GCP ensures that the studies are scientifically and ethically sound, and all the clinical properties of the product under investigation are properly documented. For complete information, reference is made to the published WHO and the ICH Code of Good Clinical Practice.

1.16. "Phase I Clinical Vaccine Trial " - Phase I clinical vaccine trial is an initial test of investigational vaccine in healthy adult volunteers and, occasionally, in actual patients. The number of subject is small. Safety evaluation, tolerability, immune response and dose findings are the primary objectives, and attempt is made to establish the approximate levels of patient tolerance for single or multiple dosing. The trial is done in the country of origin of the product. A comparison group may receive the adjuvant as a placebo.

1.17. "Phase II Clinical Vaccine Trial" - Phase II clinical vaccine trial is a study designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety based on dose/response, tolerability and acceptance of the investigational vaccine or combination vaccine in a small number of a selected pOpulation for whom the vaccine or combined vaccine is intended. The trial consists of two parts. The first part, known as Phase II a, consists of a selected population that is artificially challenged. The second part, known as Phase II b, consists of a selected population that harbors natural infection. A larger subject is enrolled in the second part. The studies are randomized double-blind placebo—controlled.

1.18. "Phase III Clinical Vaccine Trial" - Phase III clinical vaccine trial is a study for the population at risk. The primary objective is to evaluate the efficacy, safety, tolerability, and acceptance in a larger target population (community in situ) while monitoring for rare side effects or adverse events. Different clinical endpoints shall be determined and established. The number of subject required may vary, but are usually of larger sample size.

An Extended Phase III Clinical Vaccine Trial may be considered. This involves larger number of participants and under normal conditions of use (open population). Assessment of additional endpoints to determine immune response vs. protection, efficacy in different subgroups, effects on mortality, efficacy under controlled trials vs. effectiveness under routine use, required information to recommend vaccination on a routine basis, logistics for mass vaccination and evaluation for alternatives, effects on severity relapses, rare side effects or events, and establish the duration of protection are usually undertaken.

1.19. "Phase IV Clinical Vaccine Trial" - Phase IV clinical vaccine trial is a mandatory PMS study of newly registered biologic products or combined vaccines for a period of five years. The primary objective is to determine and establish the public health impact of the vaccine or combined vaccine - epidemiological impact on infectious and non-infectious disease(s) and the impact in terms of acceptance.

In a Phase IV Clinical Vaccine Trial, which may include the extended phase III clinical trial as part of it, the following are some of the specific objectives: to determine and establish the efficacy of different vaccination schedules (doses and intervals), long-term antibody kinetics vs. protection, evaluation under different conditions, prediction/modeling in transmission/protection social acceptability if repeated vaccination is required, and surveillance strategies (e.g. before-after trend analysis vs. stepped wedge design).

1.20. "Institutional Ethics Committee (IEC)" or "Institutional Ethics Review Board (IERB)" shall refer to the body formed by an establishment or institute which ensures that the activities of the researchers and support staff engaged in the conduct of research involving humans subjects are ethically and scientifically sound.

1.21. "Deviation Report" - Deviation report is a written document prepared by the principal investigator and submitted to the monitor, sponsor, IEC and the BFAD which details departures from protocol parameters which affect the results or outcome of a clinical trial or from the elements of GCP. The report shall contain the deviation made from established procedures, GCP and for established tolerance, and the reasons for making such deviation.

1.22. "Incident Report" - An Incident report is a written document prepared by the principal investigator submitted to the monitor, sponsor, IEC and BFAD which details any unforeseen, unexpected, rare, unusual, and life-threatening adverse reactions or adverse events, or process and procedures performed incorrectly, such as injection of vaccines, which may affect the health of the subject or put the  health of the subject at risk. The report shall include the incident that happened, the action taken, justification of the action, significance to the result of the clinical study, and remedial actions, among others.

1.23. "Amendment of Protocol" - Amendment of protocol means any changes in the protocol as approved by the BFAD, such as procedures, personnel, steps, process, equipment, facility, clinical trial site, and subject.

1.24. "Summary Lot or Batch Protocol" is a document for each lot or batch of biologic and vaccine product that contains the following: a) the summary information on the final lot or batch, b) the detailed information of manufacture and control, c) the manufacturer's certification to release the lot or batch, and d) the Certificate of Lot or Batch Release issued by the National Regulatory Authority (NRA). The WHO EXpert Committee on Biological Standardization has published Technical Report Series which set out a pro forma of the summary lot or batch protocol for each vaccine.

The Certificate of Lot or Batch Release or Lot or Batch Release Certificate is a document for each lot or batch of a vaccine or biologic product issued by the NRA of the exporting country or the country of origin. It is part and parcel of a Summary Lot or Batch Protocol, and is accompanied by the following: a) a label of the final container approved by the NRA of the exporting country or country of origin, and b) an instruction leaflet or product insert for users approved by the NRA of the exporting country or country of origin.

1.25. "Batch" or "Lot" is a defined quantity of starting materials or product manufactured in a single process or series of processes into a final dispensed product having identical risks of contamination and expected to be homogenous. In the case of continuous manufacture, the batch or lot must correspond to a defined fraction of the production, characterized by its intended homogeneity.
