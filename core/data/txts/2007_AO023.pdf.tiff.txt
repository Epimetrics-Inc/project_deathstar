<subject>SUBJECT: Schedule of Fees for the One-Stop Shop Licensure System for Hospitals</subject>


<body> 

I. Background / Rationale

The restructuring and rationalization of fees of regulatory offices is one of the strategies identified to support and sustain the needed reforms in health regulation under Fourmula One (F1) for Health. A rationalized fee schedule, coupled with an income retention policy and performance—based fund allocation, is expected to improve the efficiency, quality of services and client-responsiveness of regulatory offices.

The Department of Health (DOH) regulatory bureaus have taken measures to rationalize their schedules of fees for regulatory services. The Bureau of Health Facilities and Services (BHFS), for example, has issued A.O. 2007-0001, which prescribed a new schedule of fees that was based on the actual costs of services that are to be rendered.

The establishment of the One-Stop Shop Licensure System for Hospitals now requires the issuance of a single license to operate (LTO). The LTO shall now encompass the operation of the hospital as well as its ancillary and other facilities including, but not limited to, the following: clinical laboratory, HIV testing, drinking water analysis and drug testing; blood bank, blood collection unit and blood station; dialysis clinic; ambulatory surgical clinic; pharmacy; and medical x-ray facility. However, hospital-based medical facility for overseas workers and seafarers, hospital-based drug abuse treatment and rehabilitation center, facility using radioactive material that are currently regulated by the Philippine Nuclear Research Institute and performance of kidney transplantation are excluded in the One-Stop Shop Licensure System. Under this system, a single license application fee shall be imposed, which shall be a composite fee that shall cover the license application for the hospital as well as its ancillary and other services.

II. Objective

This Order prescribes the schedule of fees in relation to the licensure of hospitals, their ancillary and other facilities under the One-Stop Shop Licensure System.

III. Scope

This Order shall apply to hospitals applying for an LTO under the One-Stop Shop Licensure System.

IV. General Guidelines

A. Licensee

Hospitals shall be required only a single LTO that would cover for their basic, ancillary and other facilities. The fees for such LTO shall be imposed based on the schedule of fees, as provided for by this Order. Ancillary and other facilities include, but are not limited to, the clinical laboratory, HIV testing, drinking water analysis and drug testing; blood bank, blood collection unit and blood station; dialysis clinic; ambulatory surgical clinic; pharmacy; and medical x—ray facility; but exclude hospital-based medical facility for overseas workers and seafarers, hospital-based drug abuse treatment and rehabilitation center, facility using radioactive material that are currently regulated by the Philippine Nuclear Research Institute and performance of kidney transplantation.

B. Fee Exemptions

Pursuant to Republic Act 4226 Hospital Licensure Act, government hospitals are exempt from payment of registration fee and basic LTO fee for hospitals. But for ancillary and other facilities and services, non-DOH government hospitals are required to pay the corresponding fees, except for the pharmacy fee. DOH hospitals shall be exempt from payment of registration fee, basic LTO fee for hospitals, as well as the corresponding fees for ancillary and other facilities and services covered by the One-Stop Shop Licensure System.
