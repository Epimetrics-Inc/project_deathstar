<subject>SUBJECT: Guidelines for the Implementation of the 2017 Medical Assistance Program (MAP) in DOH Hospitals and Other Selected Government Health Facilities </subject>


<body>
I. RATIONALE 

The Philippine Health Agenda (PHA) 2016-2022, seeks to ensure ﬁnancial protection for all Filipinos. In 1995, the Philippine Health Insurance Corporation (PhilHealth) was created to provide the National Health Insurance Program (NHIP) on a universal coverage. However, a signiﬁcant proportion of Filipinos continue to have no access to adequate health services due to ﬁnancial reasons. Because of low compliance rate of 40-50% to the DOH No Balance Billing Policy and uniform Costing of PhilHealth beneﬁts, high out-of-pocket expense at an average of 56% of the total health expenditure was estimated in 2013. 

Thus, pursuant to Section 13 of the General Appropriations Act of 2017, the Assistance to Indigent Patients Budget shall ﬁnd the Medical Assistance Program (MAP) of the Department of Health (DOH) to provide ﬁnancial assistance to poor and indigent patients seeking medical services in government health facilities. 

Administrative Order No. 2016-0010 entitled “Revised Guidelines for the Implementation of the Medical Assistance Fund Program in Government Hospitals Starting 2016” has not explicitly discussed the role of PhilHealth and other ﬁnancing programs. Overlaps of these different sources of funds make the system prone to fraud and weaken the purchasing power of PhilHealth, leading to inefﬁcient fund utilization and ultimately, hindering the achievement of full ﬁnancial risk protection. 

Hence, there is a need to redirect the ﬁnancing provisions of MAP and to expand and align its coverage with the thrusts of DOH. The revised guidelines will position MAP to supplement and augment provisionally, but not duplicate other existing health ﬁnancing schemes to ensure that all Filipinos are provided with adequate health care service. 

II. OBJECTIVES
