<subject>SUBJECT: Amendment to A0 93 s. 2003 and A0 No. 2007-0008 entitled, “Allowable Rates of Payment for Health Roman Resource Development Activitig of the Department of Health”</subject>


<body>

The existing policy of the Department of Health (DOH) on allowable rates of payment for health human resource development (Hl-IRD) activities limits access to quality and suitable venue for the conduct of the said activities. With this, the comfort and quality of food for the participants were compromised in order to squeeze in the allowable rates for the residential and non—residential HI-IRD allowances.

Based on a quick nationwide survey conducted to assess/review the prevailing rates of hotels and other facilities used as venue for the conduct of HHRD and other human resource related activities of the DOH, the allowable rates prescribed in A0 23 s. 2003 and A0 2007-0008 were no longer reasonable to ensure quality, safe and secured venues for the participants.

Thus, Section I[[ No. l of A0 93 s. 2003 and A0 200-7 ~0008 are hereby amended as follows:

Allowable rates from to
- Residential Php 1,200.00 Php 1,800.00
- Non—Residential Php 600.00 Php 800.00

With these maximum rates, proponent-s of the HHRD activities must guarantee that the following conditions are complied to ensure a conducive learning facility and an acceptable level of comfort:

1. Maximum of two per room 
2. Managed buffet 
3. Free use of conference/ﬁmction room 
4. Provision of audio-visual system
5. Free ﬂowing coffee/tea
6. Free use of internet services

However, costs beyond the approved rates may be allowed in cases of important and high level activities (e. g. international meetings, national fora/summit, and the likes) subject to the approval of the Secretary of Health or his/her authorized representative.

Lastly, it is strongly encouraged that DOH facilities and other government available venues within the area should primarily be considered and utilized in order to maximize government resources.

All other orders, rules or regulations inconsistent with these provisions are repealed accordingly.
