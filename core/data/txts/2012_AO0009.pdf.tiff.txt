<subject> Subject: National Strategy Towards Reducing Unmet Need for Modern Family
Planning as a means to Achieving MDGs on Maternal Health
</subject>

<body>

I. BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE

Today, around six million Filipino women are estimated to have unmet need for modern Family Planning (FP), either for limiting (women who want no more children) or for spacing (women who want a child after three or more years). About half a million of . these women have unplanned, unwanted, or mistirned pregnancies, that have 20 percent higher likelihood of complications during pregnancy and childbirth, including untimely deaths. This is because women with unplanned pregnancies are less likely to avail of adequate maternal care (NDHS, 2008). Unplanned pregnancies also affect the health conditions of mothers, which can lead to poor maternal and fetal outcomes. Demand and supply side factors alter rates of unmet need.

Demand side factors that inﬂuence the level of unmet need for modern FP include: (1) lack of correct information on FP methods which result in fear of side effects, myths and misconceptions, and partner’s refusal to any FP method or non-participation in decision-making process; (2) lack of information on. what, how and where FP goods or services can be accessed; (3) lack of ﬁnancial capacity to pay for FF goods and services; and (4) poor health—seeking behavior of clients. While the NDHS 2008 reported highlevel of awareness on PF (98 percent), this has not been translated into practice, in that only 34 percent reported use of any modern FP method.

On the other hand, supply side factors include: (1) inadequate availability of FF goods owing to irregular or maldistributed supply, poor logistics management; (2) inadequate number and capacity of both facilities/equipment and service providers (specially for long—acting and permanent methods or LAPM services); (3) missed opportunities during point of contact between client and information] service provider; (4) inadequate or nonsustainable budget allocation (i.e., financial and/or policy support) for FF at all levels; and (5) limited PhilHealth FP coverage and beneﬁts. 


Government-led intervention to address unmet need for modern FP is therefore necessary due to (1) inadequate and inappropriate information on FF and means to address unmet needs; (2) the serious and long-term health effects of having unplanned pregnancies; and (3) the need to minimize the costs of reducing unmet need.

In addition, the use of unmet need as the basis for developing programs and assessing progress in FP is consistent with the policy that focuses to meet needs rather than trying to change people’s
preferences on FP.



However, current efforts to address unmet need for FF remain inadequate and fall below desired targets. The 2008 NDHS reported that there were an estimated 900,000 new FP acceptors from 2003 to 2008, or an average of only about 180,000
new FP acceptors per year. At this rate, it would take the country 30 years to address the problem of unmet need in the country.

Reducing unmet need for modern FP is a critical element in attaining the MDG goal of reducing by two-thirds the maternal mortality. Attaining MDGs is part of the third strategic thrust of Kalusugan Pangkalahatan (KP), which is the administration’s execution plan meant to achieve Universal Health Care. KP provides that public health effort and resources will be focused towards areas with high concentrations of poor families listed in the NHTS-PR, where access to health services remains low. (A0 No. 2010-0036 and D0 No. 2011—0188).

II. OBJECTIVE

This Order provides for an updated and comprehensive approach to reduce unmet need for modern FP services in support of the strategic thrust to attain health—related MDGs by the year 2015, and is part and parcel of the implementation of the Aquino Health Agenda to achieve Universal Health Care as described in theKalusugan Pangkalahatan Execution Plan.

III. SCOPE AND COVERAGE

This Order shall apply to the health sector, from both the public and private sectors: DOH Central Ofﬁce, Centers for Health Development (CHDs), and DOH-retained hospitals; Central ofﬁces and regional units of the Commission on Population
(POPCOM), Philippine Health Insurance Corporation (PhilHealth), and other DOH attached agencies; LGUs as provided for in their agreements with the DOH that involve resource transfers, and DOH—ARMM as provided fOr in the Memorandum of Agreement between DOH and ARMM dated 23 April 2009; Development Partners, in
the context of their strategic agreements for health with the Government of the Philippines; private health care providers; and all others concerned.

III. DEFINITION OF TERMS

1.Community Health Team (CHT) —- a group of health volunteers having a critical role in increasing awareness on and recognition of health risks among families, promoting healthy behaviors, and prompting individuals to seek and utilize affordable and accessible health care services, particularly among poor families. DOH, DepEd, DSWD, and DILG JMC No. 2011-0073 provides for the creation of a TWG on CHTs, while DOH DM No. 2011-0286 provides for guidelines on the mobilization of CHTs. 

2.Cross-docking -— a practice in logistics management of unloading materials from the incoming bulk supplier and then loading these materials directly into outbound carriers/forwarders for direct delivery to the end distribution points, with little or no storage in between except for the time needed to obtain samples for quality control.

3. Family Development Sessions (FDS) — an integral activity of 4Ps that seeks to expand the knowledge and enhance the skills of beneﬁciary parents, in order to help them appreciate and comply with the health and education conditionalities of the
program. (DSWD Manual of Operations)

4. FP Competency-based Training (FP CBT) _ training for PP on infection prevention, client assessment, provision of certain FP methods (i.e., standard days method, hormonal contraceptives, and condoms), counseling, and FP clinic management that uses a laddered approach, exposing participants to levels of training based on developed knowledge, skills, and behavior. The modiﬁed training system, which is performance-based, develops the knowledge, attitudes, and skills of participants on the requirements of quality family planning (FP) service provision. FP CBT 1 covers knowledge on the different modern methods and skills on counseling, pills dispensing, injectable, condom insertion, and cycle beads FP methods, while CBT 2 covers IUD insertions. Specialized course on FF includes Natural Family Planning Methods, Minilaparotomy under local anesthesia (BTL), and No—scalpel vasectomy (N SV)

5. Informed Choice and Voluntarism (ICV) «— a standard in the delivery of FF services, ensuring that clients freely make their own decision based on accurate and complete information on a broad range of available modern FP methods, and not by any special inducements or forms of coercion or misrepresentation. Guidelines on ensuring compliance to ICV in the delivery of PP services are contained in DOH AO No. 2011—0005.

6. Interpersonal Communication and Counseling (IPCC) — a face-to-face, verbal and non—verbal exchange of information. Effective IPCC between health care provider and client is one of the most important elements for improving client satisfaction, compliance and health outcomes.

7. Kalusugan Pangkalahatan (KP) — also known as the Aquino Health Agenda to achieve Universal Health Care (AHA-UHC), KP is a focused approach to health reform implementation, ensuring that all Filipinos especially the poor receive the beneﬁts of health reform. KP’s three strategic thrusts are i) rapid expansion in NHIP enrollment and beneﬁt delivery using national subsidies for the poorest families; ii) improved access to quality hospitals and health care facilities through accelerated upgrading of public health facilities; and iii) attainment of the health-related MDGs by applying additional effort and resources in localities with high concentration of families who are unable to receive critical public health services. DOH AO No. 2010—0036 and DO No. 2011-0188 provide for the agenda and the execution plan to achieve UHC/KP, respectively.

8. MDG 12 Areas 4 these are sub-national areas of NHTS~PR poor households that have also been determined to have high concentrations of unmet need for public health services (including modern family planning), in accordance with DO No. 2011-0188 or the KP Execution Plan. These areas are: Metropolitan Manila, Negros Occidental, Quezon Province, Cebu Province, Pangasinan, Iloilo, Cavite, Maguindanao, Zamboanga del Sur, Leyte, Davao del Sur, and Pampanga.

9. Municipal/City Links (MleCLs) — serve as the link between the DSWD and LGUs in the over-all supervision of 4Ps implementation in municipalities/cities, in coordination with the Municipal Social Welfare and Development Ofﬁce (MSWDO), and community facilities, like schools and health centers. They monitor compliance and grievances of all stakeholders in the program. Similarly, they provide training and capability building activities to beneﬁciaries.

10. National Household Targeting System for Poverty Reduction (NHTS-PR) — an information management system that identiﬁes who and where the poor are, with its implementation being spearheaded by the DSWD. In compliance with E0 No. 867, s. 2010, the DOH as a national government agency has adopted the NHTS-PR as a mechanism in prioritizing the beneﬁciaries of its programs and projects.

11. National Online Stock Inventory Reporting System (NOSIRS) — a logistics management initiative with standard and formal reporting systems that can generate logistics information at all levels of the health care system. NOSIRS utilizes Supply Management Recording (SMR) as the recording tool to efﬁciently track the status of commodities at health facilities and hospitals nationwide.

12.Pantawid Pamilyang Filipino Program (4Ps) — a poverty reduction strategy that provides cash grants to extremely poor households to allow their family members to meet certain human development goals. The focus is on building human capital in the poorest families (through investments in their health/nutrition and education) because low schooling, ill health and high malnutrition are strongly associated with the poverty cycle in the Philippines. The 4Ps conditionalities for beneﬁciaries to remain in the program include the requirement for pregnant household members to attend at least one family planning counseling session prior to delivery, and another one within the ﬁrst six weeks after childbirth. DSWD AO No. 16, s. 2008 provides for guidelines on the implementation of 4Ps.

13.Parent Leaders (PLs) ~— a beneﬁciary parent of 4Ps who has been determined by consensus of his/her peers to be the point person between the DSWD/4Ps, the LGU , link, and the household grantees at the barangay level. The tasks of a PL include the follow-up and monitoring of attendance of household grantees in community assemblies and family development education sessions, as well as the conduct of home visits to household grantees who have not been attending the community assembly. (DSWD 4Ps Manual of Operations)

14. Priority Municipalities for Poverty Reduction (Priority 609) — these are municipalities tagged as the Aquino Government’s priority areas for poverty reduction, pursuant to NAPC MC No. 2011-001.

15. Private Sector Providers (PSPs) —- are health care providers (both for-proﬁt and not- for—proﬁt) that are not directly operated or controlled by the state or any of its instrumentalities. PSPs may be natural or juridical persons, and they may either provide health care services or goods.

16. Service Delivery Network (SDN) — refers to the network of facilities and providers within the province—wide or city-wide health system offering a core package of services (which includes modern family planning) in an integrated and coordinated manner pursuant to the MNCHN Strategy Manual of Operations (DOH DM No. 2011—0117).

17. Social and Behavioral Change Communication (SBCC) — an approach that looks at the role of communication in bringing about social change, including individual behaviors and social norms. SBCC utilizes a strategic mix of communication interventions using audience-appropriate interpersonal and mass media communication channels to engage individuals, families and communities to promote, stimulate and sustain behavior change.

18. Unmet Need for Modern Family Planning (UMFP) _. the number of women who are fecund and sexually active but are not using any modern method of contraception, and report not wanting any more children (limiting) or wanting to delay the birth of their next child (spacing).

V. STATEMENT OF POLICY

A. Filipino families have ﬁindamental, constitutional human rights to determine the number of children they want to have. Given their preferences and understanding of the health risks involved in pregnancy and delivery, Filipino families shall have access to all modern FP methods in order to allow them to determine when to have children and meet their desired family size.

B. The reduction of unmet need for modern FP shall respect the personal preferences of individuals involved. It shall be contextualized as a human rights-based intervention guided and anchored on the following principles: respect for the sanctity of life, respect for human rights, informed choice and
voluntarism (A0 No. 2011-0005), and respect for the rights of clients to determine their desired family size.

C. Modern FP shall include among its methods the following: pills; injectables/DMPA; condoms; IUDs; natural family planning/NFP (A0 N0. 132 s. 2004) including lactational amenorrhea method (LAM); bilateral tubal ligation (BTL); vasectomy (A0 N0. 50—A s. 2001); and any other method deemed to be safe and effective by the DOH. '

D. The demand for modern FP methods among the priority beneﬁciaries shall be accelerated alongside the enhanced and expanded equitable provision of PP goods and services at all levels of the health care system. A whole—of-society, client—centered and social determinants approach shall be adopted.

VI. GENERAL GUIDELINES

A. FP as a program shall be implemented at the national and local levels with the active involvement of both public and private sectors. It shall have the following key elements (RA No. 6365, Sec. 2 as amended by PD N0. 79):

1. Quantitative estimates centered on the elimination of unmet need for modern FP, used for determining logistics and budget requirements for planning purposes (A0 No. 2011-0005, provision VI.;

2. Information and education campaigns targeted to priority beneﬁciaries and delivered mainly at the interpersonal level; and
3. Provision of affordable and accessible counseling, supplies, commodities, and services of all safe and effective methods to couples desiring to space or limit family size.

B. The implementation of the FP program shall be integrated and synchronized with other public health programs/campaigns (e.g., Maternal, Neonatal, and Child Health and" Nutrition or MNCHN programs, Garaniisadong Pambata, etc.) in the broader context of the KP Execution Plan. It is expected that resources shall be optimized for joint use where applicable with other health priorities. A client-centered, life cycle approach on delivering FP services at any point of contact shall be adopted.

In particular, the following shall be accomplished:

1. Expansion of the enrollment of poor families into the NHIP. This shall include information and guidance on use of PhilHealth beneﬁts for FF through organized Community Health Teams or by some other means that is practicable and sustainable;

2. Enhancement of the service delivery network (SDN) capacity of providers for FF, especially for LAPM, by upgrading public facilities and to consider contracting private service providers where there are gaps for implementation; and

3. Fast tracking of procurement and streamlining of distribution and replenishment of goods such as pills, injectables, condoms and IUDs according to the estimates and preferences of beneﬁciaries in priority areas.

C. Informed choice and voluntarism (ICV) shall be promoted by all public or private health care providers rendering F P services. Clients shall not be denied any right or beneﬁt including the right to avail of any program of general welfare or health care, as 'a consequence of any decision regarding FP services; neither shall they be coerced to use any particular FP method.

D. Priority shall be given to delivering additional/enhanced FP services in localities that have the highest estimated unmet need for modern FP methods. Nevertheless, the delivery of additional/enhanced FP services shall be carried out such that current levels of modern FP use in priority and other areas are equitably maintained.

E. Contraceptive self-reliance shall be encouraged. Resources such as grants, supplies and commodities, and training/capacity building may be provided to the priority LGUs as lead implementers, in order to leverage for good FP program performance. LGUs that receive such support or assistance are expected to provide complementary allocations to implement health programs.

F. Interventions to reduce unmet need for modern FP shall be tailor-ﬁtted to prevailing local conditions and needs of province- or city-wide health systems, in close consultation with LGUs.

G. In highly pOpulated or urbanized areas and where there are gaps in LGU services, private sector providers (e. g., private practice health professionals,lying-in clinics/birthing facilities, non-government organization clinics, etc.) of FF goods and/or services shall be engaged through the provision of grants, commodities, and technical assistance or any other acceptable mechanism.

H. Monitoring and evaluation of progress in reducing unmet need for modern FP shall focus on indicators based on factors that inﬂuence demand and supply, and the resulting outcomes from these interventions.

I. All Social and Behavioral Change Communication (SBCC) activities for PP shall be not be independent of the overall unifying communication strategy for KP that addresses individual knowledge and behavior, collective attitudes or norms, and societal level policies and regulations.

VII. SPECIFIC GUIDELINES

A. The delivery of additional/enhanced FP services shall be executed according to the estimates of unmet need for FF in the following beneﬁciaries, in order of descending priority: I

1. NHTS-PR poor households living in MDG 12 areas;
2. NHTS-PR poor households living in the Priority 609 municipalities;
3. All other NHTS-PR poor households not included in items 1 and 2 above; and
4. Other poor households that may be identiﬁed, as a result of need or availability of resources.

B. The procurement and distribution of commodities shall be streamlined according to the following:

1. Commodities shall be procured according to the estimated needs of priority pOpulations based on the preferred method mix per age group, as determined by data on observed health-seeking behaviors using the most recent demographic health survey or its equivalent, or by some other comparable scientiﬁc method as deemed appropriate by the DOH..

2. Commodity grants to be provided to LGUs shall take into
consideration the local availability of FP commodity stock supply, strength of the private sector market, LGU commodity self-reliance activities, and the commodity assistance of development partners.

3. Supply chain management shall promote efﬁciency with the end goal of the expedited distribution of quality-checked commodities to beneﬁciary families. Towards this end, innovations such as but not limited to cross-docking of commodities shall be adopted.

4. A unified information and communication technology (ICT) solution (e.g., NOSIRS/SMR) shall be used to track commodity ﬂows in real time, from the point of initial procurement to the point of receipt by beneﬁciary families.

5. Commodity assistance or donations for PP from Development
Partners shall be coordinated with DOH, who will allocate the said commodities according to the prioritization of beneﬁciaries in this order. Donated commodities shall be reserved for distribution to
LGUs with supply gaps.

C. LGUs shall take the lead in implementing FP programs and services. Consistent with applicable provisions of AO No. 2008-0020, DOH shall provide assistance through grants, commodities, facility enhancement, technical assistance, and/or training/capacity building in the context of other
assistance packages under KP. Assistance shall be delivered through grant mechanisms that shall promote collaboration and innovation among local partners such as the private sector, labor associations, NGOs, or civil society.

D. The training/capacity building of FF providers shall proceed according to the
following:

1. Standardized training for the provision of all modern FP services shall be offered to all government/public and private sector providers at a reasonable cost (e. g., meals and accommodation, among others). Once trainees complete the prescribed courses/activities, they shall be included in the SDN of their respective areas;

2. All DOH regional medical centers are hereby designated as training centers for permanent methods of FF, such as BTL via minilaparotomy under local anesthesia (MLLA) and no scalpel
vasectomy, provided that they shall also be training centers for IUD insertion in areas where there are no preceptor sites for FF CBT Level 2; 

3. CHDs and LGU health ofﬁces shall organize and conduct FP CBT
Level 1 and natural F P training courses; and

4. Where there are gaps in public sector trainers, private sector partner training institutions/training centers shall be contracted to provide capacity building.

E. FP services are to be provided to poor families with zero co-payment on their part, consistent with KP policy on No Balance Billing (NBB). PhilHealth shall be the main source of ﬁnancing to pay for PP services, according to the terms and conditions of its beneﬁt packages for PP.

F. The upgrading of public hospitals and other health facilities shall ensure the availability of appropriate FP services according to their respective service delivery mandates, and shall be part of the hospital development plan.

G. Social and behavioral change communication (SBCC) activities shall be customized and targeted for direct delivery to beneﬁciary families at the interpersonal level, according to the following, among others:

1. Community health teams (CHTs) and other community based
volunteers shall be mobilized to conduct household visits to inform families, assist in health use planning, as well as follow-up and refer couples to appropriate health facilities/providers;

2. Parent Leaders (PL), in coordination with the DSWD and LGUs,
shall be integrated into or shall work with CHTs for mobilization to 4Ps families, including the conduct of Family Development Sessions (FDS) on responsible parenthood and family planning. Municipal

Links (ML) shall be tapped to assist in organization of PBS centered on modern FF; and

3. The conduct of outreach activities to the poor shall generate
supportive social norms for family planning, stimulate behavior
change for the utilization of modern FP methods, and provide
opportunities to serve clients (e.g., provision of mobile clinics).

H. In areas where there is signiﬁcant presence and activity of private sector providers and other stakeholders (e.g., urban areas), they may be contracted to provide and/or support FP services so that DOH, LGU, and other public sector effort and resources can be focused on isolated and hard-to reach areas (e.g. GlDAs).

1. Each province- or city-wide health system shall carry out measures to reduce unmet need for modern FP, which includes the following major steps:

1. Using the latest data on the identities and locations of the priority beneﬁciary families (i.e., lists of 4Ps families and NHTS—PR families), estimate the magnitude of unmet need for modern FP as well as the magnitude of current modern FP use.

a. The overall approach to reducing unmet need among the poor is conceptually illustrated in Annex A.

b. Annex B provides the detailed estimates of unmet need for modern FP for CY 2012, subject to validation with actual households.

2. Using the latest data on modern FP service and commodity
preferences/method mix of the population, estimate the volume and cost of required commodities and services needed by the beneﬁciary families.

3. Determine and document the inventory of available resources and capacities (budget, infrastructure, and trained personnel) for modern FP commodities and services from the central, regional, and local level, coming from the LGU, DOH, Development Partners, and private sector providers.

4. Match/assign available resources and capacities for modern F P to the beneﬁciary families’ requirements for commodities and services with the use of a geographic information system (GIS) such as Googlw Earth/Google Maps, or some other similar platform.

5. Determine commodity and service gaps, if any, and prOpose
solutions by which these gaps can be ﬁlled.

6.Designate/contract at the level of municipalitiesfbarangays public or private providers that can provide FP goods and services to the beneﬁciary families at no balance billing (NBB)  

7.Specify mechanisms for the delivery of F P services to families at the points of use, given local conditions and preferences, in consideration of both estimated unmet need and current use.

8.Coordinate the timeline of activities to meet speciﬁc targets for reduction in unmet need and maintenance of current use with
timelines at the regional and national levels.


J. The planned outcome of families using safe, affordable, and high quality FP commodities and services according to their preferences shall be achieved by ensuring that inputs (e. g., budgets, commodities, and other resources) shall lead to the necessary outputs (e. g., health use plans for FF) within a speciﬁc timeframe. An operational monitoring and evaluation system for PP servicesshall be integrated with its overall counterpart for KP, with data quality checking and adequate information systems management. In particular, CHTs shall validate the estimates of unmet need for modern FP with the expressed need of clients.
