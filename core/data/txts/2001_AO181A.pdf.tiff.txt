<subject>SUBJECT: REVISED OPERATIONAL GUIDELINES FOR THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE DOCTORS TO THE BARRIOS (DTTB) PROGRAM</subject>


<body>

I. RATIONALE

Given the reality where there is varying pace of development and inequitable distribution of scarce resource, 271 municipalities were identified in 1992 to be doctorless and lacking in the capability to provide adequate health services resulting in high mortality and morbidity rates in those areas.

The Doctors to the Barrios (DTTB) Program was created by the DOH in May 1993 to address this need. The program trained and fielded competent, compassionate and community-oriented doctors as assistance package to the identified doctorless local government units (LGUs) nationwide, mostly depressed, marginalized, remote and 5th and 6th class municipalities. To date, a total of 249 doctors have been deployed to 27% and 56% of the identified 5th and 6th class municipalities, respectively. These doctors have served 198 municipalities (some municipalities were served more than once due to exigency or service), or 73% of the targetted doctorless LGUs.

As a more recent development, several provinces are likewise suffering from inadequacy of medical/surgical care. District hospitals are undermanned by professional health workers, especially doctors, and many low-income class provinces can not find the doctors to fill up empty posts.

In this regard, the DTTB Program is being expanded to include deployment of doctors in District Hospitals (DHs). The expansion would ensure a more comprehensive approach to the improvement of the health care delivery system, to cover both the preventive and curative aspects of health care. This innovation also forms part of the upgrading of district hospitals under the District Health System Development which is a major thrust of the current DOH management.

II. OBJECTIVE

To ensure quality health care services in depressed, marginalized and unserved/underserved areas through the deployment of competent and community-oriented doctors.

III. COVERAGE

1. Depressed and marginalized municipalities without doctors for at least two (2) years
2. 3rd and 4th class municipalities needing additional doctors following the doctor to population ratio (1:20,000)
3. District hospitals in dire need of additional doctors.
4. RHUs with RHPs/MHOs on study leave.

IV. STRATEGIES

1. Partnership with the LGUs in the deployment of DTTBs.
2. Strengthening community support for local health care delivery system through the District Health System (DHS)
3. Strengthening the leadership and management capabilities of the DTTB.
4. Social preparation at the Local Government level.
5. Strengthening the management functions of Centers for Health Development.
