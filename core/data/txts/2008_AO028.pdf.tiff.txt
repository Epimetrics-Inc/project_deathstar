<body>
I. Background/Rationale

With the establishment of the One-Stop Shop System for the regulation of medical facilities for overseas workers and seafarers and non-hospital—based dialysis clinics and non—hospital-based ambulatory surgical clinics with ancillary services, the Department of Health (DOH) regulatory bureaus are moving towards the harmonization and streamlining of regulatory systems and processes, which is one of the reform strategies under the FOURmula One for Health.

One of the important features of the One-Stop Shop system is the issuance of a single license to operate (LTO) or certificate of accreditation (COA) to the health facility, for the operation of its clinical services as well as its ancillary facilities/services, such as, but not limited to, the clinical laboratory, HIV testing, drinking water analysis, pharmacy, and medical and dental x-ray facilities. The One-Stop Shop system does not include facilities using radioactive material that are currently regulated by the Philippine Nuclear Research Institute. With the single LTO or COA, there shall also be a single LTO or COA fee, which is a composite fee consisting of all the fees that correspond to each clinical and ancillary service being provided by the health facility.

The schedule of fees that is prescribed in this Order is based on existing administrative issuances on the regulatory fees for health facilities, in particular, Administrative Orders No. 2007-0001, 2007-0023 and 2008—0007. Thus, in this Order there are no new or no increase in regulatory fees for the health facilities covered by the One—Stop Shop system.
