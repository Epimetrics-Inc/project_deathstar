SIR:

Pursuant to paragraph IX of Department Order No. 285, series of 1976, dated June 7, 1976, I wish to request that the Bureau of Research and Laboratories be exempted from the limitation under the provisions of paragraph II(3)a on emergency purchase of supplies and materials and instead this Bureau be authorized to make emergency purchases not to exceed ₱20,000.00 per order. This request is being made in view of the fact that this Bureau is authorized to make direct emergency purchases of supplies and materials in the amount of ₱50,000.00 per month under Item (5) 4, page 241, P.D. No. 733, subject to the Rules and Regulations which this Bureau has issued and approved by the Secretary of Health. It has been out experience in the past that, inview of the nature of the functions of this Bureau coupled with the increase in prices of commodities, more often our purchases exceed ₱5,000.00 per order. It must be emphasized that this authority to make direct purchases has been incorporated in the Budget in order to expedite the procurement of supplies and materials needed especially for production of vaccines and sera.

Considering the foregoing premises, it is hoped that this request to authorize this Bureau to make direct emergency purchases of supplies and materials not to exceed ₱20,000.00 per order will be given due course.

Very truly yours,

V. BASACA-SEVILLA, M.D., M.P.A.
(Chief of Medical Division III)
Officer-in-Charge
