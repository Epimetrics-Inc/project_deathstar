<subject>SUBJECT: Declaring the Month of July Every Year as the Mass Treatment and Awareness Month for Schistosomiasis in the Established Endemic Areas in the Philippines </subject>


<body>
I. Background Rationale: 

Schistosomiasis is a debilitating chronic disease affecting the poor marginalized sector comprising the agricultural farmers and freshwater ﬁshermen and their families, indigenous people living atop swampy areas & lakes , residents of mountainous terrains not having sanitation facilities and potable sources of safe water , agriculture & irrigation workers and women doing their domestic work involving contact with cercarial schistosome infested fresh water. Also at high risk of getting schistosomiasis infection are wandering nomads such as indigenous peoples and those of similar culture, combat soldiers and the people living in the adjacent barangays/municipalities to endemic localities. Only 2.5 million are directly exposed to disease transmission sites but 12.5 million are estimated to be at high risk to schistosomiasis infection in 190 municipalities & 20 cities within the 28 provinces in the 12 regions of the country. 

To achieve the elimination goals set forth in the National Objectives for Health, the National Schistosomiasis Elimination Program has its main intervention - Morbidity Control through Mass Chemotherapy — to reduce disease transmission progressively, in as much as schistosomiasis infection is usually asymptomatic which is not detectable in light infections by stool (kato-katz) microscopy. Complications due to schistosomiasis are hepatosplenomegally, fibrosis , cirrhosis, some may lead to colorectal cancer, squamous cell carcinoma, and an increasing number of central nervous system involvement causing spinal and cerebral cases. Management of complications is very costly and not affordable by the poor marginalized sector. 

The schistosomicide drug Praziquantel in 600 mg scored tablet is safe and effective, with only some few observable mild reactions that are often transient which respond to symptomatic treatment (Belizario,V.Y. et al. Acta Tropica,2006) 

To contain and reduce schistosomiasis morbidities that results to irreversible sequelae, it is essential that the population directly exposed to getting the infection should receive chistosomicide treatment at least once a year to prevent complications consequent of the chronic stage of the disease. 

 
II. Objectives 

The principal objectives for declaring JULY as the Mass Treatment Month for Schistosomiasis are: 

a. To control morbidity of the exposed population 

b. To create awareness on schistosomiasis health risks among the exposed pOpulation and the necessity of a yearly schistosomicide treatment 

c. To accomplish the 85% coverage treatment of the targeted age group (5yo-65yo) of the population residing in all the endemic barangays Xpuroks. 

III. Coverage/ Scope: 

This Order shall cover all schistosomiasis endemic areas as well as those provinces with high risk of schistosomiasis infection. 

The following provinces are considered endemic for schistosomiasis and shall conduct mass treatment of the exposed population (5yo—65 years old) in all the endemic barangays

IV. General Guidelines: 

1.Mass Treatment is the primary intervention for schistosomiasis endemic areas to be done yearly in the month of July. 

2.Mass Treatment shall be done for the entire month simultaneously in all endemic areas for schistosomiasis covering school children and the population , age 5y.o.—- 65y.o. completing no less than 85% of the target population of the area covered .In the event that the population coverage has not been completed due to force majeure (ﬂoods, typhoons ) or other reasons such as peace and order problem,this activity maybe extended or rescheduled in order to complete coverage of the exposed pOpulation. The mass treatment shall be conducted for a minimum of 3 years until the elimination level is achieved (less than 1 0/o prevalence rate). 

3.Schistosomiasis Mass Treatment in school and in community will cover cover the 5— 65 years old residing in known endemic areas in the country. However for provinces that have reached the elimination level of less than 1/100,000 prevalence for ﬁve (5) consecutive years such as Bohol, Zamboanga del Norte, Davao del Sur, Surigao del Sur , mass treatment shall be conﬁned among schoolchildren only . 

4. The Praziquantel 600mg drug with proven efﬁcacy and safety, shall be the drug of choice for Schistosomiasis Mass Treatment which will be provided by the DOH to all the LGU health facilities and Mass Treatment Centers such as Schools, Barangay Multipurpose Centers, Islamic Centers and other Churches or NGO facilities that may be tapped in this month- long activity.

6.The LGU’s local health physicians and paramedical staff and volunteer workers shall take the lead in all these month long activity.
