<subject>SUBJECT : Regulation B—4 Definitions and Standards of Identity for Foods
B-4.5 Cheese and Cheese Products</subject>

<body>
I (a) Cheese is the fresh or matured product obtained from milk, cream, skimmed or partly skimmed milk, butter milk, whey or a combination of some or all of these products either by draining after coagulation or by any other method which would give the same result.

(b) Whey is the product remaining after the fat and casein have been removed from milk in the process of making cheese.

(c) Whey Cheese is the product obtained by the concentration of whey and the molding of the concentrated whey with or without the addition of milk and milk fat and contains not less than 10% of milk fat.

(d) For the purpose of this Standard, the word "milk" means cow's milk, which maybe adjusted by separating part of the fat therefrom or by adding thereto one or more of the following: Cream, skim milk, concentrated skim milk, non-fat dry milk, water in a quantity sufficient to reconstitute any concentrated skim milk or nonufat dry milk used.

(e) Cheese shall not contain any fat other than milk fat.

(f) Milk and milk products used for cheese production shall be deemed to have been pasteurized if it has been held at a temperature of not less than 61.7°C for a period of not less than 30 minutes, or for a time and at a temperature equivalent thereto in phosphatase destruction.

(g) Sufficient rennet, or other safe and suitable milk clotting enzyme that produces equivalent curd formation or both is added to set the milk into a semisolid mass.
Calcium chloride maybe used to assist the action of rennet. The amount of calcium chlorde used should not exceed 0.02% (calculated as anhydrous calcium chloride) of the weight of the milk.

(h) During the production of Cheddar Cheese, Washed Curd Cheese, Colby Cheese, Granular Cheese, Brick Cheese, Swiss Cheese, Cruyers Cheese, Edam Cheese and Parmesan Cheese a harmless preparation of enzymes of animal or plant origin capable of aiding in the curing or development of flavor may be added in such quantity that the weight of the solids of such preparation is not more than 0.1% of the weight of milk used.

II Varieties or Kinds of Cheese

(1) Cheddar Cheese is the cheese made by the cheddar process from matted and milled curd, obtained by the action of rennet or other coagulating agent on milk. Natural coloring may be added. It contains not more than 39% of moisture and its solids contain not less than 50% of milk fat.

(2) Washed Curd Cheese (soaked curd cheese) is similar to that of Cheddar Cheese except that the slabs of curd are cut into pieces, cooled in water and soaked in water until the whey is partly extracted and water is absorbed.

(3) Colby Cheese is similar to that of Cheddar Cheese except that a part of the whey is drained off, the curd is cooled by adding water and stirring is continued so as to prevent the pieces of curd from matting.
