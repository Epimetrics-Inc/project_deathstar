<subject>SUBJECT: Guidelines on the Conduct of the Energy Conservation Program of the Department of Health (DOH)</subject>


<body>

I. RATIONALE

Government Enercon Program launched by Department of Energy requires all Department units of government including attached agencies and regional ofﬁces to reduce electricity and fuel consumption at least 10 percent. Accordingly, the following guidelines are being issued for the information and guidance of all DOH ofﬁcials and employees.

II. GENERAL GUIDELINES
1. OFFICE EQUIPMENT AND MACHINES
a. Air-Conditioning System

Since air-conditioning units (ACUs) approximately consume 1000 watts of electricity daily, depending on the type and capacity of the units, it is suggested that ACUs shall be switched off from 12:00 noon to 1:00 PM.

Venetian blinds, curtains, varifolds, glass tints and other ambient separators shall be placed where there is direct sunlight to reduce accumulation of heat through the window panels as a result of heat transfers from the sun rays to the window panel.

b. Lighting System

Lighting ﬁxtures shall be turned-off from. 12 noon to 1:00 PM. Single 40 watts ﬂuorescent tube consumes 40 watts of electricity for an eight-hour use. If possible replace 40 watts shall be replaced by 36 watts for lesser wattage as indicated on its wattage ratings.

c. Computer System

Computer units shall be turned off when not in use. Doing so shall not only lessen electrical consummion but shall also prolong the useful life span of the machine/unit.

d. Other Electrically Operated Machine/Equipment

Water pumps, Xerox machines, transistor radios, electric fans, electric typewriters, fax machines including office refrigerators and the like shall be turned off while not in use. They shall be also turned off before leaving the ofﬁce to avoid damage when there is electrical voltage drop of power triff off. Turning off equipment while not in use contributes much to the electrical consumption of the government.

III. Monitoring and Evaluation

To properly monitor and evaluate the DOH’s electrical consumption, the suggested format is hereby attached to be ﬁlled up by building admmistrators or administrative officers of each ofﬁce.

Each ofﬁce shall maintain equipment ledger cards and a data bank or records of equipment issued to the respective ofﬁces to include the following data:

a. Date of acquisition, acquisition cost and ofﬁce assignment
b. Description, type, model, property number & Serial number of equipment/machine
c. Dates of repair
d. Parts replaced
e. Cost of repair

The information above shall determine whether the unit is still practical/economical for repair or would have caused electrical consumption to jump high.

Below are the systematic approaches to energy conservation program as follows:

a. Conduction of an inventory of all ofﬁce equipment/machine used
b. Recording of its maintenance cost
c. Recording of electric consumption of each month
d. Tabulation of electric consumption in terms of KW/cost compared to previous consumption each month using the suggested format
e. Assessment and evaluation of energy conserVation program output

Electricity consumption of each building within the Central Ofﬁce shall be consolidated from different ofﬁces occupying a certain building so as to monitor its consumption.

IV. Responsible Officer/Marshall

All Building Administrators or Administrative Ofﬁcers of each office shall be responsible in implementing the energy conservation program of the Department and shall be speciﬁcally monitor, handle and supervise electric consumption of their respective ofﬁces.

Electric Consumption Monitoring Sheets (Annex “A”) shall be submitted by each ofﬁce through its Administrative Ofﬁcers to the General Services Division, Administrative Service, every month.

V. Effectivity

This Order shall take effect immediately.
