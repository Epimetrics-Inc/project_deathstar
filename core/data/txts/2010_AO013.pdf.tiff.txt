I. RATIONALE/BACKGROUND 

The right to health is one of the fundamental rights enshrined in Article II of the Constitution. Section 15 states that “the State shall protect and promote the right to health of the people and instill health consciousness among them.” Likewise, under Republic Act No. 7394 or the Consumer Protection Act, Filipinos have the right to obtain accurate information as to the nature, quality and quantity of the contents of consumer products, as well as the right to be protected from deceptive, unfair and unconscionable sales acts or practices.' 

As a State-Party to the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, the Philippines recognized the right of everyone to the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health. . The right to health includes the right to health—related education and information. Access to information, including the right to seek, receive and impart information and ideas concerning health issues is considered an integral component of the right to health. 

There is unequivocal scientiﬁc evidence establishing that death, disease and disability result from tobacco consumption and exposure to tobacco smoke. At present, there are about 5 million deaths a year worldwide directly related to tobacco and WHO estimates this to double by 2020, if present trends continue unchecked. By then, 70% of mortality would be taking place in developing countries. In the Philippines, 240 Filipinos die everyday or over 87,000 a year from what is clearly a preventable disease. Tobacco products contain toxic compounds and over forty carcinogens, including carbon monoxide, arsenic, benzene, butane, formaldehyde, lead, toluene, and nicotine, among others. Nicotine, a by—product unique only to tobacco, is the substance that eventually leads the smoker to addiction. 

Recognizing the magnitude of the tobacco epidemic, the Philippines, along with other States, - signed the Framework Convention on Tobacco Control (FCTC) _ the only public health treaty initiated by the World Health Organization (WHO). The FCTC requires State parties to adopt a comprehensive range of measures designed to reduce the devastating health and economic impacts of tobacco. 

On 4 September 2005, following its ratification through the concurrence of two-thirds of the Philippine Senate in accordance with the Constitution, the FCTC was transformed into municipal law. As such, the FCTC became legally binding upon state organs. 

As a State Party to the FCTC, the Philippines is duty—bound to comply with FCTC provisions in good faith, in observance of the principle of pacta sum servanda, such that, the failure of the Philippines to perform its treaty obligations under the FCTC constitutes an internationally wrongful act under the doctrine of state responsibility, a norm of general international law that every internationally wrongful act of a State entails international responsibility of that State. 

Article 11 of the FCTC provides that Parties shall, within three years after entry into force of the treaty, adopt, and implement effective measures to ensure that each unit packet and package of tobacco products and any outside packaging and labelling of such products (i) carry rotating health warnings that shall, among others, cover 50% or more but no less than 30% of the principal display area, placed in the principal language or languages and may be in the form of pictures or pictograrns, and approved by the competent national authority; and (ii) do not promote tobacco products by means that are false, misleading, deceptive or likely to create an erroneous impression about its characteristics, health effects, hazards, or emissions. The inclusion of a speciﬁc timeframe of three years in Article 11 underscores the mandatory and prescriptive nature, as well as the exigency, of the Philippines” obligation to adopt and implement effective measures in compliance with said provision. 

Article 5.2 of the FCTC mandates Parties to adopt and implement not just effective legislative, but also executive, administrative and/or other measures in developing appropriate policies for preventing and reducing tobacco consumption, nicotine addiction and exposure to tobacco smoke. ' 

Under the Constitution and the Administrative Code of 1987, the Department of Health (Department) is the competent national authority mandated to ensure the propagation of health information. In its discussion of the Department’s power to regulate private industries in the area of health information, the Supreme Court held that “[h]ealth is a legitimate subject matter for regulation by the DOH (and certain other administrative agencies) in exercise of police powers delegated to it. The sheer span of jurisprudence on that matter precludes the need to further discuss it." The Supreme Court, in its examination of the nature, purpose, and depth of the regulatory powers of the Department, cited the Administrative Code, which tasked the Department to carry out the state policy pronounced under Section 15, Article II of the 1987 Constitution, which is “to protect and promote the right to health of the people and instill health consciousness among them.” To this end, the Department was “granted under Section 3 of the Administrative Code the power to propagate health information and educate the population on important health, medical and environmental matters which have health implications.” 

The Department is likewise mandated, under the Consumer Protection Act, to protect the interests of the consumer, promote his general welfare, and establish standards of conduct for business and industry. To this end, the Department has the duty to implement measures that ensure the provision of information necessary for the protection of public health and the protection of consumers against deceptive practices. 

Evidence shows that health information with pictures communicates health risks better especially to children and young people as well as the illiterate, and increase the motivation of tobacco users to quit and to decrease their tobacco consumption. 

Pursuant to Department Order 2009-0116, the Department may promulgate an Administrative Order (Order) that prescribes policies, rules and regulations, and procedures in accordance with or pursuant to law to supplement provisions of the law or provides means for carrying them out, and is primarily applicable to individuals and organizations outside the Department. 

Through this Order, the Philippines, through the Department, is taking a deﬁnitive step towards complying with its binding international obligations under the FCTC. 

Through this Order, the Department underscores the primacy of public health and afﬁrms its primary function to promote, protect, preserve, and restore the health of the people.
