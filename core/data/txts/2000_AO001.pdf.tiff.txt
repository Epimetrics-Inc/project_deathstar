The World Health Organization has released information regarding the risks posed by the use of the drug Trovafloxacin, a recently-approved fluoroquinalone antibiotic. Cases of serious hepatic events have been reported including eases in which patients died or required a liver transplant. Data gathered from the reported cases suggest that the onset and the severity of the liver injuries are unpredictable.

In the light at the new information concerning the safety of the subject drug and upon the recommendation of the National Drug Committee (NDC) of the Department of Health, it is hereby ordered that all drug products containing trovofloxacin shall no longer be registrable.

Furthermore, the registration of all Trovofloxacin (Trovan) products are hereby, recalled and cancelled. All stocks in the different drug distribution channels should be withdrawn immediately.

This regulation is issued for the safety and protection of the consumers.
