If the equipment is repairable without the need for replacement of parts, then the mechanic services said equipment to the satisfaction of end-user. The end-user signs he Job Order Form stating that servicing or repair was accomplished satisfactorily. Said Job Order is kept on file for future reference. If however, said repair could not be accomplished due to lack of spare parts, a certification is prepared by hte mechanic as to parts needed. If parts require no special tool or equipment install, than certification for parts only is approved and passed on to the Auditor. The certification is then noted by the AuditorAfter which, it is passed to the Supply Section for purchase. Once the parts are purchased, the repair will be done by the mechanic assigned to do the said repair. On the other hand, if parts to be replaced will require special tools not available i the Medical Equipment Maintenance & Engineering Section, the certification will call for a reputable outside jobber to do the job, and the same procedure is then followed. The Supply Section takes charge of canvassing of prices and the purchase order is then made.
