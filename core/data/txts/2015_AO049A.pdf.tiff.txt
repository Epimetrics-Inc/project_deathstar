<docnum>No. 2015 - 049A </docnum>
<subject>SUBJECT: Amendment to Administrative Order No. 2015- 0049 entitled “Rules and Regulations Governing the Antimicrobial Resistance Surveillance Program Accreditation of Bacteriology Laboratories in the Philippines for the PhilHealth Reimbursement of Select Antibiotics in the Philippine National Drug Formulary”</subject>
<body>


Section II, Scope and Coverage of Administrative Order (A0) No. 2015 — 0049 entitled “Rules and Regulations Governing the Antimicrobial Resistance Surveillance Program Accreditation of Bacteriology Laboratories in the Philippines for the PhilHealth Reimbursement of Select Antibiotics in the Philippines National Drug Formulary” states applicability of rules to ‘tertiary hospitals with bacteriology laboratories”. The term used is problematic as it is not deﬁned in Administrative Order 2012 — 0012 entitled “Rules and Regulations Governing the New Classiﬁcation of Hospitals and Other Health Facilities in the Philippines”, and the inconsistency with the said order confuses hospitals applying for accreditation, as non-tertiary hospitals may also provide bacteriology laboratory services provided that the hospital has a tertiary clinical laboratory. The A0 No. 2015-0049 is thus amended to change the terminologies in the corresponding sections below from “tertiary hospitals with bacteriology laboratories” to “tertiary clinical laboratories” as deﬁned in A0 2007 — 0027 entitled “Revised Rules and Regulations Governing the Licensure and Regulation of Clinical Laboratories in the Philippines”.

(*for hospital based only) 

All other provision of the Administrative Order No. 2015-0049 shall remain in effect and provision/issuances inconsistent or contrary to this Order are hereby rescinded or modiﬁed accordingly. 

This Order shall take effect immediately.
