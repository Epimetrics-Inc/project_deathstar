Undersecretary, Office for Health Facilities, Standards and Regulation

From: CATALINA C. SANCHEZ
Program Manager

<subject>Subject: Project, “Murano Gamot Presyong DOH”</subject>

<body>

Based on the report of the Consultative Conference held on May 31, 1996 at Las Palmas Hotel, a proposed A.O. was forwarded to your Office for perusal. However, it was sent back with instruction to add in the guidelines, medicines for Senior Citizen to be sold at cost (acquisition price) with other recommendations i,e, the addition of new drugs and deletion of some in the list through another Department Order.

Thorough and further study of the Senior Citizen’s Law (RA 7432) which provides a 20% discount for the sale of drugs and medicines disclosed an infringement of the law if sold at acquisition cost.

A follow-up conference on August 16, 1996 on the subject of the deletion and addition of drugs was help at the Radio Therapy Conference Room, Dr. Jose R. Reyes Memorial and Medical Center with chief pharmacists of Metro Manila DOH hospitals in attendance. This addition & deletion was referred to the National Drug Committee (NDC) with their comments and recommendations as follows:

1. The retention of 10 essential drugs;

2. Another 10 drug items previously identified by the NDC shall be used should there be a need to expand the drug list.

Original 10

1. Amoxicillin
2. Cotrimoxazole
3. Diphenhydramine
4. Isoniazid
5. Nifedipine
6. Oral Rehydration salts
7. Paracetamol
8. Pyrazinamide
9. Rifampicin
10. Salbutamol

Additional 10

1. Captopril
2. Erythromycin
3. Ethambutol
4. Furosemide
5. Glibenclamide
6. Hydrochlorothiazide
7. Ibuprofen
8. Phenoxymethylpenicillin
9. Ranitidine
10. Aluminum Hydroxide + Magnesium Hydroxide

It was the consensus of the group that the expanded drug list from 10 to 20 items will better meet the health care need of the majority of the population.

In view of the above, the recommended drug list for the same project is incorporated in the proposed A.O. for your perusal and recommending approval thereof.
