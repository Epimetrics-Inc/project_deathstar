<docnum>No. 330 s. 1977</docnum>

<subject>SUBJECT: Restricted Use of Dipyrone</subject>

<body>
On the basis of findings of the Food and Drug Administration's Drug Advisory Committee, dipyrone, is causing fatal agranulocytosis, a blood disorder, in some patients.

This drug has been dispensed widely as "over-the-counter" drug for many years.

The Committee found:

1. Dipyrone is capable of causing and has caused fatal agranulocytosis;

2. Relatively small amounts of this drug given intermittently over a period of time, as well as regular and continued administration can precipitate the reaction of agranulocytosis;

3. In most instances, other antipyretics and analgesics that are much safer should be used in preference to dipyrone.

The Committee has recommended that:

Dipyrone should be used only as a last resort in serious and life-threatening situations when other less toxic, antipyretic drugs and other measures have failed and are not tolerated, and only with proper supervision and monitoring.

The package inserts should furnish the following information:

WARNING - THIS DRUG MAY CAUSE FATAL AGRANULOCYTOSIS.

CAUTION: This drug should be used only in those conditions in which it is specifically indicated and in which other less toxic drugs have proven ineffective or are not tolerated. The potential benefit accruing from the use of this drug must be weighed against the possibility of fatal agranulocytosis.

PRECAUTIONS: Blood studies (white blood cell and differential counts) should be performed frequently. The drug should be discontinued at first evidence of any reduction in blood cell count or sign of agranulocytosis, and the patient should be instructed to discontinue use of dipyrone if sore throat or sign of other infection appears in the mouth or throat (pain, swelling, tenderness, ulceration).

The legend: WARNING - THIS DRUG MAY CAUSE FATAL AGRANULOCYTOSIS should be indicated on the immediate container.

In the interest of consumer protections, the drug dipyrone as a single component or in combination will be available only in drugstores and on prescription. This drug shall be classified as prescription drug with the Rx symbol clearly indicated on the label.

The drug dipyrone and all products containing it will be considered misbranded -

1. for over-the-counter distribution; or

2. if the legend "Caution: Food, Drug & Cosmetic Law prohibits dispensing without a prescription" is not stated on the label.

This regulation shall take effect thirty (30) days after publication in the Official Gazette.
