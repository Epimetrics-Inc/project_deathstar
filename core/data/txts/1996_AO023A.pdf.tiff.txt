I. THE BOTICA NG BARANGAY (BnB) PROGRAM

A. GOAL

To promote equity in health by ensuring the availability and accessibility of affordable, safe and effective, quality essential drugs to all with priority for marginalized, underserved, critical and hard to reach areas.


B. STATEMENT OF POLICY

The 1987 Philippine Constitution clearly mandates the right of every filipino to health. The State, under Section II of Article XIII, shall adopt an "integrated and comprehensive approach to health development which shall endeavor to make essential goods, health and other social services acceptable to all the people at affordable cost”. Under theGenerics Law, it is the policy of the State to "ensure the adequate supply of drugs with generics name at the lowest possible cost". Under the principle of devolution, people’s participation in local governance has been institutionalized. Empowerment and self-reliance maximize initiation of development by local people and full participation of the members of the community in all phases and aspects of development process. Cohesive communities link and collaborate together on an equitable basis towards the pursuit of community development.

In view of the above, the Botica ng Barangay (BnB) project essentially aims to rationalize the distribution of common drugs and medicines among intended beneficiaries i.e., indigents. Moreover, this shall serve as mechanism for the DOH to establish partnership with Local Government Units (LGUs) and Community Organizations. It shall also optimize involvement of the Barangay Health Workers addressing the health needs  of the community. Recognizing, too, the various successful efforts and approaches in establishing Botika sa Barangay as initiated by various sectors in the spirit of partnership among groups and organizations, the DOH shall also encourage all sectors to support the BnB particularly towards its sustainability, and in support of community health development.
