<subject>Subject: Allowing the use of donated CU-T (Copper T 380 A IUD) devices by the Population Commission, as an exemption to Administrative Order No. 152 dated February 11, 1986.</subject>

<body>
In view of the request made by the Population Commission
(POPCOM) to the effect that it be allowed the use of donated CU-T devices (Copper T—38O A IUD) in its nationwide programs, this Department, upon recommendation of the Bureau of Food and Drugs (BFAD) after a careful review of current scientific publications to warrant its exemption from Administrative Order No. 152 s. 1986 re: Withdrawal of Gravigard IUD and CU-T from the market, hereby grants such request of POPCOM, subject to BFAD registration in accordance with existing law, rules and regulations. 

This exemption is granted to POPCOM on the basis on scientific documents which state, among other things, that Copper-containing IUDs are ”probably the most effective and reliable reversible method of fertility regulation available to women” (WHO Technical Report No. 753, and Contraceptive Technology Update, vol. 6, No. 2, pp. 25r36, February
1985)

This Order takes effect immediately.
