<subject>SUBJECT: Amendment to Administrative Order No. 2011-0013 dated September 12, 2011 regarding the Implementing Guidelines on the DOH Complete Treatment Pack (ComPack) to Ensure Sustainable Access to Essential Drugs and Medicines for the Marginalized Sectors </subject>


<body>
The DOH Complete Treatment pack (ComPack) program is a medicines access program designed to reach the poorest of the poor with complete treatment regimens for the top most common diseases in the country which contribute to increasing morbidity and mortality and high out-of-pocket spending for medicines and health services to majority of Filipinos. 

The DOH ComPack medicines are provided free to the identiﬁed beneﬁciaries of the Conditional Cash Transfer (CCT) program of the Department of Social Welfare and Development (DSWD). While the CCT beneﬁciaries include about three million households, there is still a portion of the poorest of the poor families in the country under‘the National Household Targeting System for Poverty Reduction (NHTS-PR) that cannot access the medicines.  

In order to carry-out the paramount goal of the program, to increase patient’s access to quality essential medicines and to improve primary health care of the poorest of the poor families, Administrative Order No. 2011-0013 is hereby amended as follows: 

Section V.I GENERAL GUIDELINES:
