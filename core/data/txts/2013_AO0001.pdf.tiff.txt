I. RATIONALE 

The 2010—2016 Philippine Plan of Action to Control TB or PhilPACT is the Philippines’s medium term plan to achieve the TB targets linked to Millennium _ Development Goals (MDGS) and the National Objectives for Health (NOH) on TB Disease Prevention and Control. The plan forms part of the health sector reform initiatives on disease prevention and control management and. is anchored on the thrusts of the Department’s universal health care, or the “Kalusagan Pangkalahatan (KP). ” Under the KP agenda, the attainment of the MDGS signiﬁes the commitment of the Departmentto control diseases that are of public health threats, and eventually protect the citizenry from ﬁnancial risks linked with diseases, such as tuberculosis. PhilPACT has been ofﬁcially issued by the Department, of Health (DOH) as A0 2010-0031 (Adeption of the 2010-2016 Philippine Plan of Action to Control Tuberculosis and Its Implementing Structures) dated November 10, 2010. 

PhilPACT has adopted an inclusive governance framework and a broader engagement process for planning and implementation. These processes provide another experience for the health sector to decentralize program management while moving the nexus of control to the LGUs. This direction in effect brings the TB program into the hands of local leaders and. stakeholders, especially for the patients whose successful treatment is the ultimate goal of the program. The national agencies headed by the DOH therefore have to provide appropriate and adequate technical and logistical support to enable the LGUs to implement an effective local TB control program. 

A0 No. 2004-154 dated June 14, 2004, established the “Implementing Guidelines for the Creation of National and Regional Coordinating Committees WCC and RCC) 0n Public-Private Mix DOTS” which laid the groundwork for the organizational structures and general policies of these committees. The need for more collaboration between the public and private sectors, in alignment with PhilPACT goals, necessitate the reconstitution-of National and Regional Coordinating Committees on Public-Private Mix DOTS to address the challenges ahead. 

 
This amendment focuses on the re-structuring of the composition of NCC and RCCs to enhance the potentials of these committees in expanding the existing NTP network and managing TB control efforts nationwide within the PhilPACT framework. The reconstitution of National and Regional Coordinating Committees on Public-Private Mix DOTS (PPMD) will ensure that activities of various stakeholders are consistent with PhilPACT and that efforts of the DOH are well coordinated with other partners, to improve the quality of DOTS implementation nationwide. Moreover, it will allow new stakeholders to contribute their specialized technical knowledge of the workings of their own sector, group or institution to the PhilPACT implementation, which is vital to a sustainable scale-up of a public-private partnership. Hence the need to stipulate the functions of the NCC and RCCs within the scheme of the Philippine strategic plan since they are to be the implementing structures of the PhilPACT. It is necessary that their roles be updated to include their delineated functions for PhilPACT since the previous issuance, which created these committees, dates back to pre-formulation of the strategic plan.
