<subject>SUBJECT: Guidelines for the 1997 Subsidy to 4th, 5th and 6th Class Local Government Units for the Provision of Subsistence Allowance for Barangay Health Workers (BHW)</subject>

<body>

I. Background/Rationale

Republic Act No. 7883 otherwise known as the “Barangay Health Workers’ Benefits and Incentives Act of 1995”, formally recognizes the valuable contribution of barangay health workers (BHW) for community health development. BHWs play a critical role in facilitating community and individual access to health information and services towards people empowerment on health. RA 7883 stipulates that an accredited BHW shall be provided a subsistence allowance in the course of his/her voluntary work in the community.

The local government code of 1991 mandates the local government units (LGUs) particularly at the municipal and city level to assume the health service implementation role in the communities while the national government is tasked with ensuring technical standards and equity in health. Thus, the activities of barangay health workers in the communities are technically and administratively supported by the LGUs.

The subsidy to LGUs for the subsistence allowance of BHWs is a support of the national government to LGU programs to facilitate efficient and effective government and people’s collaboration for a responsive and sustainable health care system. This national subsidy was made available only for the year 1997 through RA 8250 or the GAA of 1997, amounting to P 55,127,400.00.

The following guidelines and procedures specify the mechanism of accessing and disbursing the said fund.


II. Objectives:

1. To strengthen the capabilities of LGUs in harnessing the participation of barangay health
workers in community health activities.

2. To provide financial support to barangay health workers while rendering community volunteer health work in 1997. 

3. To augment the government’s efforts to provide the benefits intended for BHWs as specified in RA 7883.



III. Coverage

The subsidy fund for subsistence allowance shall cover all accredited BHWs in 4th, 5th and 6th class LGUs. This subsidy is in accordance with the stipulation of RA 7883 and its Implementing Rules and1 Regulations and RA 8250.

This subsistence allowance shall be provided to accredited Barangay Health workers on a per project/program/activity basis in the course of their social preparation, actual conduct, monitoring and evaluation of specific activities mentioned in item IV.A.2

A. Requirements for Benefit Availment by BHWs
