</subject>
<body>

I. RATIONALE/BACKGROUND 

Section 6 of Republic Act no. 10354, otherwise known as, “The Responsible Parenthood and Reproductive Health (RPRH) Act of 2012” stipulates that people, especially in geographically isolated or highly populated and depressed areas, shall have access to hospitals and facilities with adequate and qualiﬁed personnel, equipment and supplies, and shall not be neglected by providing other means such as home visits or mobile health care clinics as needed. It even mandates the National Government, through the DOH, to provide necessary funding and assistance for its effective implementation. 

Supplementary to this, Section 13 of the same law mandates the National Government and LGUs to provide Mobile Health Care Service (MHCS) appropriate to a locality’s terrain in order to deliver health care goods and services especially to the poor and the needy. This mandate is elaborated under Section 5.12 of the implementing rules and regulation (IRR) of the RPRH Act, which explained that the MHCS could be in the form of a van or other means of transportation appropriate to the terrain and health care needs of the target locality. Furthermore, Section 5.13 of the same IRR mandates the DOH to develop standards for MHCS providers, which shall deﬁne the services that they should be able to provide. Among the services contemplated by said provision are: Dispensing or distribution of family planning health products; and, Family planning procedures, which may include IUD insertion, BTL using mini laparotomy under local anesthesia, and NSV among others. 

Pursuant to the foregoing, this Administrative Order is being issued to specify the particulars for FF Outreach using MHCS aimed at providing modern family planning (FP) services in underserved areas. This Order also consider common issues in implementing medical outreach programs, namely: insufﬁcient number of available trained hospital personnel; operational difﬁculties in dealing with the logistics; absence of a clear protocol for identifying and screening clients; and, lack of clear ﬁnancial incentives for itinerant teams. Moreover, existing policies on the conduct of medical outreach cover only government providers, thus, missing on the opportunity to scale up delivery of quality modern FP services that can be brought about by including the private service providers. This Order shall provide standards for the use of MHCS during FP Outreach in order to ensure that they effectively respond to the unmet need of women especially in underserved areas. Ultimately, this Order hopes to contribute to the scaling up of the delivery of modern FP services with the end in view of reducing unmet need especially among the poor. 


II. OBJECTIVE 

A. This Administrative Order shall have the following objectives: 

1. Provide standards, protocol and management arrangements for FF Outreach, using MHCS or not, particularly for providing services, namely, bilateral tubal ligation, mini laparotomy under local anesthesia (BTL MLLA), no-scalpel vasectomy (N SV), intrauterine device (IUD) and subdermal implant; 

2. Issue concrete criteria for assessing the efﬁciency and quality of service provided by public and private FP Outreach provider; and, 

3. Furnish public and private service providers with information about available ﬁnancing sources that may be tapped for the conduct of PP Outreach using MHCS or not especially for underserved areas. 

III. SCOPE AND COVERAGE 

This Order shall apply to DOH Central Ofﬁce units, Regional Ofﬁces (ROS), DOH-retained hospitals, development partners, private health care providers, local government units, and all other entities contemplated by Sections 5.12 to 5.13 of the IRR of the RPRH Act of 2012. 

It shall cover the standards, protocol and management arrangements for the conduct of FF Outreach, whether or not using MHCS, for the provision of modern FP procedures. 

IV. GENERAL GUIDELINES 

A. FP Outreach, whether using MHCS or not, particularly those that are supposed to provide BTL MLLA, NSV, IUD, and subdermal implant services shall be conducted as an alternative approach where trained and competent team of FF providers from higher level facilities (e.g. DOH retained hospitals/ medical centers, provincial hospitals) perform selected FP services in lower level host facilities in areas Where any or all of the following conditions concur: (1) high unmet need for FF; (2) with demand for LAPM/LARC FP methods; (3) where trained service providers are either inadequate or not available; and, (4) where investing in ﬁx service sites is not feasible (i.e. low case load unless aggregated). 

B. FP Outreach shall be venues where physicians trained on BTL MLLA and other health professional trained on IUD insertion and subdermal implantation could gain proﬁciency; This can be done on the condition that a trainer shall always be present to fully supervise the conduct of services that are being rendered by said doctor or health professional and that the said trainer is the lead physician for BTL MLLA services of the Mobile FP Outreach Team speciﬁed under Section V.A. below. 

C. New FP methods shall be introduced during FP Outreach only after the conduct of health promotion activities, which has the following components: (1) Informing households and families on the new FP method; (2) Counseling of clients regarding the most appropriate method; (3) Training of providers on the provision of the new FP method; and, (4) Identiﬁcation of referral facilities for management of complications and adverse reactions.


D. The conduct of FP Outreach shall be preceded by preliminary activities that justiﬁes the need for PP Outreach, namely: organization of outreach team; identiﬁcation of host facilities; demand generation; and, counseling and screening of clients as regards appropriate services that should be provided to them.

 ANNEX C. Standard Infection Prevention Procedures

-Hand washing supplies Should be provided, including running water or a pail and pitcher. If neither of these is available, alcohol rub is not a substitute. The accepted practice is to wash hands with soap and water and for every ten times (10x) that the alcohol rub was used. This is to deal with the buildup of moisturizers that comes with the hand rub. 

-Clients must change into clean operating room clothing prior to surgery and preparation of the skin (e.g. clipping of pubic hair, swabbing with antiseptic, etc.) should be emphasized. 

-Staff must wear standard operating room gowns, masks and caps. Only new, sterile disposable gloves Should be used per patient. Do not reuse gloves even if re—sterilized  

-All instruments used for the procedure must also be sterilized between cases. 

-Finally, waste must be disposed of according to infection prevention guidelines.
