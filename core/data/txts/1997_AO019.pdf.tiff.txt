<subject>SUBJECT: GUIDELINES ON THE USE OF NICLOSAMIDE IN THE REDUCTION/CONTROL OF ONCOMELANIA QUADRI SNAILS</subject>

<body>

I. RATIONALE:

Schistosomiasis continues to be a public health problem in the Philippines. There are 2,987 snail occupying an area of 28,731 hectares distributed in endemic provinces. Recent data also show that 5.5 million of the population are exposed to the disease and 1.6 of these are at risk. 

Despite the success of the schistosomiasis control programs hence the significant reduction in the prevalence of infection, several factors tend to counter the gains achieved:unabated population growth. re-infection because of the farmers and freshwater fisherfolk’s daily activities, and environmental degradation associated with water resource development which creates foci of transmission.

It is in this context that the Department of Health is now directing its morbidity control Operations on the inclusion, of mollusciciding - the control of transmission sites, reduction of snail population and the modification of the environment suitable for the snail host, Oncomelania quadrasi through the use of Niclosamide. This is with the end-goal of reducing or eliminating infection rates in the 24 endemic provinces.

To effectively implement this program, these guidelines are hereby issued.


II. SCOPE AND COVERAGE:

There are a total of 24 target provinces and 183 municipalities, and/or 1,172 barangays as shown in annex A. These areas were chosen on the basis of the following: 

1. Prevalence rate of 10% and above

2. Prevalence-rate of 2% or below
 

III. GUIDELINES:

A. Application of Molluscicides

1. Where snails areas are present in provinces with an infection rate of 10% and above

2. Where snail areas are present in provinces with a prevalence of 2% or below which has been identified for elimination.

3. Engineering control (environmental modification) like clearing of vegetation, improve flow of water, etc., shall be employed prior to application in coordination with the LGUs and the community.

4. Mollusciciding shall be done at least twice a year.

5. For moist land, the concentration of Niclosamide WP70 shall be 1 gram per squares meter or 10 kg. per hectare. The method of application may either be by broadcast or spray.

6. For water bodies, concentration is calculated at 1ppm active ingredient of Niclosamide WP70 per cubic meter of water.

7. Maintain 1 ppm active ingredient of Niclosamide WP70 to attain full treatment for at least 8 hours.

8. The Schistosomiasis Control Team shall organize or manage the clearing operation.


B. Mollusciciding Assessment

1. Assessment on the effectiveness of mollusciciding operations is done within one (1) week after each application of Niclosamide WP70.

2. Snail, recheck shall be done twice (2x) a year within one (1) week after application of molluscicide to determine its effect on snail density, snail population and snail area using the ring or tube methods. 

 
C. Evaluation Indicators

1. The indicators for this control shall be on:

a. Snail Density

b. Snail Population

C. Snail Area


IV. RESPONSIBILITY/NATURE OF ASSISTANCE:

A. The Schistosomiasis Control Service/Regional Health Office shall be responsible for setting policies and guidelines for Schistosomiasis Control Programmes; the RED shall be responsible to supervise the activities of the Schistosomiasis Control Team.

B. The LGU shall assist in the pre—engineering control activities (environmental modification)like clearing of vegetation, improve flow of identified infested water bodies.


V. EFFECTIVITY CLAUSE:

This Order shall be effective on September 32, 1997.
