<subject>SUBJECT: Schedule of Fees for Certain Services Rendered by the Centers for Health Development in Relation to Presidential Decree No. 856 Code on Sanitation of the Philippines.</subject>


<body>

I. BACKGROUND/RATIONALE

Under Presidential Decree No. 856 Code on Sanitation of the Philippines, one of the functions of the Department of Health is to “prescribe standard rates of fees for health, medical, laboratory, and other public health services”. The Regional Health Ofﬁces, now the Centers for Health Development (CHD), on the other hand, are empowered to enforce the provisions of the law as Well as its implementing rules and regulations. Under PD 856, the CHDs are authorized to charge fees for its services. 

When setting regulatory fees and charges, the Department of Health may use as guidelines the provisions of Executive Order No. 197 dated January 13, 2000, as well as the current reforms under Fourmula One for Health. EO No. 197, entitled Directing All Departments, Bureaus, Commissions, Agencies, Offices and Instrumentalities of the National Government,  Including Government-Owned or Controlled Corporations, To Increase Their Rates of Fees and Charges By Not Less Than Twenty Percent, was issued by the Ofﬁce of the President because of noncompliance of government ofﬁces to a previous 13.0, EC. No. 159 s. 1994, which also directed government ofﬁces to adjust their fees and charges by just and reasonable rates sufﬁcient to cover the full cost of services rendered. Upon examination of the current fees charged by some CHDs, the fees fall far below the full cost of services.

Under the reform mechanisms of Fourmula One for Health, the restructuring of fees of regulatory ofﬁces, including the CHDs, is one of the strategies to support the intended reforms in health regulation. When a rationalized fee schedule is coupled with an income retention policy and performance-based fund allocation, this will help 1mprove the efﬁciency, quality of services and client— —responsiveness of regulatory ofﬁces.
