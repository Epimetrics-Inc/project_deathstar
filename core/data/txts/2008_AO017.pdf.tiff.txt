2. It shall be client friendly, and easily understandable by the clients; 
3. It shall be technically sound, where performance criteria and scoring have a logical and statistical coherence; 
4. It shall be operationaliy viable, where processes to generate and puhiish the scorecard operates within institutional mechanisms and minimizes transaction costs to health system operations; 
5. It shall be representative of performance, where performance criteria and scoring are linked to heaith system outcomes desired with the best evidence possible; 

IV. ELEMENTS OF THE LGU SCORECARD 

A) Performance Indicators 

I. The indicators in the scorecards are; subsets of the MES Perfomance Indicator Framework (PIF), which have both a perceived and substantial effect in attaining key F1 interventions, intermediate outcome and final outcomes. 
II. The LGU Scorecard has two sets or indicators (see Annex A). 
a. Set I are Outcome Indicators where annual incremental improvements in performance can be measured, and where faimess of performance by wealth or income groups can be gauged. 
b. Set II are Output indicators of health system reforms that are complex and require a start up process. Incremental improvements in performance are difﬁcult to study and measure every year. Special studies may be required to complete measurement of these indicators the equity dimension of these indicators shall not be measured. 

B) Scoring System 

1. Scoring. and assessment of performnce will be based on external and internal performance benchmarks.
a. External Performance Benchmarks shall compare the Province Wide Health System performance to the 2010 national target, and to the 2006 national average.
b.  Intemal Perfonnance benchmark shall compare Province Wide Health System performance with its own. past performance. 

2 Scorecards: will utilize color coding scheme to show level of performance that is easily understood by clients: 

Set I/Outcome Indicators 

a. Red color - The color will be used to tag Province Wide Health System performance that is lower than the 2006 national average level for a speciﬁc indicator. The color implies comparative weakness in performance and the need for substantial efforts at improvement;
b. Yellow Color - The color will be used to tag Province Wide Health System performance that is higher than the 2006 national averagelevel but lower than the 2010 national target for a speciﬁc indicator. The color implies comparatively good performance that must be maintained and optimized to reach 2010 goals 
c. Green Color - The color will be used to tag: Province Wide Health System performance that is equal to or higher than the 2010 national target for a specifc indicator. The color implies comparatively excellent performance that merits sustenance, or incentives for additional work it can do for the health system. 

Set II/Output Indicators 

d. Violet Color — reflects achievement of required system reforms 
e. Black Color - reﬁects non-achievement of required system reforms 

3. Scores shallbe given for individual PPA's.

1. The LGU Scorecard for a particular LGU shall be issued to the concerned PWHS annually. The LGU Scorecard Shall contain a brief narrative description of performance and graphical representations of performance for each PPA.

2. A Regional Management Tool shall be used by the DOH Centers for Health Development to consolidate the performance of all PWHS within the region.
