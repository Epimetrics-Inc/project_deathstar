<subject>SUBJECT: Guidelines on the Implementation of the Integrated Druq Test Operations and Manaqement Information System (IDTOMIS) for Screening and Confirmatory Drug Test Laboratory Operation</subject>


<body>
I. BACKGROUND/RATIONALE 

The enactment of Republic Act No. 9165 or “The Comprehensive Dangerous Drugs Act of 2002” mandated the Department of Health (DOH) to oversee the operation of Drug Testing Centers. An interim system called Drug Test Operation and Management Information System has been implemented since 2003 using the DOH’s existing infrastructure. In 2004, the DOH received a grant from the e-government fund to computerize the Integrated Drug Test Operations and Management Information System (IDTOMIS). 

The IDTOMIS aims to establish an Information and Communications Technology (ICT) solution for efficient and effective accreditation of drug testing laboratories and related facilities, monitoring and quality assurance of drug test operations, integration with rehabilitation centers, sharing and retrieval of relevant information for decision-making and policy formulation of various agencies using drug testing data. 

As approved by the Dangerous Drugs Board in Board Regulation No. 8, series of 2007 titled ‘Amending Board Regulation No. 2, series of 2003 entitled “Implementing Rules' and Regulations Governing Accreditation of Drug Testing Laboratories in the Philippines”,’ specifically Section 3, which states that “The Laboratory shall have access to and utilize the IDTOMIS IDTOMIS is hereby adopted for implementation until such time as need arises to revise the system and as determined by the DOH and approved by the DDB.
