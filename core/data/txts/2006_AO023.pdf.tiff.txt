<subject>SUBJECT: Implementing Guidelines on Financing Fourmula One for Health (F1) Investments and Budget Reforms</subject>

<body>
I. Background and Rationale

FOURmula ONE for Health (F1) is a strategy of the Department of Health for implementing reforms in the health sector. It emphasizes four sets of instruments that must he effectively applied in order to influence the performance of a highly decentralized public health. care system and local health core markets. These instruments include financing, regulatory, service delivery and governance instruments to influence the behaviors of target beneficiaries, public and private health care providers, and suppliers of other health goods and commodities.

Since the issuance of AO 2005-0023 and pursuant to the NSM Resolution 2005-01-01, two sets of F1 flagship programs and projects have been identified and specified, namely: (1) development of province-wide local health. systems in 16 initial convergence sites; and (2) projects to build capacity to exercise effective leadership or stewardship over the health sector. Initial estimates suggest that existing resources are not sufficient to support the requirements of these projects And, in the process of prioritizing and subsequently identifying funding sources for F1 investments, it became clear that there was an urgent need to reform the structure, allocation and execution of direct subsidies going to central and regional level health agencies and programs.

This Administrative Order is premised on the principle that financing for health reform programs can only be secured and sustained in the context of long term effort to improve the structure, allocation and execution of the central and regional level health budgets. Under current circumstances, the only available and sustainable source of financing for F1 investments would be from efficiency gains expected from budget reforms. In turn, such gains can only be optimized if budget reforms were framed using the very principles underlying F1. While some foreign assistance support is available to implement F1, the; amounts are constrained by an overall budget ceiling, especially if not preconditioned on the implementation of reforms directed at the effective use of existing funds. Budget referrals require making the best out of the subsidies to the DOH and attached agencies to improve value for money from total national expenditures. This would entail the prudent and judicious utilization of some P 15 billion in national government funds for health to influence the health spending patterns of consumers, LGUs and private providers and suppliers. Influencing a sector that spends around 10 times the DOH budget will involve asserting technical leadership over the sector, flexing regulatory muscles and using targeted incentives in toms of grants in cash and in kind, influencing procurement practices and leveraging payments for services.

As the implementation framework for health reforms, F1 maps the experience and lessons gained in the last five years against the menu of reform areas prescribed in HSRA. It then picks out those activities that have the highest impacts and are doable gives existing time and resource constraints. In so doing, F1 implementation may have to be cut up into use overlapping phases. In the first phase covering years 2006 to 2008, F1 projects that can be immediately undertaken and are necessary for the implementation of succeeding reform activities shall be implemented. In the second phase, 2008 to 2010, the subsequent set of F1 projects will be implemented.

II. Objectives

This Administrative Order aims to:

A. Provide a financing framework for F1 implementation that is anchored on budget reforms in the DOH

B. Provide policy direction for DOH offices, its attached agencies and LGU persists in terms of prioritizing activities related to health reforms.

C. Provide guidance to development persists in identifying priority areas for support or the context of the Sector Development Assistance for Health (SDAH).

D. Provide guidance to oversight agencies in health and other relevant agencies in facilitating reform implementation in the DOH and LGUs.

III. Scope and Coverage

This AO shall apply to all DOH offices/ units, retained hospitals, its attached agencies and LGU partners in terms of prioritizing resources for critical activities related to health reforms. This shall entail effective and efficient utilization of national government funds for health to influence the health spending patterns of consumers, LGUs and private providers and suppliers. The DOH through its budget reform initiatives, shall provide technical leadership over the sector and other relevant agencies in facilitating reform implementation in the DOH, LGUs, and other partner agencies and organizations.

IV. General Guidelines

A. F1 Financing Framework

1. Budget Allocation Principles

1.1 In principle, national subsidies for health shall be allocated among the F1 instruments (service delivery, financing, regulations and governance) on the basis of (1) incremental influence over health sector performance; and (2) capacity to generate revenues from operations.

1.2 The potentials for using service delivery, financing, governance and regulations as effective policy instruments are far from being realized. In broad terms national subsidies supporting the exercise of these policy instruments must be increased.

1.3 The budget for retained hospitals can be easily identified as the source for such a reallocation especially since hospitals have the greatest potential for generating own resources and since some of its services duplicate those provided by LGU facilities. However, any reallocation of subsidies away from hospitals to public health, social health insurance, governance and regulation shall only be done incrementally in accordance with expected growth in revenues and the capacity of the other F1 pillars to effectively absorb or utilize additional funds.

1.4 Budget ceilings for personal services (PS) for each unit or bureau shall be set according to the requirements of a rationalized staffing pattern derived from EO 366 and the relevant provisions of EO 102. However, the sum of individual agency PS must be kept within the overall DOH budget for PS.

1.5 Maintenance and other operating expenditures (MOOE) allocation for each major agency functions shall be divided into parts: (a) a basic allocation necessary to support commodity allocation and all other essential operations; and (b) performance enhancement animation that will be disbursed upon compliance with pre-defined and well- specified performance or output targets.

1.6 Capital outlay or facility upgrading fund for hospitals shall be pooled and be competitively accessed through the submission of proposals. Such proposals shall be evaluated in accordance with the Hospital Strategic Development Plan and on their overall contribution to the achievement of F1 objectives.

1.7 DOH units, shall be allowed greater assess and more flexible use of revenues generated in exchange for contributions to public health and sector development programs from their respective MOOE.

2. Budget Execution Principles

The DOH budgets shall be disbursed on the basis of scheduled performance benchmarks, which are consistent with the Organizational Performance Indicator Framework (OPIF). While it will take some time for the entire DOH budget process to be transformed into one that is performance based, it is important that items critical to F1 implementation immediately adopt this approach. The following shall be adopted as basic approaches of performance benchmarks for budget disbursement to the various DOH units:

2.1 Service delivery - public health: adoption of rational commodities allocation plan; development of service packages for each level of facility; issuance of guidelines on service performance with LGUs; and reallocation of DOH budget to line items supporting service level agreements with LGUs.

2.2 Service delivery - hospitals: pooling of a portion of MOOE for a performance-based fund. Performance-based funds shall be accessed by the hospitals based on attainment of performance standards which shall include service classification, quality of care, utilization rates, social support and efficiency measures, and a rationalized plan for the utilization of revenues. Upgrading funds shall be accessed thru proposals submitted by hospitals.

2.3 Health financing - For indigent program (IP) subsidies: secured expansion of IP enrollment especially at F1 sites; identification of partially subsidized IP beneficiaries; adoption of national policy on poverty targeting and means testing for LGUs to use in IP enrollment; and meeting targeted increases in support value for IP members. For IPP and formal sector: alternative membership schemes and supplemental packages.

2.4 Regulation - output based payments of MOOE; automated and harmonized processes, quarterly monitoring system; review of unit cost and fees for regulatory services; business plan for 2007 to 2010; and implementation of quality seals

2.5 Governance - sector management: implementation of province-wide plans for 16 convergence sites; development of nationwide roll-out plan; development and implementation of the Sector Development Approach for Health (SDAH); development and implementation of a monitoring and evaluation system to include a LGU health score card; and piloting of upgraded stewardship functions in selected CHDs.

2.6 Governance - internal management: implementation, monitoring and compliance both performance targets related to financial management; materials and commodities management; information management services and internal audit.

3. Approach to Financing F1 Investments

3.1 Key elements of the F1 financing strategy shall include working for an adjustment of the DOH budget ceiling using criteria that is based on need, market demand and performance as well as enacting budget line items critical to F1 implementation are protected from cuts from both the DBM or even from the DOH

3.2 Protecting the budget from cats can be made through the budget support loan, National Sector Support for Health Reform Project (NSSHRP) and which is similar to that provided under the Social Expenditure Management Program (SEMP). Moreover, such budget support loan must be disbursed only if specific conditions are met (Refer to Annex 1).

3.3 The final cost and allocation of F1 investments shall be determined by the SMCT, based on a set of allocation criteria, subject to approval by the DOH EXECOM and shall be reflected in the annual budgets of the DOE and in the overall investment plan for F1 under the SDAH.

V. Implementing Guidelines

A. F1 Financing Priorities

This section describes the activities that constitute Phase 1 of F1 implementation.

1. Service Delivery

1.1 DOH hospitals shall complement local health facility networks to protect the peer and exert pressure en the private sector to deliver competitively priced quality care. This applies especially fer specialty services if continued access to national subsidies were to be justified DOH hospitals must also contribute tn the production of health technology by conducting research and training. In the first phase of F1 implementation, the following shall be undertaken:

1.1.1 Rationalization of national subsidies for and access to revenues by DOH hospitals in terms of compatibility with local health care networks, competitiveness with the private sector, and contributions to clinical research and training.

1.1.2 Creation of a fund pool for hospital upgrading from contributions by DOH hospitals. Access to this fund shall be competitively determined and special consideration shall be made on how well a facility can recoup and sustain support for the recurrent cost implications of proposed upgrading or investments.

1.1.3 Development of a system for monitoring the quality and performance of both public (national and local) and private hospitals that includes a scheme for posting seals of excellence using a transparent and well-specified metric.

1.2 The challenge fer public health programs of the DOH is in being able to influence the performance of both LGU and private providers to meet public health objectives as described by the MDG, the MTPDP, and the NOH. In meeting this challenge, F1 priority interventions shall include:

1.2.1 Rationalized allocation and distribution of public health commodities to LGU and private providers using mechanisms that explicitly take into account considerations of need, performance and public-private utilization patterns

1.2.2 Localized approach to intensify disease prevention and control efforts following a "bottom-up" approach to identifying targets developing strategic interventions, and in managing resources coming from national local and private contributions. The development of this approach and its application shall be informed by lessons learned from advanced implementation sites particularly the 16 convergence sites.

1.2.3 Strengthened health information and surveillance system that assess risks, develop scientific guidelines and provide prompt response to emerging health threats.

1.2.4 Develop and implement service level agreement mechanisms and system for providing performance awards to LGUs in support of F1 initiatives.

2. Regulation

2.1 To begin transforming health regulatory agencies into effective instruments for improving access to quality and affordable services and commodities, F1 shall focus on the following:

2.1.1 Development and implementation of seals of excellence to provide consumer information on suppliers of quality and affordable health services, products and devices.

2.1.2 Upgrading of the capacities of regulatory agencies to perform with greater efficiency and effectiveness. An integral part of this upgrading plan is to finance the needed investments from internally generated sources. Cost recovery and a rational fee schedule and performance-monitoring measures shall guide income retention policies.

3. Financing

To ensure adequate and sustained financing for health, the following priority interventions in financing shall be made:

3.1.1 Development of a 5-year framework for managing health sector resource allocation and expenditures covering the DOH budget, budgets of attached agencies, and foreign assistance. The proposed framework shall guide the restructuring, reallocation, and execution of financial resources to align it with reform objectives and priorities.

3.1.2 Expand and sustain coverage of the PHIC indigent program. This shall include securing national subsidies for the indigent program in a manner that encourages increased LGU support or contributions.

3.1.3 Program expansion shall also include the development of a scheme that provides partial subsidies for families who are clearly poor but cannot be classified as indigents, and are also incapable of paying the basic premium under the independently paying program.

3.1.4 Develop and implement advocacy scheme for increasing enrollment of the informal sector and for schemes to expand access to enrollment by the informal sector.

3.1.5 Increase financial protection or support value especially for those covered by the indigent program through mechanisms that improve quality and health-value from PHIC benefits, and explore schemes for expanding benefits to specific target groups such as mothers and children.

3.1.6 In expanding the risk pool to include the non-poor, the PHIC shall develop alternative membership schemes to facilitate enrollment and provide supplemental benefits with the collection of additional premiums.

4. Governance

Under the governance thrust of F1, three critical reforms shall be undertaken, in order to put the DOH in a much better position to exercise leadership over the health sector:

3.2.1 The Sectoral Management and Coordination Team shall be strengthened to take the lead in developing strategic policies and programs. In the mediate term, the cluster must develop a strategy for the rollout of local health systems development models developed in the 16 convergence sites and for monitoring of the implementation of F1 priority interventions. It must improve its capacity to mobilize and align foreign assistance in support of reform implementation in a manner that is proactive and effectively coordinated. Over the long term, the cluster must take the lead in developing and evaluating policy options to allow the DOH to effectively address medium and long term risks and opportunities to advance health sector reforms.

3.2.2 The DOH shall develop an action plan to address weaknesses in financial management, procurement, materials and commodities management, information management services and internal audit. Such an action plan must include the designation and capacity building of DOH staff responsible for managing the strategic budget and expenditure reforms outlined here.

4.1.3 The capacity of the Centers for Health Development (CHD) shall be upgraded and redirected towards its main role of stewardship over local health systems development. This would range from providing assistance for the development and implementation of province-wide plans, implementation of localized disease control and prevention programs and in improving financial management, procurement, materials and commodities management, and information management services at the local level.

B. Budget Structure

In order to be consistent with F1 priorities and with the organizational structure proposed in AO 2005-0023, the existing programs and projects under the current DOH budget structure shall be distributed according to three major functions: governance and management support; policy and standards development and technical assistance, and health program implementation and coordination. Policy and standards development and technical assistance in turn will be disaggregated into: (a) standards development and technical assistance for regulation and (b) standards development and technical assistance for service delivery.

In view of this, Centers for Health Development (CHDS) shall also follow this structure: governance and management support; field implementation coordination and technical assistance; and direct service provision.

C. Management Arrangements

The following teams/clusters/offices are hereby directed to do the following tasks:

1. Sectoral Management and Coordination Team

1.1 Constitute working teams and assign F1 point persons to handle specific F1 activities. These teams shall be for both the investment planning activities in the 16 sites and for the central and regional offices;

1.2 Determine the amount, appropriate funding source and schedule of release of financing for F1 investments;

1.3 Revise and implement a new budget structure, in coordination with the Internal Management Support Team, in consonance with the Health Sector Expenditure Framework and in full consideration of all the foreign assistance support.Towards this,  relevant policy instruments shall be issued and appropriate representations to relevant bodies such as the Development Budget Coordinating Council (DBCC) and other relevant agencies shall be undertaken.

1.4 Formalize the adoption and operationalization of SDAH as framework for foreign assistance coordination and support.

1.5 Develop and implement a Health Promotion Plan for F1 targeted primarily to DOH staff and other partners.

1.6 Develop and implement a monitoring and evaluation framework for F1 which shall be consistent and complementary with performance fund criteria and with the OPIF.

2. Internal Management Support Team

2.1 Facilitate the budget restructuring process by instituting systems changes as brought about by budget reforms

2.2 Institute necessary systems reforms in line with changes in budget allocation, execution and sub-allotment to CHDs and LGUs.

3. Policy and Standards Team for Service Delivery, Regulation and Financing

3.1 Develop implementation guidelines and technical standards for priority programs in service delivery, regulation and financing.

3.2 Establish schemes and systems for the institutionalization of coordinative structures and development of performance benchmarks and appropriate tools and training packages to support the implementation of programs and projects.

4. Field Implementation and Coordination Teams

4.1 Develop implementation plans for F1 priority activities at the field level.

4.2 Support LGU through appropriate mechanisms in the implementation and operationalization of F1 priority activities.
