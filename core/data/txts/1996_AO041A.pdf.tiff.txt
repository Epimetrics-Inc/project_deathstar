<subject>SUBJECT: PRINCIPLES AND POLICIES FOR REENGINEERING THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH</subject>

<body>

I. BACKGROUND 

The Department of Health (DOH) is currently undertaking a process designed to result in the formulation of a comprehensive Reengineering Plan for its central and regional units. This is primarily in pursuance of the present administration's program on Reengineering the Bureaucracy for Better Governance

The impetus for Reengineering the Bureaucracy for Better Governance (RBBG) stems from the vision of Pres. Fidel V. Ramos of Philippines 2000 and his policy of "establishing a government bureaucracy capable of supporting the enormous tasks involved in pursuing economic and social reform programs". In line with this, the President directed the constitution of a Presidential Commission on Streamlining the Bureaucracy under the Department of Budget and Management (PCSB-DBM) to determine the desired reforms to streamline the bureaucracy. Propelled by the belief that "it is time to adopt a new bureaucratic paradigm to study the bureaucracy with a deeper and more basic perspective, and identify and isolate the fundamental issues and dysfunctions in order to develop correct and realistic solutions", the RBBG advocates an approach to streamlining the bureaucracy through a new paradigm and a new set of tools for governance. Pending the enactment of the Reorganization Law which will authorize the President to reengineer the whole bureaucracy, the RBBG is expected to be fully implemented and thereby institutionalize the needed comprehensive and speedy yet workable reforms for the entire business of governance.

The 1991 Local Government Code (LGC) also provides another basis for the current reengineering work. The implementation of the LGC has devolved primary responsibility for the delivery of basic social services from the central bureaucracies to the local government units (LGUs). The devolution of health services has transferred the power and authority to discharge basic health services and corresponding facilities, equipment and personnel from the DOH to the LGUs. While DOH remains to be the lead government agency responsible for health, it has consequently assumed a new post-devolution role and a new set of functions - from program implementation and direct service delivery to policy and standards formulation, provision of technical assistance, licensing and regulation.

Given the role of DOH in the devolved set-up, it has to adapt to changes and be responsive to the immediate and long term health needs of the people through partnership with the local government units and collaboration with the private sector and non-government organizations. It therefore has to develop and evolve the necessary mechanisms towards an appropriate health system which is supportive and promotive of the socio-economic reforms initiated by the government.

II. PRINCIPLES TO GUIDE THE REENGINEERING PROCESS

A. PRINCIPLES OF GOVERNANCE

As prescribed in the document Reengineering the Bureaucracy for Better Governance: Principles and Paradigms (PCSB-DBM, l995), a new paradigm of governance will guide reengineering efforts. This clearly defines and articulates the fundamental principles which will guide the determination of the proper scope, level, focus and structures of government intervention in society, hence, current reengineering efforts in the bureaucracy. The following principles are not mutually exclusive but are inextricably related to one another.

1. Principle of Frugality and Prioritization

A conscious and deliberate attempt will be adopted to define what the government must do on the basis of its constitutional mandate and legal issuances and what it can do within its institutional resources and constraints.

With limited resources, government needs to focus it priorities. The primary responsibility of the government is the exercise of its fundamental functions. These involve in particular, the responsibility of establishing and ensuring the provision of the appropriate social, political and physical environment within which development can occur and prosper.

The government shall exercise prudence and restraint in the use of its resources by prioritizing, re-defining and focusing its role and operations. Also, where government is to intervene directly, it shall engage in high-leverage operations i.e., those that will generate the most socio-economic returns or impact for the least amount of effort and inputs.

2. Principle of Steering

The government will assume an indirect role in the sectors, intervening through market mechanisms. It will likewise find ways to create conditions to stimulate more private sector participation. The role of the national government in the sectors shall be to steer rather than to row. It will mobilize the instruments that contribute to achieving sectoral objectives.

Under the devolved set-up, the LGUs are at the helm of direct health service delivery. As such, they will be mainly responsible for assessing and responding to local health conditions. As the lead national government agency for health, the primary responsibility of the DOH is therefore to assist and support the local governments in improving their capacity to respond to local health needs. It is DOH's obligation to create the appropriate conditions so that public health goals are attained across the varying conditions and priorities of the each of the local governments. To perform this, the DOH needs to set national health policy, formulate national health plans, establish health standards and regulations and at the same time, establish operating links with LGUs and the private sector.

3. Principle of Compartmentalization

Vertical Compartmentalization. To the extent possible, societal functions and activities of the government should be so organized as to reduce duplication of effort and maximize the use of all resources to achieve socio-economic and political goals. Sectoral activities shall be properly distributed among levels of government - central and local governments and government corporations.

Devolution-responsiveness. The proper role of the national government is to set national policy and standards and assist, oversee and monitor local government units. The national government shall continuously devolve to local government units the authority, responsibility and accountability to make decisions and undertake actions on local public health issues.

With major responsibilities for health services devolved to the LGUs, the current reengineering work should be able to respond to the challenges posed by devolution. It is now incumbent upon the DOH to ensure that devolution contributes to the improvement in the delivery of health services by the LGUs. It shall guarantee smooth transition of key health functions to the
LGUs through a responsive, efficient, service-oriented health bureaucracy.

Horizontal Compartmentalization. The functions and activities of the Executive Branch will be arranged in relation to one another to ensure that there are no unnecessary duplications, that no effort is wasted, and that all necessary steps are taken in the right order, thereby contributing efficiently towards common objectives.

B PURSUIT OF TECHNICAL EXCELLENCE

The DOH, through reengineering, shall come up with an organizational structure to be composed of technically-competent, innovative, productive and well-motivated managers and technical experts.


III. POLICY GUIDELINES FOR THE DOH REENGINEERING

1. Discussions on Reengineering shall proceed from the proposed DOH Organizational Structure attached as Annex A (Model 3 - National). This model was presented, deliberated upon and was selected from among various models by top management and officials of the Department in a participative process which began in early 1996.

As shown in the Annex; the DOH shall be composed of the Office of the Secretary with the following major offices:

a. Office of National Health Policy and Standards Development
b. Office of Local Health Development and Standards Enforcement which shall include the Regional Health Offices, and
c. Office of Management

As an additional reference, a matrix of the major functions of each of the Offices and an outline of Key Result Areas supporting model 3 are also presented in Annex B.

2. A policy of broad-based consultation shall be adopted. Participatory mechanisms shall be set-up so that interested parties are given the opportunity to be involved. This will also ensure transparency of reengineering processes.

3. In pursuit of reengineering, there shall be no laying off and/or separation of officials and employees without due regard for the security of their tenure and other rights in accordance to the Attrition Law, (RA 7430), Civil Service Law (RA 6656) and
the Magna Carta of Public Health Workers (RA 7305).

IV. INSTITUTIONAL SUPPORT
