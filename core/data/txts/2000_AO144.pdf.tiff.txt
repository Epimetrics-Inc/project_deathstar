<subject>SUBJECT: GUIDELINES ON THE HANDLING AND TREATMENT OF CHILDREN INVOLVED IN ARMED CONFLICT</subject>

<body>
 
I. RATIONALE

Internal armed conflicts have always affected children and their families. For the past two decades, an estimated five million children have been affected or exposed to armed violence in the Philippines. The inaccessible location of their communities, unstable peace and order conditions have severely hampered the delivery of basic services. Thus, children are exposed to the risk of illnesses, malnutrition, psychological  trauma, injury and even death.

Recently more and more children are displaced or involved in armed violence. Deprived of their basic human rights and opportunity to enjoy a normal childhood and a bright future, they have become victims of circumstances rather than offenders of society. Children are declared zones of peace and therefore should never be involved in armed hostilities. Rescued and surrendered children in armed conflict should be treated with special care and their rights must be protected at all times without discrimination.

Relative to this concern, the DOH established the Women and Children Protection Unit (WCPU) through A.O. 1—B s. 1998 in response to the Memorandum from the Office of the President re “Call for Action Against Domestic Violence”. Under this strategy, WCPU was mandated to ensure that not only women but children in particular are provided with medical treatment in all DOH health facilities.

To provide the necessary basic health services for these children and pursuant to the Memorandum of Agreement in the Handling and Treatment of Children Involved in Armed Conflict (attached as Annex D), this order is hereby promulgated as supplemental guidelines to A.O. 1-B s. 1998 re Women and Children Protection Unit in all DOH Hospital, with focus on children involved in armed conflict situation.
