<subject>SUBJECT: ENERGY CONSERVATION AND COST-SAVING MEASURES</subject>
<body>
	In compliance With the government's nation—side campaign to conserve energy and effect savings on operational expenses, hereunder is a list of enercon and cost-Saving measures/tips for all offices/agencies of the Ministry of Health to observe and undertake:

I. ENERCON MEASURES

1. Airconditioning Units (ACUI)

a. ACU must be turned on at exactly 8:00 A.M. and turned off thirty (30) minutes before departure time. Estimated savings is P9,300.00 per annum. 

b. Avoid unnecessary opening of doors, windows and other passages where cold air may escape. Open doors and windows overwork the compressor and the desired room temperature cannot be attained. 

2. Lighting
a. Fifty percent (50%) of the lights must be put off during noon break (12: 00 noon - 1: 00 ?.M.). Estimated savings of P2, 000 per annum from this is expected in our electric bill.
b. Cleaning of fluorescent lamps and other reflectors must be done regularly. Dirty lamps emit less light than the clean ones.
 

3. Other electric office equipment

a. Turn-off electric typewriters and calculators when not in use.

b. Always unplug voltage transformer. A plugged transformer consumes power even If the connected appliance is not functioning or is turned off.

B. COST-SAVING MEASURES
1. Leaking_ water pipes and faucets should be reported immediately to the proper office for necessary repair and maintenance. Wasted water from leaks costs more in the long run than the cost of repair.
2. Use rags in dusting office furniture/equipment. Do not use onion skin papers, tissue paper or bond papers.
3. Shut off ACU and other motor operated appliances during power failure. The high surge of current at the instance that power is restored can damage the compressors and motors. 

  

Strict compliance herewith by all concerned is earnestly enjoined.
