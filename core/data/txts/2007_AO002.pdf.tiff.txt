<subject>SUBJECT: Designation of the National Epidemiology Center (NEC) as the National Internatioml Health Regulations Focal Point (NFP)</subject>


<body>

The 1969 International Health Regulations were revised in May 2005. The new Regulations will enter into force in June 2007. The new Regulations have a greatly expanded scope. They apply to diseases (including those with new and unknown causes), irrespective of origin or source, that present signiﬁcant harm to humans. They address weaknesses learned in past decades in detecting and responding to disease outbreaks. IHR (2005) aim at protecting global health security with the least interference to global travel and trade.

Adopted at the Fifty-eight World Assembly in Geneva in May 2005, the IHR (2005) become legally binding in any WHO Member State that does not reject or reserve against them by December 2006. Philippines is one of the WHO Member States that adopts the revised IHR.

Article 4, Section 1 of the revised IHR states that, “Each State Party shall designate or establish a National IHR Focal Point and the authorities responsible within its respective jurisdiction for the implementation of health measures under these Regulations." In compliance to this requirement, the Department of Health hereby designates the National Epidemiology Center as the National IHR Focal Point. As NFP, NEC shall have the following roles and responsibilities:

1. Formulate policies and guidelines for the implementation of the revised IHR.

2. Assess the existing public health system, and improve its capacity for detection, reporting and assessment of and response to public health events to meet the minimum core capacity requirements under IHR (2005).

3. Respond to WHO’s requests for verification of information (including unofﬁcial reports) regarding public health risks.

4. Notify WHO of all events that may constitute a public health emergency of international concern within 24 hours of assessment, by using a decision instrument — a ﬂow chart that goes through the criteria for assessment and notification (Annex A). Such a notiﬁcation does not necessarily mean a real public health emergency of international concern. It is a start of consultation and collaboration process between the country and WHO.

5. Collaborate with the Bureau of Quarantine in implementing routine inspection and control activities at designated international airports, ports and ground crossings to prevent the international spread of disease.

6. Make every effort to implement WHO-recommended measures.

7. Collaborate with other stakeholders and with WHO concerning IHR (2005) implementation.

All issuances which are inconsistent with the provisions of this order are hereby repealed and/or amended.

This order shall take effect immediately.
