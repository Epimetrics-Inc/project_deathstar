<body>




1. BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE 

The twenty million (19,844,578) adolescents age 10-19 years comprise 21.5% of the country’s population (NS0, 2010). Thus, they are essential to achieve the Millennium Development Goals and should be part of the national strategy to reduce poverty. Adolescents face many threats to their health and well-being. While mortality rate in this age group are low, they are susceptible to conditions that are related to their increased mobility, socialization (Valenzuela-Teoxon, 2007), and risk-taking behavior. One in every 10 young women ages 15-19 is already a mother, doubling the likelihood of maternal death compared to those over 20 years (DOH, UNFPA, WHO, 2002) and  increasing the risk of dropping out of school and facing limited economic opportunities. Sixteen (16) percent of abortion attempts occur among teenagers (Singh, 2006).Sexually Transmitted Infections, HIV and AIDS, drugs, alcohol, and smoking are also on the rise among adolescents. Drowning and transport accidents are among the, top five causes of death among the 10—14 and 15—19 age group(DOH, 2005). Three percent of young people ages 15-27 have attempted to commit suicide (UPPI/DRDF, 2002).ISsues of assault and bullying are also causing increasing concern among parents”, educators, and adolescents themselves. 

Administrative Order 34—A, s 2000, the Adolescent and Youth Health (AYH) Policy was issued in April 2000, creating the Adolescent and Youth Health Sub-program under the Program for Children’s Health Cluster of Family Health. It- envisions “well- informed, empowered, responsible and health adolescents & youth” and had a mission to “ensure that all adolescents & youth have access to quality comprehensive health care and services in an adolescent '& youth-friendly envirOnrnent 

In 2006, the Department of Health (DOH) created the Technical Committee for Adolescent and Youth Health Program (AYHP), composed of both government and non-government organizations dedicated to uplifting the welfare of adolescents and tasked to revitalize the AYHP: The committee embarked on a Strategic Plan for Accelerated Action on Adolescent Health. In 2010,_the National Center for Disease Prevention and Control (NCDPC) drafted a National Standards and Implementing Guide for Adolescent Friendly Health Facility, an Adolescent Job Aid manual and a Primer on Legal Bases for the Adolescent Health Services in the Philippines. 

Due to an increasing health risky behavior among our Filipino adolescents, the DOH embark on revising the "current policy and address the major adolescent health prOblems, marginalized groups and humanitarian emergency settings and to provide 
clear understanding among implementers and to guarantee program sustainability thus this Order developed.
