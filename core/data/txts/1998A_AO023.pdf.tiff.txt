<doctype>ADMINISTRATIVE ORDER</doctype>
<docnum>No. 23 s. 1998</docnum>

<subject>SUBJECT: Revised Schedule of Inspection of Hospitals</subject>

<body>

I. Rationale: 

Republic Act 4226 otherwise known as Hospital Licensure Law provided for the yearly renewal of license to operate and maintain a hospital and for the periodic inspection of all hospitals to check compliance with the Rules and Regulations.

For more than a decade since the creation of the Bureau of Licensing and Regulation by virtue of Executive Order No. 119, inspection has been done yearly prior to issuance of license. With the latest development at the Bureau, however, namely: the launching of Unified Licensing Scheme and the EPOS- Primex Project, coupled with the government‘s “Adoption cf Economy Measures" policy, there is a need to revise the schedule of inspection of hospitals from yearly to every two years.“ 


II. Objective Implementation

The objective of the revision is to strengthen the efficiency and effectiveness of the hospital licensing system in the Philippines.

This revision shall be implemented by all the regulation officers at the Central Office and in the Regional Field Offices to all hospitals: private and government, both retained and devolved.


III. Specific Guidelines

A. Hospitals shall be inspected every two (2) years.

B. The license to operate shall however be renewed annually as provided for in R.A. 4226

C. Monitoring of hospitals shall remain to be done yearly.


IV. Effectivity

This Order shall take effect on January 01, 1999.

All other existing issuances inconsistent with this Administrative Order are hereby rescinded.
