<docnum>No. 31 s. 1987</docnum>
<subject>Subject: Hand-carrying, follow-up and release of official papers/documents.</subject>


<body>
It has been observed that while there have been standard operating procedures in the proper coursing of= -official communication until its final release by the Central Records Section, there are still some that do not pass the said Section for release because of improper hand-carrying and/or follow up thereof by: certain interested parties or their representatives from one office to another and from one division to another in the same office. This practice hampers the dispatch of other official correspondence and creates unnecessary inconvenience on the part of officials and employees concerned especially when interested parties wait for the papers. It is therefore directed that such practice be no longer tolerated. 

       In cases, however, of important and urgent official papers the same must be acted upon without unnecessary delay, and should the hand-carrying and follow-up thereof is imperative in the interest of the service, the following guidelines are to be complied with:

l. The party or his properly identified representative must sign in the logbook/s of the office/s concerned for his receipt of the papers indicating

a. Full name written legibly,

b. His relation to the party if he is his representative and

c. Date of receipt of papers.

2. The party/representative must be instructed to bring the papers after signature/approval thereof by the authority concerned to the Records Section for official release, unless such papers are strictly confidential to the office concerned and need not be released by the said section, in which case, the Section shall not be held responsible for the files thereof.

All concerned are enjoined to be guided accordingly.
