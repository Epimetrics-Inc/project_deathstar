<subject>SUBJECT: Zinc Supplementation and Reformulated Oral Rehydration Salt in the Management of Diarrhea among Children</subject>

<body>
I. RATIONALE

Diarrhea remains to be the leading cause of morbidity and mortality in children under five years old around the world. It is estimated to cause more than 3 million deaths of children in developing countries each year (Bhutta et al., 2000). It also contributes to malnutrition among children who survived the disease. In the Philippines, diarrhea is one of the ten leading causes of death among children and the prevalence has not improved in the last five years. The National Demographic and Health Survey (NDHS) in 2003 reported that 11 percent of the children under five years of age had diarrhea and this figure indicated an increase of 57% from the 7% level in the 1998 NDHS data. The 2006 Dept of Health Field Health Service Information System reported that in 2006, Acute Watery Diarrhea is second among the ten leading causes of morbidity. There were 572,256 cases with a rate of 707.7 per 100,000 population of children under five years of age. Death due to acute diarrhea is usually due to severe dehydration which can be prevented with proper management.

The WHO and UNICEF recommends ,to Member States the new guidelines in the management of acute diarrhea that will shorten its duration, lessen the episodes and prevents immediate recurrence. Thus, an updated guideline is needed to adequately manage the disease.

The potential goals in the management of diarrhea are correction of dehydration and electrolyte imbalance, reduction of diarrheal dehydration and stool output, prevention of recurrence, prevention of malnutrition related complications, improvement of mucosal barrier and maximization of nutrient bioavailability. (Sathiyasekaran, 2005).

For over 25 years, Oral Rehydration Salts (ORS) solution has been used to prevent and treat dehydration from diarrhea, as recommended by WHO and UNICEF. This single formulation of glucose-based ORS has successfully contributed to the global reduction in mortality from diarrhea during that period. But despite this significant contribution of the standard ORS, it has been well established that it does not reduce stool output or duration of diarrhea. For this reason, researches have been made to develop an "improved" or "newly formulated" ORS. This would be at least as safe and effective as the standard ORS but, in addition, it would reduce the stool output.

The newly formulated ORS contains reduced amount of glucose and salts and total osmolarity to increase water and electrolyte adsorption. Hyposmolar solution will shorten the duration of diarrhea and the need for unscheduled intravenous fluids. Studies have shown that this newly formulated ORS solution reduces the need for supplemental IV fluid therapy, the incidence of vomiting and stool volume by 33%, 30% and 20%, respectively. This recent improvement in the management of diarrhea is officially recommended by WHO and UNICEF.

In addition, another important advancement in the management of diarrhea is now being recommended by WHO and UNICEF as an adjunct to the use of newly formulated ORS. This is the incorporation of zinc supplement in the management of diarrhea. Zinc supplements given during an acute diarrhea reduce the duration and severity of the disease and prevent subsequent episodes of diarrhea. Studies Show that 10 - 20 mg of zinc for 14 days reduced the number of episodes of diarrhea within 2 - 3 months after the supplementation regimen.

This new approach is based on a number of scientific evidences from 17 efficacy studies, 12 on acute and 5 on persistent diarrhea (Harvey, 2005). These studies have demonstrated that zinc in addition to the newly formulated ORS reduces both the duration and severity of acute diarrhea as compared to the use of ORS alone. The incorporation of zinc supplement reduces the duration of acute diarrhea by 25%, duration of persistent diarrhea by 29% and treatment failure or death in persistent diarrhea by 40%.

Vomiting is the only reported adverse effect of zinc but at the dose used in the zinc tablet, there is only a small chance of nausea or vomiting. In addition, the recommended dosage of 20 mg per day for 10-14 days showed no threat of toxicity.

The most economical form of zinc is the 20 mg dispersible, scored tablets which quickly disintegrate in less than a minute with small amount of clean water or breast milk (5ml) in a spoon. This form is suitable for children. Zinc drops and syrups are also available (WHO/UNICEF/USAID/JHSPH 2006)

The cost of Zinc supplementation for 14 days ranges from Php 62.00 (tablet) to Php130.00 (syrup). This amount is very negligible as compared to the cost of hospitalization that will be incurred when the child develops diarrhea with severe dehydration. The hospitalization expenses will range from Php2,100.00 (government hospital) to Php 9,000.00 when the sick child is confined in a private hospital.

These two recent advances in managing diarrheal disease - newly formulated ORS and zinc supplementation - can drastically reduce the number of child deaths and therefore, considered cost-effective. Global studies have noted significant reductions in the need for expensive hospitalization and use of unnecessary antibiotics and other drugs.

With the complete implementation of these new recommendations, it has been estimated that deaths due to diarrhea can be prevented by almost 90%. This can contribute significantly to the attainment of the Millennium Development Goal 4 - reduce child mortality of under-five children by two thirds.

II. LEGAL MANDATES

The government's commitment to protect the health of children is embodied in international covenants and in the national strategy like Child 2021-2025 and the Millennium Development Goals. The adoption of the IMCI strategy which combines curative and preventive strategies is considered a factor in the decline in mortality of young children.

The following laws and administrative issuances provide the mandate for the appropriate support and promotion on the use of zinc supplementation and reformulated ORS in the management of diarrhea:

A. Under Article 24 of the 1989, the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child emphasized the social responsibility of the member of the States to protect children and to provide them with appropriate support and services, emphasizing their right to the highest attainable level of health care services and guarantees the provision of and access to adequate nutrition for all infants and young children.

B. The National Objectives for Health 2005-2010 emphasized the need to reduce the mortality of under-five year old children due to diarrhea from the baseline data of 5.3 deaths per 100,000 (Philippine Health Statistics 2000) under five children to less than 1 death per 100,000 under-five children.

C. One of the components of Fourmula One Fl) as the implementation framework for the Health Sector Reform in the Philippines is Health Service Delivery. It is aimed at improving availability of basic service, particularly for the poor. The inclusion of inexpensive zinc (with ORS) in the armamentarium in Integrated Management of Childhood Illness ensures availability of basic and essential care for one of the leading preventable causes of under-five mortality in the Philippines.

D. The creation of the Food and Waterborne Diseases Prevention and Control Program (AO no.29-As. 1997; Section V) under Program Components and Strategies provides that clinical care of Food and Waterborne Diseases (FWBD) will focus on case management using ORS and rational use of diagnostic tests for FWBD. This strategy necessitates the Maternal and Child Health Service (MCHS) to provide policies and guidelines in the control of diarrheal diseases (CDD) in children 5 years and below, particularly in case management.

E. Department Circular no. 179 s. 1993 emphasized the Policies and Guidelines for the National Control of Diarrheal Disease Program which stresses the Assessment of Dehydration, Rehydration with ORS solution, Assessment of bloody stools and recommendation for antibiotics and limitation of use of drugs to Amoebiasis and Giardiasis.

III. OBJECTIVES

This Administrative Order aims to contribute to reduced child malnutrition and child deaths through more effective management of diarrhea among young children. More specifically, it aims to:

1. Transform all health institutions in both the government and the private sector and other health facilities into facilities that can promote and support the new advances/recommendations in the management of diarrhea.
2. Build critical capacity and commitment of health care staff in promoting, providing support and using the new recommendations in the management of diarrhea.
3. Link all levels of health care, including primary health care facilities with community support groups to adopt the new recommendations in the management of diarrhea as a routine practice both in the home and health facility.
4. Improve/strengthen the system of procurement, distribution and utilization system of logistics particularly Zinc and ORS.

IV. COVERAGE AND SCOPE

These guidelines shall apply to all government, private and other health facilities nationwide.

V. DEFINITION OF TERMS

A. Dehydration - loss of a large amount of water and salt from the body.

B. Diarrhea - the passage of unusually loose or watery stools, usually at least three times in a 24-hour period.

C. Dysentery - also called acute bloody diarrhea, the passage of unusually loose or watery stools with the presence of blood

D. Persistent diarrhea - the passage of unusually loose or watery stools, which lasts for 14 days or longer

E. Reformulated ORS - a new formula with reduced concentration of glucose and salt (NaCl) to avoid the possible effects of hypertonicity on net fluid absorption. It has a composition of 75meq/l sodium, 75 mmol/l glucose, and a total osmolarity of
245 mOsm/l

F. Zinc - an essential mineral that is found in almost every cell in the body. It stimulates the activity of approximately 100 enzymes, which are substances that promote biochemical reactions in the body. It also supports a healthy immune system, is needed for wound healing, helps maintain your sense of taste and smell, and is needed for DNA synthesis. Zinc also supports normal growth and development during pregnancy, childhood, and adolescence.

G. Zinc deficiency - one of the major risks to child health, linking deficiency to 10% of diarrhea, 6% of lower respiratory tract infections, and 18% of malaria morbidity.

VI. IMPLEMENTING GUIDELINES

The revised clinical guidelines on the management of diarrhea in children include the following:

A. The objectives of the treatment of diarrhea are to:

1. Prevent dehydration, if there are no signs of dehydration;
2. Treat dehydration, when it is present;
3. Prevent nutritional damage, by feeding during and after diarrhea; and
4. Reduce the duration and severity of diarrhea, and the occurrence of future episodes, by giving zinc supplements.

B. Use of reformulated Oral Rehydration Salts (ORS) for oral rehydration therapy

The new formulation has lower osmolarity ORS solution, with reduced glucose to prevent undesirable effect of hypertonicity on net fluid absorption (Implementing the new recommendation on the clinical management of diarrhea WHO/UNICEF/USAID/JHSPH 2006).

<image>table_1.png</image>

The Reformulated ORS is already approved for use in the Philippines and is already included in the Philippine National Drug Formulary (PNDF) Volume 1; 6th edition (2005).

ORS should be given to:

Children under 2 years old, approximately 50-100 ml (1/4 large cup) of ORS after each loose stool. Give older children 1/2 to 1 large cup of ORS.

Older children and adults should drink as much as they want.

ORS or recommended home-fluids such as buko juice, soup, and clean water should be continued until diarrhea stops. This may last for several days.

C. Use of Zinc Supplement

<image>table_2.png</image>

* Not yet manufactured in the country, but is now being used in selected provinces/municipalities under the UNICEF Country Program for Children 6 (CPC VI), in USAID assisted areas in Mindanao and in International Aid Zinc Study areas also in Mindanao.

D. The steps to treat diarrhea are shown below:

1. The first step in treating the child with diarrhea is to assess the child for signs of dehydration. Ask the mother of the caretaker about the child's history. Then check for the signs and symptoms of dehydration and signs of other possible important problems (refer to Table 2).

2. The next step is to select treatment and treat appropriately for degree of dehydration. In determining the degree of dehydration and the appropriate plan to treat dehydration, use the table below:

<image>table_3.png</image>

Advise family members about home treatment of diarrhea. Counsel mother on giving ORS and zinc, good food choices, including continued breastfeeding.

TREATMENT PLAN A: TREAT DIARRHEA AT HOME

Counsel the mother on the 4 rules of Home Treatment:

Give extra fluid
Give zinc supplements
Continue feeding
When to return to health facility

Rule 1: GIVE EXTRA FLUID (as much as the child will take)

A. TELL THE MOTHER
• Breastfeed frequently and for longer at each feed
• If the child is exclusively breastfed, give ORS or clean water in addition to breastmilk
• If the child is not exclusively breastfed, give one or more of the following: ORS solution, food-based fluids (such as soup, rice water) or clean water.

B. TEACH MOTHER HOW TO MIX AND GIVE THE ORS. GIVE THE MOTHER 2 PACKETS OF ORS TO USE AT HOME.

C. SHOW THE MOTHER HOW MUCH FLUID TO GIVE IN ADDITION TO THE USUAL FLUID INTAKE:

Up to 2 years - 50 to 100 ml after each loose stool
2 years or more - 100 to 200 ml after each loose stool

Tell the mother to:

• Give frequent sips from a cup.
• If the child vomits, wait for about 10 minutes before asking the child to sip from the cup again, but more slowly.
• Continue giving extra fluid until the diarrhea stops.
• Remind mother not to use sports drinks in the management of diarrhea because of its low sodium content which can cause hyponatremia and its very high carbohydrates content which can provoke osmotic diarrhea and worsen the dehydration.

Rule 2: GIVE ZINC SUPPLEMENTS

A. TELL THE MOTHER HOW MUCH ZINC TO GIVE (REFER TO TABLE 1 FOR DOSE AND DURATION)

B. SHOW THE MOTHER HOW TO GIVE ZINC SUPPLEMENTS

For infants up to 6 months dissolve the tablet in a small amount of expressed breastmilk, ORS or clean water, in a small cup or spoon. For infants and children 6 months up to 59 months old tablets can be chewed or dissolved in a small amount of clean water in a cup or spoon

C. REMIND THE MOTHER TO GIVE ZINC SUPPLEMENTS FOR THE FULL 14 DAYS

Rule 3: CONTINUE FEEDING

A. If the child is breastfeeding, breastfed more frequently and for longer period at each feed

B. Give the child above 6 months of age foods with the highest amount of nutrients and calories. Depending on the age of the child, give mixes of cereal, meat or fish. Add oil to these foods to make them energy-rich. Dairy products and eggs are also suitable. Fresh fruit juices and bananas are helpful because they contain potassium.

C. Avoid high fiber or bulky foods such as coarse fruits and vegetables and whole grain cereals. These are hard to digest.

D. Avoid very dilute soups. These are recommended as fluids but are not sufficient because they fill up the stomach of the child without providing sufficient nutrients. Do not give foods with lots of sugar. These foods can worsen diarrhea.

E. Encourage the child to eat as much as he/she wants. Offer food every 3-4 hours (six times each day) or more often to a young child. Small frequent feedings are best because they are more easily digested and preferred by the child.

Rule 4: WHEN TO RETURN

A. The caretaker should bring the child to a health worker if the child shows any of the following:

■ Passes many stools,
■ Is very thirsty,
■ Has sunken eyes, (These three signs suggest the child is dehydrated)
■ Seems not to be getting better after 3 days,
■ Has a fever,
■ Does not eat or drink.

Treatment Plan B: Treat some dehydration with ORS

A. Give in clinic/health center the recommended amount of ORS over 4-hour period

<image>table_4.png</image>

• If the child wants more ORS than shown, give more.
• For infants less than 6 months who are not breastfed, also give 100-200 ml clean water during this period.

B. ADVICE THE MOTHER

■ Give frequent small sips from a cup.
■ If the child vomits, wait 10 minutes. Then continue, but more slowly.
■ Continue breastfeeding whenever the child wants.

C. AFTER 4 HOURS:

• Reassess the child and classify the child for dehydration.
• Select the appropriate plan to continue treatment.
• Begin feeding the child in clinic.

D. IF THE MOTHER AND CHILD MUST LEAVE BEFORE COMPLETING TREATMENT:

• Show her how to prepare ORS solution at home.
• Show her how much ORS to give to finish 4-hour treatment at home.
• Give her enough ORS packets to complete rehydration. Also give her 2 packets as recommended in Plan A.
• Explain the 4 rules of home treatment as shown in Treatment Plan A:

Treatment Plan C: Treatment of Diarrhea with Severe Dehydration

A. Refer to hospital for treatment
B. Treat according to Plan B or A when child's condition improves.

TREATMENT OF DYSENTERY

Treat for 5 days with an oral antibiotic for Shigella in the area. Advice mother when to return immediately to the health center.

TREATMENT OF SEVERE PERSISTENT DIARRHEA (Diarrhea of 14 days or more with dehydration)

• Treat the child for dehydration before referral unless the child has another severe classification
• Give Vitamin A
• Refer to hospital

PERSISTENT DIARRHEA (diarrhea of 14 days or more with no dehydration),

Advice mother on feeding, give multivitamins and minerals including Zinc for 14 days, give Vitamin A, follow-up in 5 days and advise mother when to return to the health center

VII. REPEALING CLAUSE

The provision of previous Orders and other related issuances inconsistent or contrary with the provisions of this Administrative Order are hereby revised, modified, repealed or rescinded accordingly. All other provisions of existing issuances which are not affected by this Order shall remain valid and in effect.
