<body>
I. BACKGROUND and RATIONALE 

In 2001, the Administrative Order— 5O-A s. 2001, National Family Planning Policy (NFPP) which ' embodies the Philippines FP program policies has refocused FP as a health intervention that will promote the overall health of all F 111p1nos by: preventing high-risk and unplanned pregnancies thus reducing maternal deaths, and preventing abortions, responding to the reproductive rights of women with unmet FP needs and promoting responsible parenthood. As such, the management 'and implementation of the program are speciﬁcally guided by the .“Four Principles/Pillars of Family Planning” namely: 1) Respect for the sanctity of life; 2) Respect for human rights; 3) The freedom of choice and voluntary decisions (Informed ChOice and Voluntarism - ICV); and 4) Respect for the rights of clients to determine their desired family size. These principles uphold the rights of the Filipino people to have access to quality health services, promote the will and - _ abilities of couples and individuals to freely choose which method to use according to their religious beliefs and ethical values and cultural background to enable them to respond to their _ needs and aspirations in pursuit of a better life 

In a memorandum to all regional directors of Centers for Health Development issued on June 29, 2006, the Department of Health (DOH) reiterated its order for national and local health managers _ and FF service providers to observe, comply and adhere to four FP guiding principles. However, through the years, ICV compliance has not been sustained reﬂecting the need to strengthen monitoring of implementation and the Issuance of guidelines on establishing ICV compliance monitoring and reporting system. 

This Order is issued to reiterate observance, compliance and adherence to the prescribed principles in the delivery of accessible quality family planning services.

g) Service providers shall ensure that informed consent have been secured from every voluntary sterilization (VS) potential acceptor prior to the performance of the procedure. 

2. To promote informed choice and voluntary decision making, three types of measures or approaches shall be adopted for implementation. These are: 

A. Measures to promote compliance to ICV 

The ﬁrst approach is creating awareness among potential FP clients, FP public and private service providers including NGOs and local chief executives to strengthen their knowledge, attitude and skills in ensuring compliance to these policies and enable potential clients to have access to broad range of choice of F P services. The awareness raising activities for particular targeted groups are as follows: 

1. Effective dissemination of information on ICV principles to potential clients especially regarding their rights to choose from and access a broad range of FF services. Public and private service providers including NGOs shall ensure that the counseling process reﬂects the principle of informed choice and leads to family planning decisions that clients make for themselves. 

2. Effective dissemination of information on ICV principles to public and private FP service providers and NGOs including Barangay Health Workers (BHWs) as referral agents through: 

- The conduct of orientation training on ICV principles and policy requirements and Compliance Monitoring and Reporting among frontline public and private service providers, NGOs and BHWs en a regular basis; 

- The implementation of the revised Family Planning Competency-Based Training (FPCBT) Level 1 and Level 2 which also contain a comprehensive discussion on ICV thereby increasing the knowledge and improve the skills of frontline service providers in providing quality FP services.

- Use of PP wall charts which explain all the FP methods. These ' shall be posted on the most visible area of the facility for the clients to read. Likewise, other IEC materials on the different FP methods shall also be available for the clients to read or take home. 

3. Advocacy to Local Chief Executives (LCEs), leader, organizations of private sector providing FP services and NGOs on ICV principles to prevent the provision of incentives among their constituents/clients as this may inﬂuence informed choice and voluntary decision making of potential FP clients. Likewise, LCEs should support and ensure the availability of broad range of FF methods by providing logistics and budgetary support to the implementation of the FP program. 

B. Compliance Monitoring and Reporting Measures 

Monitoring Compliance shall also be implemented to ensure strict adherence to the ICV requirements in the delivery of PP services. These shall include the following: 

1. Periodic ICV compliance monitoring and reporting 

The Department of Health-National Center for Disease Prevention and Control (DOH-NCDPC) shall install a functional ICV compliance monitoring and reporting system at all levels: from the DOH-Center for Health Development (DOH-CHD) to the Provincial/City Health Office (PHO/CHO) to ensure ICV compliance at the city/municipal level health service delivery facilities. 

ICV compliance monitoring shall be integrated into existing regular ﬁeld visits. ICV compliance monitoring may also be incorporated during meetings and discussions with provincial, city and municipal health personnel to identify and address potential issue-s and concerns. 

Compliance monitoring results shall be consolidated and reported to appropriate levels quarterly, while monitoring results indicating possible non-compliance shall be immediately reported to the Regional ICV Compliance Committee (Annex A. ICV "Compliance Monitoring and Reporting Flow) using the narrative report form for non—compliance "(Annex D) 

2. Use of standard ICV Compliance Monitoring Questionnaires and Reporting Forms 

ICV compliance monitoring tool for service providers/service delivery sites and clients [Annex B1 and B2, ICV Compliance Monitoring Questionnaires] and Summary Matrix (Part B) were developed to facilitate the gathering of information pertaining to compliance with the National Family Planning policies of the Department of Health. The service provider and client questionnaires serve as rapid assessment tools. 

The results of the service provider and client compliance monitoring shall be reported jointly using the standard reporting forms [Annex C. ICV Reporting Forms]. For instance, where the results from the two tools do not match, cross-checking and validation shall be conducted. In facilities where interviews of clients revealed possible non-compliance but interviews of service providers of the same facility did not reveal any possible non-compliance, there is a need to conduct a validation of the report. 

C. Implementing Corrective Measures 

If, during monitoring visits, any service provider or any relevant person (program managers, policy-makers, or the local chief executives) is identiﬁed as not compliant to the ICV policy requirement, the following steps shall be undertaken: 

1. A report of the non-compliance shall be immediately submitted to the Regional ICV Compliance Committee which upon receiving the report shall immediately mobilize the Regional Validation Team to conduct in—depth investigation. 

2. In cases that non-compliance is cenﬁnned, the Validation Team shall propose immediate corrective actions (e.g., ensure that the non-compliant practice ceases, formulationfissuance of appropriate local policies/ guidelines addressing the compliance problem and reporting requirements are complied with ) and shall immediately prepare and submit the report on the in-depth investigation together with the preposed corrective action to the CHD Director/Regional ICV Compliance Committee who shall in turn immediately submit the report with recommendations to "the NCDPC Director IV for information and possible recommendation of additional corrective action. 

3. In instances where corrective actions for ICV non-compliance "require national mandate (e.g., systems strengthening, training, policy changes), the CHD Director through the Regional ICV Compliance Committee shall submit an in-depth investigation report and recommendations to the DOH National ICV Compliance Committee through the DOH-NCDPC Director for immediate action. 

4. Proper feedback on the ﬁndings of non—compliance with the appropriate recommendations/corrective actions are relayed to, applied and implemented by the health facility concerned. The DOH National ICV Compliance Committee through the FP program manager may conduct further investigation if necessary and/or shall ensure that the committee recommendations for further corrective actions are relayed to the CHD Director for implementation and monitoring.
