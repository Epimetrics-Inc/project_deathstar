<subject>SUBJECT: Addendum to Administrative Order No. 1 3. 2003 “Operational Guidelines in the Conduct of Pre-Emplovment Medical Examination of Overseas Workers and Seafarers”</subject>

<body>
Administrative Order No. 1 s. 2003 Section III, 2. Specific Guidelines, 2.7, 2.7.1 states: "A full time psychologist registered with the Bureau of Health Facilities and Services (BHFS) shall take the full responsibility of the psychological screening and evaluation which includes the following battery of psychological tests: 1) Draw A Person Test (DAPT) or House Tree Person Test 2) Sack’s Sentence Completion Test (SSCT) 3) Bender Gestalt Motor Visual Test 4) Raven’s Progressive Matrices or Purdue Non Language Test.” 

These tests are still valid for use in the conduct of psychological examination for overseas work applicants until further notice from the Department of Health. However, there are some points to consider when using projective tests like DAPT and SSCT. Projective tests rely so greatly on subjective interpretations by clinicians and are open to a number of interpretive biases. There is a tendency to over-interpret projective-test data without sufﬁcient empirical foundation. Furthermore, persons qualified to administer and interpret DAPT require a master’s degree and a course in the psychological assessment as its minimum qualifications. As a result, psychologists without said qualifications working in medical facilities for overseas workers and seafarers are advised to use the 16 Personality Factors test, Filipino version, in lieu of the DAPT and the SSCT. 

In view of the above, since projective tests require skilled and trained administrators familiar with both the theory and structure of the tests, only psychologists with appropriate level of training should score and interpret responses. This qualification is consistent with the guidelines set forth in Standards for Educational and Psychological Testing. 

The BHFS in coordination with the National Center for Mental Health shall regularly review the minimum requirements in the conduct of psychological tests for overseas work applicants. Updates and training for psychologists administering tests for overseas work applicants shall be posted at the DOH website www.doh.gov.ph 

This Order shall take effect immediately.
