<subject>SUBJECT: Mass Treatment for Schistosomiasis Endemic Areas in CARAGA Region</subject>

<body>

Schistosomiasis continues to threaten CARAGA Region. Most recent data shows that it persists to be one of the top leading causes of morbidity during the past years. It is still endemic in 2 cities, 41 municipalities, and 221 barangays with a total exposed population close to half a million. The mean prevalence of the disease in the region is 8.44%. With the recent floodings in the area, there is the possibility of resurgence of cases in all the provinces, thus increase in prevalence rate especially if the cercarial pool from high endemic areas are brought in close contiguity with low endemic areas.

To address this public health problem in CARAGA, the conduct of mass treatment need to be initiated for the next three (3) years. This strategy will effectively reduce the high level of disease prevalence in the area at a much faster pace.

Presently, there is no specific provision under A.O. 6—A, s., 1996 that covers this particular initiative on mass treatment in CARAGA Region, hence, this inclusion.

The Addendum to Administrative Order No. 6-A, s., 1996 will be on Letter A. Strategies/ Activities, Section 1. Case—Finding and Treatment, which shall include Nos. 1.4 and 1.5, and read as follows:

I-

1.4 Mass Treatment shall cover all the endemic barangays in the provinces and cities comprising CARAGA Region.

1.5 The population to be covered for mass treatment in the endemic barangays in CARAGA Region will be ages 5 years old and above. 

All other provisions in A.O. No. 6—A, s. 1996 dated February 27,1996 remains in effect.
