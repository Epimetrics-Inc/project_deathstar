<subject>SUBJECT: Revised Roles and Functions of the DOH Representatives in support of National Health Thrusts and Directions</subject>


<body>

I. Rationale

The passage of Republic Act No. 7160 or the Local Government Code (LGC) of 1991 mandated the transfer of functions of selected national government agencies such as health and other social services to the local government units. LGC proved to be a landmark legislation and an important policy development which continually shapes the health care system.

Under a devolved set-up, important policy, functional and organizational shifts within the whole health care system had to take place. The Department of Health (DOH), as the lead government agency for health, had to refocus its role from that of a direct provider of services to that of a technical authority on health. The new roles and functions of DOH are: i) policy development ii) regulatory and standard-setting iii) provision of technical assistance and iv} resource augmentation.

DOH representatives play a very critical part in operationalizing these roles. DOH Implementing Rules and Regulations (IRR) of the LGC particularly Chapter 12, Section 47 enumerates the duties and responsibilities of the DOH representatives. Administrative Order No. 8, s. 1995 (Roles and Functions of the DOH Representatives to Local Governments and Support of the National and Regional Health Ofﬁces) was also issued to provide a more detailed listing of these duties. In view of new developments in the policy environment and given the lessons learned within the ten—year experience of devolution, there is renewed interest towards making devolution work. It is therefore relevant and timely to revisit and review AC) No. 8 in order to allow DOH through the DOH representatives nationwide, to become more accountable and more effective Local Government Unit (LGU) partners.
