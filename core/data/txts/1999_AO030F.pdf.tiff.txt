<subject>SUBJECT: The Soil Transmitted Helminthiases Control Program: Guidelines on the Implementation of the Soil Transmitted Helminthiases Control Program</subject>

<body>

I. RATIONALE

Intestinal helminthiases is numbered among the top ten infectious disease killers causing 165,000 deaths Worldwide. It causes enormous morbidity second only to diarrhea and tuberculosis (WHO Report, 1996). The World Bank Report, 1993, ranked intestinal helminthiases as the #1 disease burden among 5-14 y/o. Various surveys in the Philippines show high prevalence rate of 50-90%. It leads poor physical development and activity; reduced capacity for productive work; and causes impairment in mental development and reduction in performance in school of the affected children.

Many programs to deworm children have recently been established to efficiently control the disease and mass deworming is considered by the World Bank as the # 1 cost effective priority intervention among 5-14 y/o group. Accordingly, the Communicable Disease Control Service has created the Soil Transmitted Helminthiases Control Program, funded in 1999 under GAA (RA 8735 #III,a.10).


II. PROGRAM GOAL AND OBJECTIVES

A. GOAL:

To reduce morbidity, mortality and other effects of soil transmitted helminthiases in families and communities of provincial project sites

B. OBJECTIVES:

GENERAL OBJECTIVES: 
1. To reduce all high/medium grade intensity of infection to low intensity infection in 100% of 2-14 y/o children in project sites at end of 3 years 
2. To reduce prevalence of infection to less than 30 % in project sites at end of 3 years

SHORT TERM OBJECTIVE 

To treat 80 % of 2—14 y/o in project site for a period of three years

LONG TERM OBJECTIVES

1. To ensure practice of personal and food hygiene in 90% of households
2. To increase sanitary toilets by 10% at the end of 3 years
3. To ensure access to safe water in 80% of household


III. COVERAGE

1) A project site shall be composed of a province, to include all its component municipalities. Project duration in each project site is three (3) years. At least 5 new project sites should be covered each year.

2) Target client for targeted mass treatment

* Children aged 2-14

6-14 y/o = They harbor the greatest load of infection and are the significant source of transmission. Treatment of this age group is of public health significance since it will decrease transmission

2—5 y/o = They suffer the greatest morbidity when infected and treatment is intended for curative care for illness to alleviate impact on children in the age group


IV. DEFINITION OF TERMS

Benchmark - roles/activities identified at the start of the project which the stakeholders must fulfill before succeeding phase/activity for the project will ensue 
Community managed program — a program where people’s participation and sense of collective responsibility is maintained
Family competencies - combination of knowledge, attitude and practice competencies, which when developed in families, leads to informed, cooperative and capable families who partiCipate in the control of STH
Individual treatment— treatment is based on positive (+) stool exam
Mass treatment - giving drugs to an entire group of people without the prior diagnosis of current infection
Prevalence - measures the number of infected persons in a population
Soil transmitted helminthtiases — an infection caused by soil transmitted helminths
Targeted mess treatment — giving drugs to specific group in the community defined by age, or other social characteristics, irrespective of infection status e.g. children aged 2-14 y/o
Universal or blanket mass treatment — giving drugs to community irrespective of age, sex, infection status or other social characteristics


V. PROGRAM STRATEGIES

A Mass Treatment

1. Mass treatment of 2—14 y/o is the main strategy of the program because children aged 2-14 y/o are the most exposed or high risk group to helminth infection. They have the highest prevalence as well as intensity of infection. Studies showed that mass treatment of these age group will  automatically reduce the prevalence and intensity of infection for the whole community, thus reducing the frequency of transmission. Selective treatment will be done after 3 years when the prevalence and intensity has already been decreased. In selective treatment, only children 2—14 y/o
who are positive (+) for helminths will be given anthelminthic drug.

2. Kinds of mass treatment

a. Universal or blanket mass treatment
b. Targeted mass treatment 
c. Individual treatment

3. Target client for targeted mass treatment — children aged 2-14 y/o

4. Frequency of treatment = at least 2x a year

a. Basis for frequency is reinfection
Treatment once a year has very little effect on prevalence of STH.
Reinfection is 100 % at 6 months after treatment, hence the need to give repeated treatment at least 2x/yr

b. 2 Recommended frequency 

b.1. Department of Health (DOH) Project sites
* 2x/year — minimum on Y1, Y2
* 1x/year — minimum on Y3

b.2. World Health Organization (WHO)
* Prevalence less than 50% = treat 2x/yr
* Prevalence greater than 50% = treat 3x/yr

5. Duration of treatment

Mass treatment should be done for:

a. 3 years 
Infective eggs remain viable in the soil and are able to infect people for a maximum of 2 years

b. Promotion of mass treatment once a year until PR less than 5% should be done after 3 years in each project site

6. Service Outlet

* For 2-5 we
= Family based - mother under the supervision on BHW will give the anthelminthic drug to the child

* For 6-14 y/o 
= School based — teachers under the supervision of school nurse or midwife will give the anthelminthic drug to school children

7. Drug delivery scheme
a. DOH = provide 1st dose to the Provincial Health Office (PHO) in the project site 
b. Smithkline Beecham (SB) = provide 4th dose to the PHO in the project site through the DOH
c. LGU = must develop scheme to provide 2nd, 3rd, & 5th dose
= Schemes will be worked out with core groups in project sites to include the following options:
1. LGU allotted budget (Municipal or Provincial) Contribution for succeeding doses
(e.g. municipal government provides for 2nd dose, provincial government for 5th dose)

2. NGO contribution for succeeding doses (e.g. NGO for 3rd dose)

3. Membership fee/family in STH Control “Club”

4. Retail pay by family where the family is motivated to purchase their own drug requirement on a regular basis for the project duration. Drug outlet maybe the RHU, NGO, FAMUSY, P.O. Sustainability will need to be ensured. 

8. Drugs for mass treatment

Choice of drugs

a. Quality

Criteria for choice of drugs for mass deworming:
1. Safe
2. Broad spectrum of activity 
3. Simple
a. single dose
b. standardized dose
c. easy administration by non health worker (e.g. teacher, BHW)

4. Economical
5. Quality
a. Savings is lost if drug is less effective than it should be and if
b. Development of resistance results

b. Anthelminthic activity of selected drugs
Table 1. WHO Recommended Anthelminthic Drugs
<image>table_1.png</image>

Key:
1 = 0—19 % “cure rate” — inseparable from technical errors associated with parasitological techniques used in ﬁeld examinations
2 = 20-59 % “cure rate” - moderate activity
3 = 60-89% “cure rate” - good activity 
4 = greater than 90% “cure rate” - very good activity

c. DOH recommended drugs for project use 
c.1 Albendazole, 400 mg, single, standardized dose in chewable tablet form
c.2 Mebendazole, 500 mg, single, standardized dose in chewable tablet form

* Basis of recommendation
Albendazaole and mebendazole are benzimidazole derivatives. They have the widest spectrum of activity and mode of action against the intestinal helminths. They fill the criteria for choice of drug for mass deworming as enumerated in 8a 1-5 above, although Albendazole is known to be more effective against hookworm.

C. Family Empowerment

This involves the development of family core groups and of developing 5 basic competencies among families
1) The 5 basic family competencies for development are:
a.1. to realize the impact of STH
a.2. to realize the importance of environment in causing STH
a.3. to submit to diagnosis and treatment
a.4. to realize importance of hygiene and sanitation
a.5. to utilise health resources in the community

2) Suggested methods for development of 5 competencies
<image>table_3.png</image>

D. Hygiene and Sanitation

The following are important methods in achieving long term objectives and sustained reduction in STH prevalence. It prevents further shedding of eggs thus maintaining decreased risk exposure to transmission of infection.

1. Promotion of personal hygiene as a family competency (knowledge, attitude, practice)

1.a. Washing of hands before eating and after using the CR
1.b. Wearing of slippers/shoes always
1.c. Construction of toilets
1.d. Proper use of toilet facilities
1.e. Hygienic preparation of food
1.f. Drinking of potable water

2. Toilet construction for households without sanitary toilet

2.a. Toilet bowl moulds will be provided to each community (5/prov) by the EHS
2.b. Provincial core group will schedule rotation of moulds in its component municipalities
2.c. Target of each province is to complete the gap of 20% or to reach a level of coverage of least 90-100 %

3. Promotion of use of safe water as a family knowledge and attitude competency

E. Individual Case Management

1. Case management of non-target client will primarily be the responsibility of LGUs. Community members 15 y/o and above will be given selective individual treatment.

2. Capability of RHUs to diagnose and treat STH among non-target client of 15 y/o and above-should be upgraded for them to be able to efficiently meet the anticipated increased demand from families for such services

a. Personnel skills and resources for diagnosis should be upgraded
b. Resources should be ensured for drugs and health education


VI. PROGRAM ACTIVITIES

A. Advocacy

This includes presentation of the program to LGUs, NGOs and other stakeholders to solicit participation in project.
e.g. Presentation to Provincial boards for possible project site
Presentation to large NGOs for fund assistance to project site

It may take the form of print materials, group meetings, or other trimedia

B. Surveys

1. Prevalence survey

a. This is done to get baseline data/information on the burden of STH in the community. It will also guide the planner to design an appropriate strategy or intervention for the specific area.
b. Prevalence survey should be done at the start of project (Y1) and at the end of Y2 or after the 4th dose
c. The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends that data be collected from school children since they are representative of the disease burden in the community and they are most easily accessible in the schools.
d. The prevalence survey design should employ a statistically efficient selection of a minimum of 200 students or 8 classrooms of about 30 students per classroom. Stratified random sampling design, or multi-stage stratified random sampling may be used.
e. Stool examination will be done suing Kato Katz technique. This is a practical method as it measures not only the prevalence rate but also the intensity of infection.

2. KAP survey

a. KAP survey is done to determine the levels of differences in the knowledge, attitude and practices of the people in the community and to determine adjustments required in implementing IEC plan and to measure effectivity of IEC plan/development of family competencies at the end of the project 
b. Prevalence survey sites shall be the KAP survey areas and sample size should not be less than 400/prevalence site
c. KAP survey shall be conducted by the RHMs and BHWs trained on use of survey instruments and procedures. The 1st 400 HH in each prevalence survey site shall be used as survey respondents. Respondent should be either mother, father of the HH or HH member more than 18 y/o. HW shall use interview guide as a tool.
d. Results of the survey shall be collated by the MHOs, kept on record, and copies should be submitted to PHO for purposes of evaluation at project end.

C. Manpower Development

1. Program Manpower Development

a. Academic training for national program experts should be comprehensive but condensed to equip trainees on all aspects of program management. Participants in this training will include national and regional coordinators.
b. Field program training will include structured ﬁeld experiences in actual program implementation in selected sites with ongoing programs on STH control. Participants for this training will be national and regional coordinators and selected provincial supervisors.
c. Basic and advanced laboratory skills In STH control. This training aims to improve the knowledge and skills of medical technologists in laboratory identification of STH. Participants will be national, regional, and provincial personnel. 
d. Computer software and applications training (GIS,EPI-INFO, etc.) Computer skills relevant to database development for parasite control programs will be improved. Participants will be national, regional and provincial personnel. 
e. Health information and community mobilization techniques. This will involve principles/concepts methods for health information and community mobilization for parasite control programs. Participants will be national, regional and provincial personnel.
f. Research training and fellowship. National and regional personnel will be given basic and advanced training on research principles and actual research.

2. Project Manpower development

Regional coordinators will manage training of provincial trainers. Provincial trainers will manage training of municipal trainers and healthworkers
a. Training of provincial trainors (3/province)*
b. Training of municipal trainors (3/municipality)*
c. Training of municipal health workers (1O/municipality)*

* Target competency level: 80% knowledge acquired is per standard evaluation to be administered by DOH (DIRFO)

D. Build family competencies

Strategies and scheduling of development of family competency 1-5 should be worked out by LGU using recommended tools to obtain optimum effect.

E. Mass treatment

F. Research
1. Operational researches are encouraged at all levels with a system for awarding of grants to be developed
2. Research priorities are on measurement of the effects of control programs, specially on nutrition and educational performance.

G. Monitoring
1. Monitoring will be conducted on the following levels:
a. Family
b. Community (barangay)
c. Municipality
d. Province
e. Region

2. The implementation shall follow the summary program monitoring guide
<image>table_4.png</image>

3. Monitoring indicators 

a. Input indicators
ex. # of deworming drugs available at project site

b. Output indicators
ex. # of 2-14 y/o dewormed

4. Monitoring shall be done on a regular schedule either quarterly or semi-annually.

5. A regular meeting shall be conducted to monitor the continuance of the program & to identify the problems. Submission of reports and review of  records on—site visits may be required to support monitoring function.

H. Evaluation

1. Evaluation indicators:

a. Changes in KAP
b. Intensity of infection
c. Prevalence of infection

2. The evaluation shall be undertaken at the end of the project.

3. The PSTHCC and the Regional Health Office are responsible for the evaluation process 

VII. Program Implementation

A. Mechanism

1. Phased implementation
This is necessary to keep the yearly cost of the program manageable since the cost of drugs for mass treatment is enormous.

The 3 phases of implementation:
a. Pilot implementation - YO
a.1. To provide guide for adjusting project plan for national implementation
a.2. Development of basic program tools

b. Start-up activities 
b.1. Prevalence survey 
b.2. Manpower development/training 
b.3 Development of program tools for training, family competency development, monitoring and evaluation
b.4 Development of advocacy/IEC materials (workshop/trimedia production)

c. National Implementation
At least 5 new project sites per year is recommended to create an impact on the national burden of STH. Duration of project implementation per province is 3 years taking into account the viability of infective eggs. The project will be endorsed after Y3 to the LGUs who will be in charge of the sustainability of the project

2. Integrated Implementation

a. STH control has always been identified as a good entry point program in a community because its effect is very visible e.g. people can actually see the expelled worms a day after treatment. Popularity and acceptance of programs integrated with STH control is therefore increased. Integration of STH with other mass treatment programs particularly with Filariasis and Schistosomiasis would also increase efficiency in the use of resources.
b. Integrated implementation with other programs is under study and development, initiatives at integration is highly recommended. Task Force for integration will be created to finalize operational guidelines for integration and models implemented on pilot project scale are encouraged.

c. Initials areas on integration
