I. RATIONALE 

Cancer is a leading cause of death in the Philippines and in the world. Cancer can be treated or cured when diagnoSed early. Radiation therapy IS one of the major modalities for cancer treatment in addition to surgery and chemotherapy. It is estimated that radiotherapy solely or in combination with the other modalities will be the choice of treatment that will account for at least 60 percent of known cancer diseases worldwide.

Radiotherapy is the application of high doses of ionizing radiation. in the treatment of cancer diseases” Radiation therapy is the intentional delivery of accurate and precise amount of high radiation does to defined and localized cancer volumes at the same time minimizing the radiation doses to neighboring normal cells of the patients. 

The increasing number and complexity associated with radiotherapy equipment, procedures, and techniques necessitate the regulation of radiotherapy practices in order to minimize the risks associated with the use of ionizing radiation and ensure the radiation protection and safety of the patients, workers, and members of the public from the operation of radiotherapy facilities in the Philippines. 

There are two (2) government regulatory authorities in the Philippines. The Philippine Nuclear Research Institute (PNRI) regulates the use of radioactive materials such as those used in cobalt 60 radiotherapy facilities and brachytherapy units. The Center for Device Regulation, Radiation Health, and Research (CDRRHR), formerly named the Bureau of Health Devices and Technology, regulates the use of devices emitting radiation such as x-ray machines and linear accelerators (linacs). 

There were only two linac facilities in the Philippines in 1995. However, since 2000 there has been an increase of about two linac facilities a year. Presently, there are 27 ' linac facilities operating in the country. The number of linacs is increasing while the number of cobalt 60 facilities has considerably decreased.
