<subject>Subject: Revised/Added Roles and Functions of the Municipal Health Officer, the Public Health Nurse and the Rural Health Midwife</subject>
<body>
It has been sixteen years since the adoption of the Restructured Health Care Delivery System (RHCDS) in 1975. Over this time, the roles of the frontline health providers have been evolving. One of the most significant changes is the increasingly active role of the Rural Health Midwife in the community including care of the individual, health education, and disease control.
There is now a need to update the job description of three main health service providers at the delivery point – the Municipal Health Officer (MHO), the Public Health Nurse (PHN) and the Rural Health Midwife (RHM), not so much to change their roles as to incorporate roles which they are actually performing already. These revisions are also necessary to provide working conditions and relationships which are conducive to integrating the services at the frontlines towards the needs of the clients and beneficiaries, especially the mothers and children. Recent thrusts and changes in planning, budgeting, and other aspects of management also need to be incorporated
In this administrative order, the Rural Health Unit (RHU) includes the Main Health Center and its Barangay Health Stations (BHS).
The following shall be the revised roles and functions of the MHO, PHN, and RHM:

RURAL HEALTH MIDWIFE (RHM)

1. Management: In planning, budgeting and logistics management, the RHM shall:
a. Prepare an annual heal plan for her barangays following the “area-based program planning” methodology, as much as possible involving local barangay officials and other community members. This includes collection of all necessary barangay level information needed in the plan; identification of problems and its causes; formulation of goals and measures; and identification of activities and resources required to accomplish these activities.
b. In consultation with her immediate supervisor, submit a list of her training needs based on the standard list of basic training, knowledge and kills requirement for the RHM, Annex A.

b. Make a thorough assessment of the total health needs of the clients and their families, as much as possible during the first contact with the patient.
c. Provide the range of basic Maternal and Child Health (MCH) services listed in Annex B according to her assessment of the needs of her clients and their families. These services should be provided in a continuing and comprehensive manner and with particular attention to high risk individuals and families. Continuation of health care includes, among others, completion of primary immunization doses so that all children are fully immunized before they reach one year old; completion of tetanus toxic (TT) doses of pregnant women before the deliver; promotion and monitoring of growth from birth until the age of five years; feeding of the underweight child until he/she is fully rehabilitated; and regular prenatal, natal and postpartum care including family planning services.
