<subject>SUBJECT: Establishment of a Cervical Cancer Screening Program.</subject>


<body>

I. RATIONALE

Cervical Cancer is the second most common cancer among Filipino women and ranks fifth for both sexes. Its incidence rate has persisted from the 1980’s to the present with an annual age—standardized rate of 22.5 cases per 100,000 women (UP—DOH Cervical Cancer Screening Study Group).

Cervical cancer while preventable 1s a killer disease. Of the thousands of Filipino women diagnosed of having cervical cancer 56% will die within 5 years from the time of diagnosis (UP—DOH Cervical Cancer Screening Study Group). Experiences in many developed countries however showed reductions in cervical cancer incidence and prevalence by as much as 90% through well- organized screening programs detecting and subsequently treating cervical cancer precursors. and early lesions (WHO Technical Paper). Studies have shoinn, early detection and appropriate medical management can lead to a 5—year survival Irate among 100% of women detected with precursor or very early disease stage and. {38- 90% of women detected with early lesions (Sorta LSJ, 1987; UICC,1994)

Current cancer screening is best described in general as "convenience-screening". There 1s also an acknowledged lack of public knowledge and awareness of the beneﬁts of cancer-screening tests (lUP-DOH Cervical Cancer Screening Study Group). Further if there is any awareness among the client population the cost of screening tests becomes a limiting factor for not availing of the service.

This Administrative Order hope to establish an organized cervical cancer screening program that, 13 accessibleto target clients at all levels of the Health Care Delivery System that shall lead to subsequent diagnosis and medical management of detected cases. The initiative shall ultimately bring about a reduction in cervical cancer incidence and prevalence.

II. POLICY STATEMENTS

1. An organized screening program for cervical cancer shall be established in the Health System Standard screen methods appropriate for the facility shall be made available as follows.

 <image>table_1.png</image>
 
2. Acetic Acid Wash (36%) shall be used as the screening method of choice for cervical cancer in the Philippines and shall be established at Local Health Units (RHUs/HCs), District Hospitals and Provincial Hospitals with no papanicolau smear (pap smear) capability.

3. Acetic Acid Wash (3-5%) shall be .used as a triage method before Pap smear at District, Provincial and Regional Hospitals with Pap smear capability. .

4. Colposcopy with biopsy as needed shall be a diagnostic test after positive or suspicious sereen-ﬁndings. The testIshall be provided at appropriate tertiary level health facility.

5. Pap smear shall be a monitoring diagnostic test in instances of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia stage 1 (CIN-l) ﬁndings and non—availability of colpcscopy facility The test shall be provided at secondary and tertiary level facilities with the required infrastructure and logistics.

6. Women 25—55 years old shall undergo acetic acid wash cervical cancer screening at least once every 5-7 years

7. Acetic Acid Wash shall be advocated as an alternative screening method for cervical cancer by the health and welfare sector in government, non-government organizations, professionals, and civil societies at national and local level.

8. Positive or suspicious lesion noted upon screening shall be referred immediately to a referral facility where competent specialists shall do conﬁrmatory tests such as colposcopy and tissue biopsy

9. Referral centers for cervical cancer diagnostic tests and treatment shall be established in tertiary facilities.

10. Gender sensitive counseling and disclosure shall be a component of any training program for cervical cancer prevention and control. Gender as well as culture sensitivity of health staff involved in cervical cancer screening and treatment shall be emphasized as part of quality health service delivery.

11. Sustainability of the screening program shall be ensured through local ﬁnancing e.g. subsidy from the local government unit or the health facility concerned, PhilHealth ﬁnancing, or fee for service (user fee)‘ scheme.

12. A standard system of recording and reporting shall be developed and adopted at service delivery points.

13. Periodic evaluation shall be done at all levels to assess the progress of Acetic Acid Wash and its impact on cervical cancer prevention and control initiative

14. A regular yearly public information and education campaign aimed at changing behavior shall be done via mass media and inter-personal communication within each health center to inform and entice target women about the cervical cancer screen services.

III. OBJECTIVES

This Administrative Order shall facilitate the attainment of the following objectives:

General Objectives:

1. To establish and sustain an alternative method for cervical cancer screening at the Local Health Unit level (RHUs/HCs) for women 25-55 years old.

2. To establish referral centers for diagnosis and management at local, regional and national levels.

Specific Objectives

A. Establishment of cervical cancer sciteening facilities.

1. To establish and sustain acetic acid wash (AAW) screening facilities at the Local Health Units (RHUIs/HCs).

2. To institute and maintain a registry of target women within the catchment area.

3. To screen 50- 70% of women 25— 55 years old for precursor of cervical cancer lesion at an interval of 5-7 years.

4. To develop competence of doctors, nurses and midwives at Local Health Units (RHUs/HCs) to implement AAW screen method and appropriate referral for conﬁrmatory tests, diagnosis and treatment

5. To identify and maintain referral centers for Papanicolau smear (pap smear), colposcopy, and biopsy.

6. To increase public awareness on the beneﬁts of screening tests in the prevention and control of cervical cancer.

7. To effect an improvement in the health seeking behavior of target clients through an increase in the number of women aged 25 — 55 years availing of screening test.

IV. COVERAGE AND SCOPE

This Administrative Order shall apply to public and private health providers of health facilities at all levels of the Health Care Delivery System in the country.

V. GUIDELINES AND PROCEDURES

The following guidelines shall govern the establishment of the Cervical Cancer Screening Program:

1. Identify Local Government Units (LGUs) with relative readiness-for acetic acid wash screen program. Prepare screen start-off at Local Health Units (RHUs/HCIs), District HOSpitals (DHs), and Provincial Hospitals (PHs)

2. Schedule and prepare next batch of health facilities within provinces for acetic acid wash screen coverage in the next 2— 7 years.

3. Start a facility-basedregistry of target women 25 — 55 years of age.

Invasive cervix cancer in the Philippines has its peak at age group 35 - 55 years (UIP—PGH-DQH Cervical Cancer Screen Study Group).

4. Target screen coverage of 50— 70% of women at an interval of 5 — 7 years per woman.

Many studies assumed an initial attendanCe of 50— 70%, and concluded that it is more cost-effective to increase attendance and perform fewer screenings than to screen a portion of the population at risk many times (Fans MC e1al,1996)

Occurrence of precursor and or early cervix cancer lesions is about age 25 years, 10 years before 35 years, when cervix cancer becomes clinically apparent. Carcinoma-ianitu (stage 0) takes as long as 10 years to develop into invasive disease (UP-PGH—DOH Cervical Cancer Screen S iudy Group).

As long as the compliance of women to go for a regular interval of screens is 100%, even screening only once in the women s lifetime can signiﬁcantly reduce disease incidence (WHO), particularly if test is done at age 36— 45 years (Fans MC eta], 1996).

Moreover, 84% disease reduction has been observed where screening is done every 5 years and 64% where screening is done every 10 years (WHO).

Screen intervals of less than 3 years and more than eight — 10 years proved inefﬁcient (Fairs MC et al, I996).

5. Train health staff (doctor, nurse, midwife) assigned to do acetic acid wash screen

6. Provide the necessary logistics for acetic acid wash screen

7. Standardize screen and referral methods.

8. Identify screen referral hospitals within municipalities, provinces or regions.

9. Train medical staff on cytology I(pap smear and biopsy), colposcopy and treatment methods.

10. Conduct public information and education campaign through mass media, inter-personal communication within health centers, focus groups and other fora.

All health providers in the public and private sector shall comply with the following procedures in dealing with clients for and who have undergone acetic acid wash screen:

A. Doing the acetic acid wash screen.

1. Instruct the client not to douche or use any type of lubricant, and preferably refrain from intercourse for at least 24 hours prior to examination.

2. Inform the client of the necessity of an internal examination and requeSt her to assume a lithotomy position so that her hips are slightly over the edge of the'examination table. Reassure her that she will not be hurt and ask her to breath quietly through her mouth. Do not hurry the procedure; this will avoid upsetting the patient and gain relaxation of the abdomen.

3. Inspect the vulva and the vagina for any signs of abnormality, e. g. infection, discharge or bleeding— and gently separate the labia with ﬁnger and thumb to expose the entrance to the vagina. Use a light source or a speculight.

4. Gently insert the bivalve speculum (appropriate size and moistened with warm water/saline) halfway into the vagina with blades parallel to the labia and at the same time gently pressing the area of the posterior commissure.

5. Gently rotate the 'speculum about 450 clockwise if right-handed, counterclockwise if left— handed before opening the blades. Open the blades. With little manipulation the cervix will usually come into view If this proves, imposSible, larger speculum may be used.

6. Once the cervix is visualized, lock the Speculum in the open position.

7. Inspect the vaginal walls -— they should be normally light pink with longitudinal and circular folds.

8. InspectI the cervix, with unaided eye
- It is noiinally pink 1n color, with smooth surface. The external os is generally seen as a red, horizontal; or oval opening about 0.5 cm in size.
- It is not uncommon to see what appears to be "cervical erosion" — an irregular-shaped red area extending from and surrounding the os The margin, however, is clearly deﬁned. This, in fact, is cervical ectopion (ectopy)— a condition in which cells lining the cervical canal extend beyond the os on to the surface of the cervix.
- Suspect cancer if any of the following are found-- -(1) grossly misshapen cervix, (2) ulcer or mass on the cervix, (3) ulcer has raised irregular poorly deﬁned margin, (4) mass is irregular and ragged, (5) tissue is friable and bleeds easily on contact.

9. A large cotton swab immersed in 3% acetic acid is placed on the cervix for about 2 minutes. The cotton swab is removed, followed by immediate visual inspection, with aid of speculoscope if available. The following are possible ﬁndings:
- Abnormal cervical areas would torn whitish (fades 1n 5 minutes). The patient is for immediate referral to hoSpital for colposcopy (if exam done initially in the community), or for immediate colposcopy and then biopsy if needed at hospital setting. Atypical blood vessels and/or irregular surface contour of cervix may also be seen which 1s, suspicious of cancer
- If with normal cervical. examination results, advise patient to have another screen within 5 years from-last screen.

B. Acetic acid wash screen can be aided by magniﬁcation.

1. Acetic Acid visualization of the cervixcan be aided by use of magniﬁcation.

2. A speculoscope can provide a 4 6- -power magniﬁcation.
- Pre—focusing the speculoscopy- optic prior to perfOrming the ﬁrst speculoscopy examination will save time and best prepare the examiner for this visual examination.

- To pre-focus the optic, the rubber eye shield should be placed up to the eye for viewing. (If the examiner is wearing eye glasses, fold the rubber eye shield back to place eyepiece closer to the eye glasses for wider ﬁeld of view).

- At a distance of 14-16 inches away (equivalent to string length of speculosc0pe) from any printed material, slowly adjust the lens by, rotating the focusing ring until the printed material comes into focus. The optic has various markings indicating the focal distance.

- Remember which marking is “in focus” for you to facilitate quick adjustment of the optic with each use.

- With each examination, hold the speculoscopy optic towards the eye at a distance of approximately 16 inches from the cervix. By moving closer to or farther away from the patient, the cervix will be infocus.

- The normal cervical epithelium 1s a smooth, even pale pink color with no aceto—white
areas.

- Aceto-white areas on the cervix or vagina can be visualized with speculoscopy due to the fact that abnormal epithelium, which has a high nucleari’cytoplasm ratio, appears white, particularly after washing with 3% acetic acid.

- Whitening is due to the nuclear protein becoming opaque (intercellular dehydration & coagulation of protein, makes epithelium white in areas where cell nuclei are densely packed in layers). These aceto—white areas are well demarcated and contrast with heavy epithelium.

- Positive Acetic Acid screen ﬁndings can be ﬂat white cervical epithelium, characterized by mosaicism (groups of small white epithelial cobbles), or new bizarre irregularly branching blood vessels.

C. Refer screen positive women to gynecology/colposcopy unit.

1. Immediately refer to Hospital for Colposcopy.

- If colposcopy shows (-I|-) cervical lesion, do biopsy; ,
- If cervix exam is (+) and colposcopy is (-), repeat colposcopy after 6 months;
- If colposcopy is (- ), re-assure patient and advise cervix examination within 5 years.
- If colposcopy is not available, Pap smear can be done as a diagnostic test after a positive screen test.

D. Conﬁrm presence of precursor/early cancer lesion by colposcopy.

1. The colposcopy is a stereoscopic microscope, which utilizes a bright light under 6- 60x magniﬁcations. The basic parts are:

- An optical magniﬁer which may range up to 60x
- A controllable illumination system
- A mounting device whichpermits movement and directed of the apparatus

2. A green ﬁlter is included in the optical. system, which is used for enhancement of the cervical vascular system A teaching tube, video. camera and monitor unit may be attached in the basic unit for teaching/demonstrating purposes.

3. When conducting a colposcopic examination. the followingI instruments must be prepared:
- Examination table and stool
- Bivalve speculum
- Cotton balls, gauze, cotton tip applicators, orange sticks, forceps saline, acetic-acid, iodine
- Iris hooks and ermett tenaculum 
- Endocervical speculum
- Biopsy instruments: Eppendorf, Kevorkain, Tischler, Burke or Townsend
- Endocervical curette: Kevorkain, Sims or Chanen

4. Ideally, colposcopic examination is done prior to any internal examination and biopsy. Sexual contact and douching 1s discouraged the night before the examination. Infections of the lower genital tract are treated prior to examination as this may give a falsely positive reaction to the staining agents.

- Examination 15 best carried out on the 18th-12th day of menstrual cycle. During this period, mucus is abundant and the external 05 is open.
- Menopausal womeanith atrophic cervical mucosa are treated with estrogen for 8-10 days and colposcopy is done on the last day of treatment.
- When the patient is placed in a lithot'omy position, the external genitalia is examined thoroughly. A dry speculum is inserted halfway into the vagina and is Opened carefully, avoiding scraping the mucosa of the cervix.
- Mucus is carefully removed using a cotton swab or dry gauze. During the inspection, the surface of the cervix should be moistened with normal saline This increases the visuality of the vascular pattern.
- Routine examination utilizes a 16x magniﬁcation. A green ﬁlter 13 inserted to get an optical contrast of the vessels.
- The transformation zone isidentiﬁed by locating just the original squamous-columnar junction, which marks the lower border of the transformation zone. In menopausal women, the squamo-columnar junction may be near the cervical opening and the transformation zone pulled deeper into the cervical canal
- Particular attention is placed on the vascular pattern within the transformation zone. The colposcopic examination is deemed satisfactory when the transformation zone is viewed in its entirety and the extent of the lesion deep into the cervical canal visualized.

E. If colposcopy ﬁnds a positive or suspicious lesion, do biopsy

1. After inspection under the'saline technique, 3—5% acetic acid is applied for about 2 minutes to help coagulate the mucus. Acetic acid will also temporarily remove the water from the cellsinareas where there is a high nuclear density and the epithelium will become white. The effect of acetic acid lasts for only a few minutes, thus application with acetic acid may be repeated several times.

2. The following features should be noted down:

- Exact location, extent, borders or margins of the lesions
- Its consistency, contour and color reaction to acetic asid

3. In patients with abnormal colposcopic ﬁndings, biopsy is taken from the most suspicious lesion.

4. A limitation of colposcopy is its inability to detect lesions deep in the endocervical canal. In such situation, and in cases where the squamo-columnar junction is not visible, an endocervical curetting or conization is indicated. Colposcopic appearances are reported as Grade I II and III:

- Grade I (insigniﬁcant)— flat epithelium, ﬁne caliber, regular shaped vessels, absence of atypical vessels small inter-capillary distance, corresponds to normal metaplastic, epithelium to minor dysPlasia.
- Grade II (signiﬁcant).u ﬂat, whiter epithelium, dilated caliber, regularly shaped vessels, absence of atypical vessels, unusually increased intercapillary distance; corresponds to major dysplasia or carcinoma-in- situ.
- Grade III (highly Signiﬁcant) —— very white epithelium, dilated caliber, irregular shaped coiled, often ”atypical vessels. increased but variable intercapillary distance and usually irregular surface contour (papillary epithelium or microexophytic epithelium); corresponds to carcinoma-in-situ or pre—clinical invasive carcinoma. Atypical vessels and irregular surface contour often indicates invasive carcinoma.

5. The revised Reid’s Schema (Table l)- uses colposcopic scoring to predict the histological diagnosis of the cervix lesion whether it is HSIL (high grade squamous intraepithelial; score of &gt;9), LSIL (low grade squamous intraepithelial lesion, 7- 8 score) or ISM (immature squamous metaplasia or atrOphic epithelium, &lt;5 score).

F. If positive on biopsy, do treatment.

G. Accomplish Cervix Cancer Screen Registry.

1. Establish system of registry collection Hard form accomplished 1n the ﬁeld.

2. Written ﬁlled-up forms will be converted to electronic ﬁle, with main-frame at central DOH or at Philippine Cancer Society. Central DOH to summarize and give feedback to ﬁeld centers.
