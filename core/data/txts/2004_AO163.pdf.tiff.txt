<subject>SUBJECT: Revised Rules aid Regulations Governing Registration, Licensure and Operation of Dialysis Clinics in the Philippines</subject>

<body>
I. RATIONALE

Every year the number of patients undergoing dialysis is continually increasing. Based on the Renal Disease Control Program (REDCOP) report in 2001, 11,250 Filipinos nationwide was estimated to develop End Stage Renal Disease annually. In 2003, there were 5,070 patients who were started on dialysis, of which 83% were on hemodialysis and 17% were on peritoneal dialysis. Compared to 2002 data, there was an increase of 15% in the number of patients undergoing dialysis.

Based on the 2003 data, there were 210 hemodialysis and 51 peritoneal dialysis centers nationwide. These dialysis clinics were either free-standing or institution-based. Pursuant to Executive Order No. 5, s. 1986 and Administrative Order No. 33-A s. 1994 entitled "Rules and Regulations Governing the Licensure and Regulation of Dialysis Clinics", the Department of Health (DOH) is mandated to license dialysis clinics in the country. However, majority of those dialysis centers were operating without a license.

Patients have the right to receive quality health service and this can only be achieved by having all the dialysis clinics comply with the licensing requirements set by the DOH. With the mandate of the Bureau of Health Facilities and Services to set and review regulatory policies and standards, A.O.
